242,Flu Vaccine Increases Coronavirus Risk 36% Says Military Study,Benjamin Krause,"A recent military study shows military personnel evaluated who received the flu vaccine were at 36 percent increased risk for coronavirus with varied benefit in preventing some strains of the flu.
“Examining noninfluenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively) (Table 5).”
The flu vaccine studied demonstrated varied benefit in flu prevention – – some strains showed significant benefit while others did not.

148,COVID-19 CRISIS IN RUSSIA: LOCKDOWN CRAZINESS AND OPPOSITION PROVOCATIONS,Anonymous,"In Russia, the central city clinical hospital in Reutov, Moscow Region, is forced not only to fight coronavirus infection, but also to attempt to break into its territory supporters of the hardcore pro-Western opposition (led by ‘non-system’, Western-funded politician Alexey Navalny).

One of the most recent prominent cases involved ‘opposition activist’ Anastasia Vasilyeva. He noted that if Vasilyeva and her associates somehow want to help the hospital, then they can first write an official letter addressed to it.

Although the head doctor emphasized that all the needs of the institution are met to the extent necessary by the regional Ministry of Health and the Government of the Moscow Region.

The doctor also denied reports of the neo-lbieral opposition’s supporters that the controversial video message about the lack of protective equipment that appeared on social networks was allegedly made in a Reutov hospital.",1,
74,Secret ‘COVID-19 Manhattan Project’ Led by Billionaires Seeking to Influence Trump Admin,Zero Hedge,"Last month Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey called for the bold and urgent launch of what he called “a Manhattan Project-type approach” to fight the coronavirus pandemic given the enormity of the health and economic impact, increasingly even harming US defense readiness.

Apparently there has been such a group operating behind the scenes, but very unlike the original Manhattan Project it’s a private sector initiative, funded by a tiny network of ultra-rich industry titans working closely with government contacts. Meet “the secret group of scientists and billionaires pushing Trump on a Covid-19 plan” profiled in a lengthy Wall Street Journal investigation Monday:

These scientists and their backers describe their work as a lockdown-era Manhattan Project, a nod to the World War II group of scientists who helped develop the atomic bomb. This time around, the scientists are marshaling brains and money to distill unorthodox ideas gleaned from around the globe.

They call themselves Scientists to Stop Covid-19, and they include chemical biologists, an immunobiologist, a neurobiologist, a chronobiologist, an oncologist, a gastroenterologist, an epidemiologist and a nuclear scientist. Of the scientists at the center of the project, biologist Michael Rosbash, a 2017 Nobel Prize winner, said, “There’s no question that I’m the least qualified.”

The until now secretive group is led by a 33-year-old physician-turned-venture capitalist, Tom Cahill, and is described as an elite go-between the pharmaceutical industry and Trump administration decision-makers, or an “ad hoc review board” of sorts pursuing cutting edge outside the box ideas.

The scientists include a dozen world renowned researchers, pathology experts and inventors closely networked at institutions ranging from The Scripps Research Lab in La Jolla, California, to Yale University School of Medicine to Harvard to MIT’s Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy to private companies and labs like Merck and others.

Recommendations and ideas floated by Scientists to Stop Covid-19 have already reportedly had far-reaching influence, including affecting policy inside FDA and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the group is reportedly advising close Pence aide Nick Ayers.

Among other billionaire influencers and backers to the private initiative include Peter Thiel, Jim Palotta, Michael Milken, Brian Sheth, and Steve Pagliuca, among others. As an example of how the group was previously able to get a confidential 17-page report (since published by the WSJ) recommending various introductory unorthodox approaches to fighting and treating the pandemic, the WSJ details :

“Steve Pagliuca, co-owner of the Boston Celtics and the co-chairman of Bain Capital — as well as one of Dr. Cahill’s investors — helped copy edit drafts of their report, and he passed a version to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive David Solomon. Mr. Solomon got it to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.”

“Much of the early work involved divvying up hundreds of scientific papers on the crisis from around the world,” the report describes of the team’s daily communications.

“They separated promising ideas from dubious ones. Each member blazed through as many as 20 papers a day, around 10 times the pace they would in their day jobs. They gathered to debate via videoconference, text messages — ‘like a bunch of teenagers,’ Mr. Rosbash said — and phone calls.”

Among the ‘big ideas’ described by the network of researchers led by scientist-investor Dr. Cahill, who first gained the attention of aides within the Trump administration when they listened on an early March conference call tailored toward answering investors’ questions, include the following:

Experimenting with treatments utilizing powerful anti-Ebola drugs in heavier dosages.
The possibility of renaming the virus “SARS-2,” after the 2003 China animal virus, so that the connection is better made in the public mind with a deadly disease: “the name sounded scarier and might get more people to wear face masks. They dropped it.”
The group considers Hydroxychloroquine, long a focus of interest and debate in Trump administration circles, to be “a long shot at best”.
The team has looked negatively on recent efforts to push antibody testing and ‘immunity passports’ that show recovery from the virus.
They’ve sought to reduce FDA hurdles and red tape in order to get potential successful drugs out faster, especially to streamline hoped-for ‘miracle’ cures.
The WSJ emphasizes further: “The scientists had in their research identified monoclonal antibody drugs that latch onto virus cells as the most promising treatment.”
A saliva test which is easy to administer with ultra-fast results is being pursued, one that offices and companies could utilize to make sure employees come into work virus-free each day.
Tech like smartphone apps to help track and gauge symptoms is a major focus.
The scientists are also helping to craft state and national reopening strategies for the near and long-term.

98,The CDC Confesses to Lying About COVID-19 Death Numbers,Matthew Vadum,"Can any government statistics on COVID-19 deaths be trusted?

It is an open question now that we are learning that the highly respected, world-class Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been lying to us.

This revelation comes a few days after I wrote here at American Thinker that New York City was lying about COVID-19 deaths.  The normal rules about reporting deaths have been violated by that city in the rush to inflate the body count, presumably to steer more taxpayer money to the Big Apple.

That the CDC isn’t telling the truth to Americans is no conspiracy theory:  it’s right out there in the open for everyone to see.  The CDC openly admits that it is fudging the COVID-19 death figures.

We know this because, among other truth-tellers, a plainspoken small-town physician from Kalispell, Montana, has pulled back the curtain. Dr. Annie Bukacek, MD, explained in a presentation how death certificates are made.  (See “Montana physician Dr. Annie Bukacek discusses how COVID-19 death certificates are being manipulated,” YouTube, April 6)

Why should anyone care how a certificate of death is made?

Everyone should care “today when governments are making massive changes that affect our constitutional rights and those changes are based on inaccurate statistics,” Bukacek says.

The system is deeply flawed, she argues. Few people know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician, coroner, or medical examiner, signing the death certificate.  How do I know this?  I've been filling out death certificates for over 30 years.

More often than we want to admit, we don’t know with certainty the cause of death when we fill out death certificates.  That is just life.  We are doctors, not God.  Autopsies are rarely performed and even when an autopsy is done the actual cause of death is not always clear.  Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form.  Then that listed cause of death … is entered into a vital records data bank to use for statistical analysis, which then gives out inaccurate numbers, as you can imagine.  Those inaccurate numbers then become accepted as factual information even though much of it is false. This has been the way it has been done for some time, Bukacek says.

So even before we heard of COVID-19, death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned.  When it comes to COVID-19 there is the additional data skewer, that is –get this— there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death.  The Centers for Disease Control, updated from yesterday, April 4th, still states that mortality, quote unquote, data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19.  That’s from their website. Translation?  The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same.  They call it death by COVID-19.  They automatically overestimate the real death numbers, by their own admission.  Prior to COVID-19, people were more likely to get an accurate cause of death written on their death certificate if they died in the hospital.  Why more accurate when a patient dies in the hospital?  Because hospital staff has physical examination findings labs, radiologic studies, et cetera, to make a good educated guess.  It is estimated that 60 percent of people die in the hospital.  But even [with] those in-hospital deaths, the cause of death is not always clear, especially in someone with multiple health conditions, each of which could cause the death.

Bukacek refers to a March 24 CDC memo from Steven Schwartz, director of the Division of Vital Statistics for the National Center for Health Statistics, titled “COVID-19 Alert No. 2.”

“The assumption of COVID-19 death,” she says, “can be made even without testing.  Based on assumption alone the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty.” There is a question-and-answer section on the memo.

One question is, “Will COVID-19 be the underlying cause?”

The answer is:  “The underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate.  However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause more often than not.”

Another question is, “Should ‘COVID-19’ be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?”

The answer is: 

“COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.” “You could see how these statistics have been made to look really scary when it is so easy to add false numbers to the official database,” Bukacek says.  “Those false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC.”

“The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think,” she says. 

“How many people have actually died from COVID-19 is anyone’s guess … but based on how death certificates are being filled out, you can be certain the number is substantially lower than what we are being told.  Based on inaccurate, incomplete data people are being terrorized by fearmongers into relinquishing cherished freedoms.”

It’s hard to argue with what Dr. Bukacek says, but no doubt angry social media mobs will find a way as her chilling words enlighten the populace that has been bullied into submission.

Of course, the disease’s body count is not the sole concern we should have about the Chinese contagion, but it is undeniably the primary driver of the rampant mass hysteria that has allowed state and local governments across America to crush our cherished civil liberties.

As they say in newsrooms:  if it bleeds, it leads.  Deaths are always going to be more “sexy” than confirmed cases.  It is the number that really, really counts, and Americans know this. The fraudulent death statistics also give ammunition to the legions of snitches and scolds who try to shame their fellow Americans for attending church or playing catch in an empty park or taking a harmless drive in the countryside to prevent themselves from going stir-crazy.

The fake death data from the CDC, coupled with wild guesstimates from experts, and the relentless barrage of fear porn the mainstream media subjects Americans to around the clock, have been getting results, even with a plague that is, so far at least, underperforming.

First, experts told us 2.2 million Americans would die.  Then the number fell off a cliff, plunging down to around 200,000. 

As of April 8, the number of those expected to die from the disease by August 4 was down to 60,000, or roughly a very nasty flu season.  The new figure comes from the influential model produced by the University of Washington that the White House regularly cites.

Has social-distancing, wearing face masks, hosing down packages with bleach, using hand sanitizer that is at least 60 percent alcohol, and washing hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds helped bring the grim worst-case-scenario body count down? Probably, I’m guessing, but it’s hard to know for sure.

Maybe those epidemiological modelers can be forgiven for scaring the bejeezus out of Americans.  Epidemiology is not, after all, an exact science, as its practitioners sometimes acknowledge.

But those who have force-fed modelers skewed data that led to the terrifying death forecasts that stampeded governors into pushing the nation down the road to totalitarianism need to be held to account.

Let the investigations begin.",1,
66,COVID-19: A Pretext for World Government and Totalitarianism,Kurt Nimmo,"The crazy thing about the COVID-19 “crisis” is how easy it is for the state and its media to frighten the public and manipulate ill-informed citizens into embracing economic and social decapitation. 

Blinded by scary headlines based on irrational speculation—subsequently revised downward and published on page C-23 of corporate newspapers demanding a bailout—the American people have embraced authoritarian measures supposedly imposed to win a battle against an invisible enemy. 

We are now beyond the point of no return. The inflicted economic and social damage has already taken a heavy toll and it will get worse the longer health bureaucrats, state governors, and a remarkably clueless president and his apparatchiks demand we stay imprisoned in our homes, frightened of a bug the state and its media have fictionally rendered as an insatiable and inescapable Gorgon of Doom. Scott C. Tips, president of the National Health Federation, writes:

In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)—never known for its accuracy or consistency—declared a “Pandemic” for the coronavirus and claimed that the mortality rate for the novel coronavirus disease now designated as COVID-19 was 3.4%, while that for the seasonal flu was 0.1%. Of course, the news media ran with those numbers and splashed scary headlines across the World stating how much more deadly this new virus was than the seasonal flu. The problem with WHO’s statement, however, was that they applied two different formulas for the two viruses. For the COVID-19 disease, for example, they simply didn’t count any of the mild cases of COVID-19 that resolved themselves; yet, they did with the seasonal flu. If WHO were to apply the same formula to seasonal flu cases as it did with COVID-19 cases, then the seasonal flu is revealed more truthfully as being twice as deadly as the COVID-19 virus.

In other words, the globalist WHO—essentially a PR group for transnational Big Pharma and what should be considered the health-industrial complex—is engaged in massive fraud. 

The COVID-19 aggrandizement and propaganda campaign is not simply a public relations scheme for Big Pharma and its highly dubious—and often deadly—vaccines. It also serves as a cover for authoritarian measures the ruling elite have schemed to put in place for decades, measures designed to monitor and control everything you do. Orwell’s helicopters peering in bedroom windows in search of sex offenders—or drones in search of the infected and suspected vaccine scofflaws—are now a stark reality. 9/11 wasn’t sufficient. The reach of that false flag event’s fear quotient and authoritarian measures were limited and ultimately muted. The fairy tale prospect of cave-dwelling terrorists plotting dirty bomb attacks on kindergartens and other nefarious acts of deviltry had limited effectiveness and relatively short shelf life. 

However, an invisible virus portrayed as a pandemic on par with the Black Death is far more effective than a cartoon nemesis like Osama bin Laden in the ongoing effort to move cattle—as our rulers consider us—in the preferred direction. 

In addition to “smart” surveillance and control of the populace, the virus panic is being manipulated to cover and shift blame for a ransacked economy. 

“The economy was already faltering. The false boom stimulated by a decade of monetary meth was likely turning to bust even before the virus,” writes Keith Weiner. 

The real culprits pushing for economic collapse—the globalist fiAnonymouscial class and kindred corporate fascists—want to attribute slamming on the economic brakes and toppling an already precarious house of cards to a virus that so far is little worse than seasonal flu, if that. 

It is now obvious a thoroughly propagandized populace will readily accept what amounts to an open-ended house arrest and the nonsensical authoritarian demands of the state—don’t go outside, don’t go to the grocery store or pharmacy, fashion DIY masks out of t-shirts and furnace filters, snitch on your neighbors if you suspect an infection, condemn the preppers as selfish hoarders, et cetera. 

Our future is no longer in doubt. The psychopathic control freaks are steering us toward world totalitarianism. Henry Kissinger recently advocated as much in the War Street Journal, following up a similar call for by the former “Right Honorable” Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. A virus has accomplished what the war on manufactured terror was unable to pull off—driving us with nary a bleat of complaint toward the rocks of economic and social destruction. ",1,
146,COVID-19 Is Used As A Tool Of Fear And Terror By The EU,Anonymous,"Fear is being spread around us by the establishment through the mass media (MSM). Common sense is gone and mass hysteria is the new normal. A virus, COVID-19, is used to control the lives of people, and it's also a tool of suppression against the population.
I am not going to claim whether there is a virus or not, whether it’s as dangerous as they say, or where it originated, be it in a laboratory or bio-weapon or a real virus. I only see that it has brought fear and, already in some EU countries, terror among the population.

Easter 2020; where EU governments forbid us to see our beloved ones, where EU governments forbid us to travel, where most of us lose their income because they forbid us to work and take our bread without compensation. Where they tell us to wait until there is a vaccination from Bill Gates and his sponsors, the criminal gang of the Rockefellers (sponsors of the John Hopkins University). They are controlling our lives, our children's lives. If there is a virus, we can protect the elderly and sick but not destroy whole nations and people. I laughed about conspiracy thinkers in the past, but a lot of it is now reality and “new normal” as they call it. It’s 1984, and we didn’t do a thing to stop it, maybe it was too overwhelming.

EU Statement

The EU is mistreating, according to the law, the elderly and sick. You can't forbid people from seeing their old mothers and fathers, or even holding a funeral for them, that is really criminal. Ursula Von der Leyen, head of the EU, also expects that: ""elderly people in care homes cannot be visited as long as there is no vaccine. I know that's difficult, but it's about human lives”, she said. “We have to be disciplined and be very patient"". ""We will have to live with the virus for months, probably until next year."" So many elderly and sick will die without saying goodbye to their beloved ones for almost a year? How cruel. Also, she dictates that we are not allowed to book a trip or holiday, meaning we have to wait for vaccinations and forcibly be vaccinated, also a violation of human rights and freedom. This is especially so when scientists say that younger people are not dying, and weren’t we told ten or twenty years ago that the best way to catch a cold so that we get a better immune system? All of that is thrown out, and according to the EU (German- and French-dominated), our lives will never be the same after COVID-19, how frightening! China is partly back to normal, so why drive people to suicide or hunt them like criminals? Because it’s not about the virus anymore, but about power.

The New Normal

Ready for the one and a half meter society? ""We will have to look for the new normal in the one and a half meter society,"" Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the head of the EU, and Bundespresident Steinmeier of Germany declared, independent from each other, but on the same time on their national TV stations. “We are still in the middle of the corona crisis, although the number of new deaths and registered infections is leveling off”. “We can get a normal summer out of our minds, because measures will remain in force even after April 28"", they declared as well, meaning lockdown until at least September, or if and when there is a vaccination. Is this democracy? These are the signs of a totalitarian EU body which wants to control the lives of people from birth to death, where they control even our deaths, without proper funerals and loved ones. These are statements not to be made by so-called “democratic” countries, their rhetoric is an Orwellian message to us, the “free” citizens of Europe.

Eurobonds

A solidarity fund to ensure that the poorest countries in the EU, like Italy, Spain and Greece -- the countries who, by the way, have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 crisis and have their countries full of migrants and migrant workers toiling for the rich German supermarkets --pay low interest on their bonds has been taken off the table. Ironically, the richest countries, the Netherlands and Germany, voted against it, while France is silent on this matter. How dare they speak about solidarity, it’s people who are dying, not the Italian government, the people in the streets of Naples, Sicily, and small towns in southern Italy are not dying from COVID-19 but from hunger and suicide. They ask us, the citizens of the EU, to show solidarity, but we can’t because the EU is not for us since it only show ssolidarity with money for themselves and not for us. We are heading towards the suppression and loss of our freedom, a virus was needed and we gave up all our human rights, but this whole process started already in 2015 during the illegal wars in the Middle East.",1,

Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Highlights Fourth Quarter 2019 Operating Highlights Dr. Yan Li, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented: â€œWe delivered a solid revenue growth and improved gross margin.  The Company continued to operate profitably.  Our revenue growth rate was 25.4%, well ahead of our initial guidance.  We are pleased to see the continued strong demand of our products.  We achieved a historically high gross margin at 26.1%, benefiting from the higher sales price, better product mix and continued cost cutting efforts.  In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affected our sales and operation.  We have taken proactively measures to mitigate the impact.  We are pleased to see the positive trend in the past few weeks.â€ Dr. Li continued, â€œIn December 2019, our new manufacturing facility at Changzhou commenced operation.  The new facility covers about 75 acres and has a designed capacity of 700,000 units per annum.  We are very excited about the growth perspective of our business and are committed to expand our production capacity to meet the increasing demand.  In January 2020, we attended the Consumer Electronics Show in the U.S. and launched two new products, the RQi-GT, an urban performance electric motorcycle, and the TQi-GT, our first electric three-wheeler.  We are very excited about the enriched product portfolio and look forward to the sustaining growth of our business.â€ Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Results Revenues were RMB 536.1 million, an increase of 25.4% year over year, due to increased sales volume of 13.5% and increased revenues per e-scooter of 10.5%. Cost of revenues were RMB 395.9 million, an increase of 7.0% year over year, mainly due to higher e-scooter sales volume.  The cost per e-scooter, defined as cost of revenues divided by the number of e-scooters sold in a specified period, was RMB 3,726, down 5.7% from RMB 3,952 in the fourth quarter 2018 as a result of lower raw material cost and change in product mix. Gross margin was 26.1%, up substantially from 13.5% in the same period of 2018, mainly due to lower raw material costs, higher sales price and a greater proportion of revenue from accessories and spare parts. Operating expenses were RMB 94.2 million, an increase of 3.6% from the same period of 2018. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was 17.6%, compared with 21.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Operating expenses excluding share-based compensation were RMB 86.5 million, increased by 30.8% year over year, and represented 16.1% of revenues, compared with 15.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Government grants were RMB 13.5 million, increased by 13.4 million from the same period of 2018, mainly consisting of various incentives from local government authorities. Share-based compensation was RMB 7.8 million, a decrease of RMB 17.0 million from RMB 24.8 million in the same period of last year.  The decline was mainly due to the accelerated vesting of certain restricted ordinary shares in the fourth quarter 2018. Net income was RMB 60.7 million, an improvement of RMB 92.7 million compared with a net loss of RMB 32.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The net income margin was 11.3%, compared with a net loss margin of 7.5% in the same period of 2018. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was RMB 68.5 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of RMB 7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The adjusted net income margin2 was 12.8%, compared with an adjusted net loss margin of 1.7% in the same period of 2018. Basic and diluted net income per ADS were RMB 0.81 (US$ 0.12) and RMB 0.79 (US$ 0.11) respectively. Full Year 2019 Financial Results Net revenues were RMB 2,076.3 million, an increase of 40.5%, mainly driven by increases in e-scooter sales volume of 24.1% and net revenues per e-scooter of 13.2%.  China represented 85.1% of net revenues from e-scooter sales, and overseas markets represented 14.9%. Cost of revenues were RMB 1,589.7 million, an increase of 24.3%, mainly driven by higher e-scooter sales volume.  The cost per e-scooter, defined as cost of revenues divided by the number of e-scooters sold in a specified period, was RMB 3,773, slightly higher than RMB 3,767 in 2018. Gross margin was 23.4%, increased substantially from 13.4% in 2018, mainly driven by lower raw material cost, higher sales price, and change in product mix. Operating expenses were RMB 329.7 million, a decrease of 35.9% from RMB 514.4 million in 2018.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues was 15.9%, compared with 34.8% in 2018. Operating expenses excluding share-based compensation were RMB 310.3 million, an increase of 24.7%, and represented 14.9% of net revenues, compared with 16.8% in 2018. Government grants were RMB 29.8 million, increased by 28.4 million compared with the year of 2018, mainly consisting of various incentives from local government authorities. Share-based compensation was RMB 19.6 million, a decrease of RMB 246.3 million from RMB 265.9 million in 2018.  The decrease was mainly because of the higher expenses that arose from the accelerated vesting of certain restricted ordinary shares during 2018 and the transfer of a number of ordinary shares from a shareholder to one of our vice presidents for nil consideration in June 2018. Net income was RMB 190.1 million, an increase of RMB 539.1 million from a net loss of RMB 349.0 million in 2018.  The increase was mainly caused by the increased revenues, higher gross margin and lower share-based compensation expenses as described above. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was RMB 209.7 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of RMB 48.7 million in 2018.  The adjusted net income margin was 10.1% in 2019, compared with an adjusted net loss margin of 3.3% in 2018. Basic and diluted net income per ADS were RMB 2.55 (US$ 0.37) and RMB 2.48 (US$ 0.36) respectively. Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash, term deposits and short-term investments of RMB 764.8 million in aggregate.  The Company had restricted cash of RMB 221.7 million and short-term bank borrowings of RMB 217.4 million. Business Outlook NIU expects revenues of the first quarter 2020 to be in the range of RMB 195 million to RMB 265 million, representing a year-over-year decrease of 45% to 25%, which was due to the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on Companyâ€™s sales and operation. The above outlook is based on information available as of the date of this press release and reflects the Companyâ€™s current and preliminary expectation, which is subject to change in light of uncertainties and situations related to how COVID-19 develops.

112,"NY Gov. Cuomo Rejected Buying Recommended 16,000 Ventilators in 2015 for Pandemic, Established Death Panels and Lottery Instead",Kristinn Taylor,"Life comes at you fast, as the saying goes, or as the case may be in this era of a viral pandemic, death comes at you fast. Sadly it is the latter for the citizens of New York who will pay the price for Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) 2015 decision to not fix a shortfall and buy the recommended 16,000 ventilators to shore up the state’s stockpile in case of a pandemic. Cuomo spent more money than the cost of the ventilators on a solar panel boondoggle, reports former New York LieuteAnonymoust Governor Betsy McCaughey (R) in a syndicated column published this past week. McCaughey reports the Cuomo administration decided instead to establish “triage officers” to decide in a crisis who would get a ventilator and who would be left to die. It has also been reported a ventilator lottery would be an option in a pandemic crisis. Now with the COVID-19 Chinese coronavirus overwhelming New York hospitals, Cuomo is begging for ventilators. NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo gestures toward a hospital ventilator during an interview with CNN New Day co-host Alisyn Camerota, March 19, screen image.
…After learning that the state’s stockpile of medical equipment had 16,000 fewer ventilators than New Yorkers would need in a severe pandemic, Gov. Andrew Cuomo came to a fork in the road in 2015. He could have chosen to buy more ventilators. Instead, he asked his health commissioner, Howard Zucker to assemble a task force and draft rules for rationing the ventilators they already had.
That task force came up with rules that will be imposed when ventilators run short. Patients assigned a red code will have the highest access, and other patients will be assigned green, yellow or blue (the worst) depending on a “triage officer’s” decision. In truth, a death officer. Let’s not sugarcoat it. It won’t be up to your own doctor.
Cuomo could have purchased the additional 16,000 needed ventilators for $36,000 apiece or a total of $576 million in 2015. It’s a lot of money but less than the $750 million he threw away on a boondoggle “Buffalo Billion” solar panel factory. When it comes to state budget priorities, spending half a percent of the budget on ventilators is a no brainer.
Now the pandemic is actually here. Cuomo’s grim reaper rules will be applied. New York City’s deputy commissioner for disease control Demetre Daskalakis is anticipating “some very serious difficult decisions.” So far, in New York City, 1 out of every 4 people with a confirmed case has been hospitalized, and 44% of them have needed a ventilator. The task force claimed there was no point in buying ventilators because there’s also a shortage of doctors and nurses trained to use them. Five years ago, that problem could have been fixed, too. Even now, the National Disaster Medical System can send staff to hot spots like New York…
End excerpt. Please read the entire Betsy McCaughey article at this link.
Before the virus hit the state, the New York Times reported on February 27 about the shortage of ventilators and the rationing plans that include a lottery system.
Across New York, there were 7,241 ventilators in acute care settings, and another 1,750 stockpiled for use in an emergency, according to a 2015 state report. The report noted that the supply of ventilators would be inadequate for a pandemic on the scale of the 1918 flu outbreak.
The task force that issued the report devised a formula, relying partially on medical criteria, to help hospitals decide who would get ventilators and who would not. It also envisioned a lottery system in some instances. And age could play a role, with children being given preference over adults.
On March 19 Cuomo appeared on CNN’s New Day. Gov. Cuomo’s webpage with the transcript of the interview leads with this quote in large font.
Governor Cuomo: “Do we have enough beds, do we have enough gloves, enough PPE equipment? There is something called the Federal Defense Procurement Act. This is a war. Treat it like a war. Say to the manufacturers in this country, I need you to build these pieces of equipment quickly, certainly the gear, the machine next to me, the ventilator, this is going to be the matter of life and death for people. We now have about 5,000, 6,000 ventilators in New York State. We are going to need about 30,000 ventilators because these people who have come in all have respiratory illnesses.”
Cuomo: “That’s the war time mentality. You can’t buy a ventilator right now. Globally, you can’t buy them. We’re going to have to make them or make something like them. And that’s why the federal government is stepping up and ordering the manufacturers to now come together and make this happen is going to be imperative.” ",1,
521,The best VR movies from Tribecaâ€™s Short Film Festival for Oculus Quest and Go,"Jamie Feltham, Upload VR","If youâ€™ve ever dreamed of attending a prestigious film festival, nowâ€™s your chance. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the VR portion of the annual Tribeca Film Festival is moving online this weekend. If you have an Oculus Quest or Oculus Go (sorry, Rift owners), you can watch this yearâ€™s Cinema360 lineup, a collection of 15 short films curated into four playlists, through April 26. Itâ€™s a shrewd move in the face of the current climate that, beyond keeping people safe, removes much of the unnecessary exclusivity that surrounds festivals. And itâ€™s something you should definitely check out. This collection of films suggests that VR filmmakers are still getting to grips with the platform; thereâ€™s still a strange discomfort to watching 3D video without being able to move your head, or fighting off blur. But as usual thereâ€™s a suite of fresh ideas, new perspectives, and inventive storytelling. We rounded up each below.   Focused on fantastical experiences and real-life adventures, this offers a selection of dream-like films, often masking more troubling undertones. Rain Fruits is a brilliant, tough story of a boy from Myanmar migrating from his lucid home, where rain forms what he affectionately calls rain fruits, to the unforgiving streets of South Korea. Though deeply concerning both as a story and a microcosm for a wider situation faced all over the globe, the piece finds poetry in its profound narration and beauty in its rain-dusted visual style. Dear Lizzy is a Yellow Submarine-style half-music video animation that mines gold from its acidic visuals, set to the backdrop of a girl reading a letter to a missing friend. Less arresting is 1st Steps, an earnest attempt to document manâ€™s mission to the moon in VR that rarely feels like it knows what itâ€™s doing with the platform. It frantically zigs and zags from one style of shot to another, barely giving you a chance to gather your bearings, providing a sensation perhaps akin to the disorientation of space itself. Nevertheless, itâ€™s chock full of amazing imagery and atmosphere. Forgotten Kiss is a pleasant, if inessential, pantomime of a piece retelling a Russian fairy tale. Best film: Rain Fruits  As its name implies, Seventeen Plus moves on to more mature themes, and it sets out to prove it straight away with the fantastic A Safe Guide To Dying, a fresh dystopian story of VRâ€™s chilling possibilities, fully integrated with the platform and fighting its way to a more hopeful outlook on life. Black Bag follows on in tone with a darkly unsettling piece about the fetishization of high octane action as a supplement for the mundanity of life. Itâ€™s abstract, perhaps a little too much so, but makes a mark with some searing imagery and ambiguity. The Pantheon of Queer Mythology is a pretty eye-opening envisioning of Deities as bastions of queer representation that begs for multiple viewings to decipher its imagery and narration. Finally, Saturnism is a brilliantly amusing expansion of Francisco Goyaâ€™s â€œSaturn Devouring His Son,â€ which puts you in the unfortunate position of the latter character in the painting. Itâ€™s silly, but well done and uniquely able to put a smile on your face in the midst of being eaten by a giant. Best film: A Safe Guide To Dying  Focused on home and family, Kinfolk holds some of the selectionâ€™s most warming and memorable films. Ferenja tells the story of a young girl coming to terms with her mixed-race upbringing, finding herself struggling on both sides. The piece is informative and culturally rich, adding a balanced voice to the topic of identity in 2020.The Inhabited House ingeniously invites you into the directorâ€™s grandparentâ€™s house, then maps old family videos to their locations in the room, effectively bringing memories to life. Itâ€™s a novel idea that Iâ€™d love to be explored in deeper context. But itâ€™s Home that steals the show here, depicting a beautifully staged family reunion at a Taiwanese grandmotherâ€™s home, casting viewers as the owner. Thereâ€™s real family chemistry to the party, offering a rare glimpse into another way of life that seems truly authentic and caring. Best film: Home  The final playlist might not have much connective tissue, but itâ€™s a chance for the selection to have a little more fun, like with Lutaw, a Pixar-esque short animation the shines a spotlight on the work of Yellow Boat of Hope, a charity that provides transport to schools between islands in the Philippines where, amazingly, some students had been swimming to school. Attack on Daddy is a decidedly more ludicrous bit of playtime in which a father and his daughter find themselves trapped in a Wendy house. Itâ€™s cheesy and, frankly, a little student film-level, but an amusing concept nonetheless. Elsewhere, Upstander is a short, sweet message of sticking up for people. Spinning out of Oculusâ€™ VR for Good program, the piece presents a fairly routine look at bullying thatâ€™s strengthened by a powerful ending message.  Finally, Tale of the Tibetan Nomad offers an engaging look into Tibetan folklore. Best film: Lutaw This story originally appeared on Uploadvr.com. Copyright 2020",0,
238,French researcher Dr. Didier Raoult has now treated 1000 coronavirus patient with 99.3% success rate [Update],TechStartups Team,"We first wrote about renowned Dr. Didier Raoult after he and his team of French researchers conducted a study which showed that 100% of coronavirus patients that received a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment.
In a follow-up study, which has a larger sample size of 80 COVID-19 patients, the team found a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74-year old patient still in intensive care unit. The team also found that, by administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, they were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible, according to a new paper published today in IHU Méditerranée Infection.
We now have new updates. Tonight, Dr. Oz said during an interview that Dr. Raoult is about to publish the results of his new study. Dr. OZ announced that Dr. Didier Raoult has now treated 1000 coronavirus patient with 99.3% success rate. Of the 1000 patients treatments, 20 patients went to the ICU and 7 patients died. Dr. Raoult said the side effects were trivial things like rash etc.",1,
285,VW ditches outlook after COVID-19 hammers first-quarter profit - Reuters,,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germanyâ€™s Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE) withdrew its outlook for 2020 on Thursday due to uncertainty related to the new coronavirus outbreak which caused operating profit to drop 81% in the first quarter. The carmaker, like others in the sector, halted production at some sites last month as governments around the world imposed lockdowns on their populations to stem the spread of the virus. The measures to contain the movement of people have impacted car sales and profit in the first quarter, the carmaker said. Operating profit fell to 0.9 billion euros ($979.7 million), which would be an 81% drop from 4.84 billion last year, and the groupâ€™s return on sales margin is expected to be around 1.6%, down from 8.1% in the first quarter of 2019. The full year outlook â€œcan no longer be achievedâ€, Volkswagen said. In February Volkswagen had said it aimed to achieve customer deliveries in line with the previous year, revenue growth of 4% in 2020 and slightly higher passenger car deliveries. In its passenger cars unit, Volkswagen Group had predicted an operating return on sales between 6.5%-7.5% in 2020 and an operating return on sales of 4%-5% in its commercial vehicles unit. Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the family-controlled holding company which owns a majority stake in Volkswagen Group, also withdrew its forecast for 2020 due to the earnings situation at Volkswagen Group. VW said negative fair value impacts from commodity derivatives and currency effects hit the first quarter 2020 result by 1.3 billion euros. The company now expects first quarter revenue of 55 billion euros, down 8% from 60.01 billion euros in the year-earlier period. Its automotive business had a negative cash flow of 2.5 billion euros, due to higher inventories and a reduction in its liabilities, VW said. VWâ€™s luxury arm Audi said measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic had led retail sales to come to a near standstill. Sales revenue in the first quarter was 12.5 billion euros, down from 13.8 billion euros in the year-earlier period. Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Skoda and Porsche, is due to publish full first quarter results on April 29, 2020.

453,"Even mask-wearers can be ID'd, China facial recognition firm says - Reuters",Martin Pollard,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese company says it has developed the countryâ€™s first facial recognition technology that can identify people when they are wearing a mask, as most are these days because of the coronavirus, and help in the fight against the disease. China employs some of the worldâ€™s most sophisticated systems of electronic surveillance, including facial recognition. But the coronavirus, which emerged in Hubei province late last year, has resulted in almost everyone wearing a surgical mask outdoors in the hope of warding off the virus - posing a particular problem for surveillance. Now Hanwang Technology Ltd, which also goes by the English name Hanvon, said it has come up technology that can successfully recognize people even when they are wearing masks. â€œIf connected to a temperature sensor, it can measure body temperature while identifying the personâ€™s name, and then the system would process the result, say, if it detects a temperature over 38 degrees,â€ Hanwang Vice President Huang Lei told Reuters in an interview. The Beijing-based firm said a team of 20 staff used core technology developed over the past 10 years, a sample database of about 6 million unmasked faces and a much smaller database of masked faces, to develop the technology, The team began work on the system in January, as the coronavirus outbreak gathered pace, and began rolling it out to the market after just a month. It sells two main types of products that use the technology. One performs â€œsingle channelâ€ recognition that is best used at, for example, entrances to office buildings. The other, more powerful, product is a â€œmulti-channelâ€ recognition system that uses â€œmultiple surveillance camerasâ€. It can identify everyone in a crowd of up to 30 people â€œwithin a secondâ€, Huang says. â€œWhen wearing a mask, the recognition rate can reach about 95%, which can ensure that most people can be identified,â€ Huang said, adding the success rate for people without mask is about 99.5%. A big customer, not surprisingly, is the Ministry of Public Security, which runs the police. Using Hanwangâ€™s technology, the ministry can cross-reference images with its own database of names and other information and then identify and track people as they move about, Huang said. â€œIt can detect crime suspects, terrorists or make reports or warnings,â€ he said. But the system struggles to identify people with both a mask and sunglasses, he said. â€œIn this situation, all of the key facial information is lost. In such cases recognition is tough,â€ Huang said. The company has about 200 clients in Beijing using the technology, including the police, and expect scores more across 20 provinces to start installing it soon, Huang said. It is not immediately clear how Chinese citizens are reacting to this new technology. When it comes to other surveillance tools being used in the fight against the coronavirus, there has been some grumbling on social media but most people seem to be accepting extra intrusion, or even embracing it, as a means to deal with the health emergency. Although domestic customers have been driving Hanwangâ€™s business, Huang also said he expected more foreign interest, as the virus spreads around the world and more people wear face masks. â€œIt not only benefits Chinese people, but also, when the technology is applied globally, it can benefit the world,â€ he said.

52,China is Confronting the COVID-19 Epidemic. Was It Man-Made? An Act of of Bio-warfare?,John P.A. Ioannidis,"The new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, also called COVID19, has as of this date killed about 3,000 people and infected some 87,000 around the globe, the vast majority of them in China. The virus has spread to at least 56 countries. The new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, also called COVID-19, has as of this date resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people Worldwide, the vast majority of them in China. The epidemic is largely confined to Mainland China. While the virus has spread to at least 56  countries according to the WHO, the numbers of confirmed cases are low: 4691 confirmed  cases outside Mainland China. What the western media fails to address is that there is the possibility that the virus could have been “man-made” in one or more of the numerous US bio-warfare laboratories. Western media also are silent about the fact that the virus appears to be largely affecting ethnic Chinese, meaning, it targets specifically Chinese DNA. Almost all of the deaths and confirmed cases in the 51 countries and territories to which the virus has spread, are of Chinese origin. The virus appears to be strengthening, as it mutates over time, making its control even more difficult. Will it eventually break the “Chinese DNA boundaries” and affect also other DNA types, i.e. western “Caucasian” people. But the west also expects Chinese scientists and bio-researchers to overcome the epidemic and stop the virus from further mutating, therefore reducing the western infection risk. Despite early hopes that a vaccine may be found soon – until now there has been little progress in this direction. However, Cuba’s antiviral RecombiAnonymoust Interferon Alpha 2B (IFNrec) was chosen by Chinese medical and bio-researchers to combat the coronavirus. Interestingly, Interferon had been discovered in Cuba 39 years ago, at the very onset of Cuba’s biotechnology programme in 1981. But it is not widely used in the world, even though it could save countless lives and cure countless patients (mainly diabetics), simply because of the US boycott that does not allow marketing of medication Made in Cuba. Nevertheless, the COVID19 infection rate seems to have been gradually declining in the last three weeks. And there is no doubt that China will overcome this epidemic. Yet, the world must wake up to the fact that this could be an act of biological warfare. In the last two years, since 2018 alone, China was hit by several types of bird flu (H7N4 and H7N9) in 2018 and yet another strain just in January 2020 which was overshadowed by the more serious COVID-2019.

There was also an outbreak of the African swine Flu (2018), killing millions of pigs. And there was a massive food crop destruction (2019 – mostly corn and soybeans) by the so-called “armyworms”.

Compensating for the impacts on the supply of pork, corn and soybean, China resorted to importing theses commodities– and most of the imports came from the US.

Were these ‘outbreaks’ which  had destructive impacts on China’s economy coincidental? They have created instability, food price inflation and a dependence on imported agricultural products from the US.

The western media has been playing up the so-called Trump tariff war with China, while hidden from the limelight and in parallel, more serious warfare – bio-warfare – was going on.

In fact, little is known in the west about these previous biological attacks by the US-led west, aiming at damaging massively China’s economy – as well as heightening China’s dependence on imports from the US; in addition to damaging China morally, thereby, they, the west, believe (wrongly), weakening the level of resistance. A real war with bombs and guns, maybe nuclear, aiming at total destruction, cannot be ruled out.

Let’s remember the Big Picture – namely that this is in whatever way you want to turn it, a bio-war against China, and perhaps the first step of an all-out war against China’s rising economic power, and foremost against China’s solid currency, the yuan which may soon take over as the world’s chief reserve currency.

This would mean the fall of the US-dollar hegemony, the only force that keeps the empire alive and kicking, other than its military strength which is non-sustainable, as it aims only at destruction abroad – but leaving behind a rapidly faltering economy at home. Precisely the same pattern brought down the Roman Empire some 2000 years ago. There are too many “coincidences” to conclude that this strengthened coronavirus – considerably stronger than SARS, the one of the 2002 / 2003 epidemic – ‘escaped’ a Wuhan lab by accident, or as the west would like to present it: by negligence. Circumstantial gut-feeling tells me, this is not a series of three coincidences. This could be (yet to be confirmed) a maliciously planned disaster.

Is this a sinister plan (coupled with media propaganda) carried out by a western elite to attack China’s rapidly growing economy, outpacing that of the United States?

Is it an attack on the Yuan which is also gradually replacing the US dollar as a world reserve currency?

When that happens the US-empire which essentially relies on dollarization is doomed. The build-up to more harm and destruction, possibly a hot war? In late January,  the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Director General (DG) said that the new coronavirus, COVID-19, also called 2019-nCoV, was not a pandemic. On January 30, probably on instructions from Washington, he declared the outbreak of a Global Emergency, but added on his own initiative that there were no reasons for countries to ban travel of their citizens to China. In contradiction to WHO’s recommendation, Washington immediately issued a travel warning for US citizens not to travel to China. Many other countries followed their master, especially Europeans. These US-led western efforts to weaken China’s economy are also meant to send a discouraging message to all those countries that are planning to divest their reserves and international payment methods away from the US-dollar. The west will not succeed.

Even with the massive damage caused by the recent coronavirus, China’s economy is steadier and stronger than that of most western countries, especially the US.

China’s non-confrontational approach to resolve these social – health – and economic issues, will help China to overcome and isolate her aggressive adversaries. That’s part of the 5000-year old Tao philosophy.

As the US is increasing her aggressive stance against China (and Russia) – Washington appears and acts more and more like a dying beast, lashing out around itself, trying to bringing down and destroying as much as possible, while steadily digging itself deeper into its own (economic) grave.

Sanctions left and right and bio-wars on China – threatening China by surrounding her with some 400 military bases and nuke-equipped warships and planes, will not create more confidence in the US, rather the contrary. Countries and people realize that being aligned and allied with the US of A, is dangerous, can be deadly. So, they are driven away and towards the east, rather than being attracted by the western sinking ship. Amazingly, western aggressions will falter confronting China’s robust social and economic system, and more so, China’s peaceful plan to connect and build bridges between the world’s people, nations and cultures, through the socioeconomic development scheme of the 21st Century spanning the globe – the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also called the New Silk Road. A way Towards a Shared Future for Mankind.",1,
339,Weâ€™re Testing the Wrong People - The Atlantic,"Ezekiel J. Emanuel, Paul M. Romer","Even as Donald Trump has delineated his plan to relax social distancing, the United States remains very much in the dark about who has the coronavirus and who does not. We have a shortage of COVID-19 tests, and we simultaneously have the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Consequently, not every American who wants a test can get one. Not every health-care worker can get one. Not even every patient entering a hospital can get one. Because of the shortages, we are rationing tests, and medical facilities and public-health officials are prioritizing the sickest patients for them. If the goal is to restart the American economy, the United States isnâ€™t performing anywhere near enough tests. Worse still, we are testing the wrong people. To safely reopen closed businesses and revive American social life, we need to perform many more testsâ€”and focus them on the people most likely to spread COVID-19, not sick patients. Read: The dangerous delays in U.S. coronavirus testing havenâ€™t stopped COVID-19 testing has been an unmitigated failure in this country. This month, according to the COVID Tracking Project, a data initiative launched by The Atlantic in March, the number of tests performed in the United States has plateaued at about 130,000 to 160,000 a day. Rather than growing rapidlyâ€”as all experts think is absolutely necessaryâ€”the daily number of tests administered in some jurisdictions has even decreased. In New York, for instance, 10,241 tests were performed on April 6, but supply limits forced a huge drop a few days later to 25 total tests. Quest Diagnostics, one of the two biggest firms that run tests, just furloughed 9 percent of its workforce. In addition, news reports suggest that, as of last week, 90 percent of the 15-minute tests developed by Abbott Laboratories are idle due to a lack of necessary reagents and qualified personnel. Testing bottlenecks such as these are major obstacles to getting Americans out of their homes and back on the job.",0,

404,Coronavirus and paracetamol: Can you take paracetamol for coronavirus? | Express.co.uk,Georgina Laud," Coronavirus cases are growing daily, and in the UK now unprecedented measures are in place to prevent further spread of the virus. Britons are being advised to undertake social distancing; avoiding social situations, large gatherings and unnecessary travel. Across the UK, there are 3,269 cases of coronavirus - official name COVID-19 - and 144 people have died from the virus. To safeguard vulnerable groups, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on the UK to work from home where possible, practice social distancing and self-isolate if any member of the household displays symptoms. Coronavirus causes a dry cough, shortness of breath and fever - however, some people can have worse symptoms than others. In extreme cases, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia and even organ failure. For the lesser symptoms - coughing and fever - the Government ask sufferers to remain at home, and not seek advice unless your condition worsens. However, if you feel yourself getting worse, then contact NHS 111. Read More: National Rail will reduce services NEXT WEEK amid coronavirus  For those managing their symptoms at home, the NHS advises to ""drink plenty of water and take everyday painkillers, such as paracetamol to help with your symptoms."" Paracetamol is used to relieve pain and reduce fever, so can help alleviate some symptoms. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance suggested on Tuesday people should not take ibuprofen. French health minister Olivier Veran has suggested anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen the infection. Sir Patrick told MPs: ""The ibuprofen example - it may or may not be right, I don't know, but the sensible thing to do would be to say don't take it at the moment, take something else - paracetamol or something."" As yet there is no cure for coronavirus, only managing the symptoms which arise.

Due to increased demand, the NHS advises only calling 111 if you cannot receive help online. Do not attend a hospital, GP surgery or walk-in-centre as this may spread the virus further. If you want further advice on managing symptoms check the NHS website here.   As yet there is no vaccine for coronavirus, however, UK scientists are working on a coronavirus vaccine aimed at preventing outbreaks similar to the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers from the University of Plymouth have made progress in developing vaccines designed to prevent infections from jumping from animals to humans. Researchers at The Vaccine Group (TVG), a university spinout company, are now looking to create a vaccine to prevent future human coronaviruses which have spread from animals. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, which means they are carried in animals and can transfer across to humans. Dr Michael Jarvis, TVG's chief scientific officer, said: ""As COVID-19 has shown, the spillover of disease from animals to humans can have a very high social, economic and commercial cost globally. ""Naturally, there has been a swift move into funding the development of human vaccines and therapeutics, but to date, we are not aware of any approaches to eliminate COVID-19 in the animal population to prevent future outbreaks or re-emergence of the disease."" He added the animal species involved in the recent emergence remains unclear, and a vaccine like this may be vital for control of COVID-19 as well as other emerging coronaviruses.

461,Schools lockdown: Will schools close tomorrow? Are schools closed from next week?  | UK | News | Express.co.uk,Liam Doyle," School lockdown was a measure toyed by the Prime Minister this week as he met with COBRA to decide the country's next step in tackling the deadly COVID-19 outbreak, one already adopted by other countries and considered vital to keep the infection from its dealy track across the UK. However, the Prime Minister has not followed expert advice in closing down schools and limiting public contact, a decision he may need to make a U-turn on. The PM outlined new advice in a press conference this afternoon. He said schools should only close if there are confirmed cases - saying shutting up schools could do more harm then good. ""We are not, repeat not, closing schools now,"" he said. ""The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time but of course we are keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads."" He did add, however, that this could change as the virus progresses. Speaking to the nation, he also issued a raft of new advice - including that those with mild coronavirus symptoms should self-isolate for seven days at least and that international school trips should be cancelled.   ""If you have coronavirus symptoms however mild, either a new continuous cough or a high temperature, then you should stay at home for at least seven days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease,"" he said. ""We advise all those over 70 with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips."" The PM said the banning of major events such as sporting fixtures is being considered to alleviate the strain on public services. Public Health England has also released new stay-at-home guidance for those with confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus. The advice states not to go to work, school, or public areas, use public transport or taxis - or even go for a walk. The news comes as teachers say they have been asked to prepare home learning packs for students, anticipating up to a month of closures for some schools.    One teacher told the Mirror: â€œWe have had guidance from our head of the academy who has been told to expect at least a week-long closure, possibly two."" â€œIf schools are closed from mid-March, it wouldnâ€™t make sense to open them up again so close to Easter. ""Weâ€™re preparing for a month at home. â€œThe home-learning packs have to be all ready by this Friday, with the aim of sending them home with the kids the following Friday.â€ Another added: â€œWe have been told an extended Easter break is a very real possibility if the virus spread continues at the predicted rate. â€œWe are now preparing for that eventuality. But this will not mean two weeksâ€™ extra holiday. â€œSchools in our local authority area - both primary and secondary â€“ are drawing up plans for children to be given lessons at home.""

What Trump ban means - EXPLAINERTrump travel ban MAPPED: Which countries are banned from travelling? - MAPCoronavirus UK LIVE: Boris Johnson holds emergency meeting - LIVE BLOG  The next point of Boris Johnson's four step plan could see the government consider nationwide school closures to contain the virus alongside a swathe of other new rules. New measures would mirror those introduced in other countries, including a ban on large public gatherings, social distancing and working from home. They would protect the ""most vulnerable"" people, including the elderly and those with other chronic illnesses such as diabetes or coronary heart disease. The government's plan states: â€œWe would consider such measures in order to protect vulnerable individuals with underlying illnesses and thus at greater more at risk of becoming seriously affected by the disease."" ""The effectiveness of these actions will need to be balanced against their impact on society.â€ Andrew Freedman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University, said he was no-longer optimistic containment was possible. The government's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said in a worst-case scenario, COVID-19 could infect 80 percent of people in the UK. He said: â€œAt one stage I was quite optimistic that we might be able to contain it and we wouldn't have a big problem, but that's looking less likely now.â€  Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said the UKâ€™s measures donâ€™t reflect other countries as they are country-appropriate. He added the government should not feel pressured by the decisions made elsewhere. Dr Neal said: â€œDifferent countries are at different stages of the epidemic so what one country should do will not apply to others, we need to be guided by the local epidemiology and the science. ""The UK should adopt UK-appropriate measures and not give in to the demand for something to be done otherwise this will result in inappropriate actions at the wrong time.""

405,"UPDATE 1-Centrica, Barclays weigh on FTSE 100; virus fears persist",,"* FTSE 100 down 0.9%, FTSE 250 down 0.3% * Centrica, Barclays drag on main index * Number of coronavirus cases in China rises * NMC dives after SocGen double downgrade (Adds news items, analyst comments, updates share prices) Feb 13 (Reuters) - London's blue-chip index was dragged lower on Thursday by steep falls in heavyweights Barclays and Centrica, while a rise in new coronavirus cases in China jolted risk sentiment. British utility Centrica skidded 15% to a three-month low after its 2019 profit slumped by more than a third, leading the FTSE 100 to shed 0.9% after two successive days of gains. Barclays was a major drag on the bourse as the bank slipped 2.7%. Britain's financial regulators were probing historical links between its chief executive officer and U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, which overshadowed financial results. The mid-cap FSTE 250 lost 0.3%, tracking a broader risk-off sentiment as the Chinese province of Hubei, an epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, reported a record rise in deaths and thousands of more cases. The increase in numbers, which came after China introduced a new diagnostic procedure involving quicker computerised tomography (CT) scans to screen patients, dented hopes that the outbreak would soon plateau. After the initial outbreak roiled global markets last month, investors have become more sensitive to the rate of its escalation for hints over further bets. ""The fact the rise is down to a reporting change means so far we've only seen mild losses as investors take stock, but a more cautious approach is warranted,"" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said. By 0843 GMT, all sectors on the FTSE 100 traded in the red, with oil majors Shell and BP among major drags. The index underperformed the broader European benchmark as more of its components are exposed to commodity prices. UAE-based NMC Health, whose shares have swung sharply in recent sessions amid takeover chatter, tumbled 9% after analysts at SocGen slapped the stock with a double rating downgrade. ""We conclude that a board reset and a full audit are needed to restore investor confidence,"" SocGen analysts wrote. Coca Cola HBC outperformed with a 4% gain after it, along with fellow bottler Coca-Cola European Partners, reported a higher annual profit, and forecast faster growth in volume across its segments in 2020. Small-cap drugmaker Indivior tanked almost 19% after it reported a fourth-quarter loss and forecast a further drop in sales this year.

441,Meghan Markle and Harry fans celebrate Archie's FIRST birthday with #ArchieDay fundraiser | Royal | News | Express.co.uk,Emily Ferguson," Meghan Markle and Prince Harry fans launched a social media fundraiser earlier this month to mark baby Archie's first birthday, which will take place on May 6. The campaign, which uses the hashtag ArchieDay, aims to raise funds for charities helping vulnerable children impacted by the coronavirus and the supporters have now added a UK charity close to the couple's hearts. The organisers of the fundraising initiative have now included WellChild to their efforts, to recognise Archie's birthplace. Announcing that the charity had been added to the #ArchieDay campaign, the organisers said: ""We heard all of your suggestions and we agreed that the #ArchieDay fundraising campaign would not be complete without a nod to Archieâ€™s birthplace. His fatherland, the UK."" WellChild, which provides care for children with complex illnesses and young people, is the first British charity to join the campaign and is the only one of the royal couple's patronages to be featured. Other charities aim to help vulnerable children in Canada, America and South Africa - countries the couple are particularly fond of.   When people go to the official Instagram page coordinating the fundraising, they can choose which of the three charities to donate to. Almost Â£23,000 has already been raised for the charities, including Â£1,779 for WellChild. The other charities include, Children's Aid, Boys and Girls Club and Nourish. Nourish is based in South Africa and provides food to children from impoverished families in rural communities. JUST IN: The hardest thing Prince Charles had to cope with during lockdown  Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada and provides children with programmes for physical activity, healthy living, job training and leadership. The final charity, Children's Aid, is based in the US, which helps children living in poverty. Earlier this week Harry held a 30-minute video call from his new home in Los Angeles with the charity, where he chatted with two parents, a specially trained nurse and the head of the charity, Colin Dyer.

Harry praised the families for their fortitude and courage in times of adversity, calling them â€œsuper-familiesâ€. One mother, Leanne Cooper, told the Duke she is very worried for her 13-year-old daughter, who suffers from several complex illnesses, including cerebral palsy. She said: â€œThere is a lot of information out there, but not a lot for vulnerable families and certainly not for children with complex medical needs.  â€œIf weâ€™re in a position where carers canâ€™t come to work because they might be symptomatic, there is no way we would survive when Sophie needs care seven nights a week, seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

65,US Blame Game Twist: Suing China for COVID-19 Outbreaks,Stephen Lendman,"No evidence suggests that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese lab or from bat-eating Chinese people.

Writer Allen Yu explained that no Chinese tradition of bat-eating exists. Videos suggesting otherwise weren’t from Wuhan or elsewhere in China.

Filming was “in Palau or Indonesia, in locales where bats have traditionally been consumed as food,” said Yu, adding:

The bat-eating theory doesn’t hold up. “According to current research, it is not likely that bat (or other) consumption” of wild animals caused COVID-19.

Researcher Larry Romanoff explained that “Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists and pharmacologists have determined that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) almost certainly originated in the US.”

In September 2019, Japanese citizens who never visited China were infected with the novel coronavirus in Hawaii — “long before the outbreak in Wuhan.”

Falsely blaming China for its origination is all about the Trump regime shifting blame for its own wrongdoing and failings onto others.

French virologist/Nobel laureate for Medicine Luc Montagnier said COVID-19 was man-made, not transmitted to humans from bats or other wildlife.

In April, a peer-reviewed study published in the Antiviral Research medical journal revealed unique COVID-19 features that facilitate human-to-human transmission — making the novel coronavirus much more contagious than seasonal flu/influenza.

The study also found no evidence that COVID-19 evolved naturally. Its genetic coding isn’t natural.

Most likely it was engineered with elements from MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) — first reported in 2012, according to the study.

Genomics researcher James Lyons-Weiler explained that “(t)here is no doubt that there is a novel sequence in 2019-nCoV” —the virus causing COVID-19 disease, adding:

“IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378,” indicating human engineering.

Infectious diseases expert Dr. Yuhong Dong explained that “this new coronavirus has unprecedented virologic features that suggest genetic engineering may have been involved in its creation.”

“The virus (has) severe clinical features. Thus it poses a huge threat to humans.”

“It is imperative for scientists, physicians, and people all over the world, including governments and public health authorities, to make every effort to investigate this mysterious and suspicious virus in order to elucidate its origin and to protect the ultimate future of the human race.”

A Lancet report said “recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus” — meaning mutations likely didn’t occur naturally.

Greek scientists found no connection between COVID-19 and viruses occurring naturally, saying:

“(T)he new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus” — meaning it didn’t occur from natural mutations.

China’s Global Times accused the Trump regime of “international hooliganism” by the following tactics: Accusing Beijing of initially “concealing” COVID-19 outbreaks, claiming it let the disease spread and “harm the US and the world.”

Claiming China concealed its “actual number of deaths.”

By its actions, the Trump regime fueled anti-China sentiment and encouraged individual and class-action lawsuits — while diverting attention from its own failings.

On March 13, Thailand Medical News (TMN) news reported that “traditional Chinese medicine concoctions used alone or in conjunction with antiviral protocols (is the) secret to (its success in) controlling…COVID-19 outbreaks.”

A peer-reviewed Lancet study of 102 Chinese COVID-19 infected patients treated by the above protocol showed nearly all recovered.

Another study of 701 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients showed that over 90% were cured, had improved symptoms, or were stable with no further deterioration when treated withe above protocol.

China is in the forefront of combatting COVID-19, the US a laggard for failing to prepare for what its officials knew was possible long in advance of outbreaks, and failing to provide proper help to states, local communities, and ordinary Americans in need.

The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) said “minimal diagnostic” testing for weeks after outbreaks began contributed to their spread, adding:

Faulty test kits produced inconclusive or invalid results, making a bad situation worse.

The proof of the pudding is in the data. The US by far leads the world in COVID-19 outbreaks (around 700,000 through Friday), deaths (about 37,000), and mishandling of the public health crisis.

The true seriousness of the disease will best be known in hindsight.

Calling it a hoax is a disservice to growing numbers of infected Americans and others abroad.

According to CDC data for April 14, more Americans died from COVID-19 infection than any other cause.

The Trump regime’s blame game, falsely accusing China for originating COVID-19, encouraged multiple class action lawsuits in the US.

Through mid-April, numerous suits were filed against China and other targets, seeking trillions of dollars in compensation.

One filed in late March by California property managers and an accounting firm that represent small businesses seeks compensation from China for what it had nothing to do with.

A Florida class action suit representing millions of state residents seeks to cash in the same way.

Freedom Watch head Larry Klayman leads another anti-China class-action suit that falsely accuses Beijing of unleashing a biological weapon on humanity.

Anti-China lawsuits are highly unlikely to be successful. No evidence suggests Beijing’s responsibility for COVID-19 outbreaks.

According to California attorney Kent Schmidt, numerous class-action suits were filed, adding:

“These early filings can be indicative of the liabilities that companies should take into consideration and inform their practices now to avoid getting hit with one of these costly lawsuits.”

A class-action case was filed against Norwegian Cruise Lines. It alleges that the company made “unproven (and) blatantly false” statements regarding COVID-19 in order to entice customers to purchase cruises, thus endangering the lives of both their customers and crew members.”

Other cruise line companies may face similar lawsuits.

A virtual cottage industry of litigation stems from COVID-19 outbreaks.

A Washington state civic organization sued Fox News for claiming that COVID-19 is a hoax.

Stating an opinion, true or false, doesn’t involve legal liability.

New York Sports Clubs was sued for allegedly defrauding members during the shutdown.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals was sued for allegedly claiming it developed a vaccine for COVID-19.

A union representing state employees sued Alaska for subjecting them to health and safety risks from COVID-19 outbreaks.

Use of Zoom communications telecommuting application risks lawsuits for violating privacy protections. At least one class-action lawsuit already was filed against the company.

Tort lawyers in the US and perhaps elsewhere see COVID-19 outbreaks as a chance to cash in big.

A Final Comment

Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced the so-called Justice for Victims of COVID-19 Act to hold China responsible for outbreaks.

The measure would strip Beijing of immunity in US court and permit lawsuits against the state and its authorities.

GOP Senator Tom Cotton and Rep. Dan Crenshaw introduced legislation to let US citizens sue China for “damages” caused by COVID-19.

Given anti-China fervor in the US in more normal times, now bordering on hysteria, the measure will likely become the law of the land.

The so-called Immunities Act protects foreign nations from being sued in US courts — except for China.

Enactment of these measures into law will likely produce a greater divide between both countries, making mutual cooperation all the harder.",1,
256,Tennessee Police Arrest Citizen Who Escaped Forced COVID-19 Detention Camp…,Sundance,"Comrades, some readers might not be aware the Ministry of COVID compliance has set up quarantine camps, detention facilities in various areas.  Formerly free citizens who test positive for COVID-19 are forcibly taken to the quarantine camps and held under guard. Last week one of the non-compliant captives demanded his freedom; he climbed the fence and escaped detention.  After a manhunt in Tennessee the subversive citizen was recaptured, arrested and brought back to the detention facility….  Alarmed yet? As you can see from this example, the Tennessee Ministry of COVID Compliance cares about the health of its compliant citizens.  Authorities empowered by the Ministry will actively hunt down subversive citizens and forcibly detain them in the ongoing effort to build a new society where compliance will always provide the security you seek. If wrong-thoughts or requests for arbitrary freedom continue to be expressed, it may become necessary for the Ministry to take enhanced enforcement action.  Please do not put the Ministry in the position of having to make such decisions. Compliance is in your best interest and re-education facilities are costly to maintain. Relax comrades, the Ministry is sensitive to your previous rights as we initiate our new, safer, society.  The COVID Compliance Ministry appreciates good citizens who voluntarily participate in the rules of our new society. We will continue to reward good citizenship status with enhanced tax credits and social benefits allowing greater access to a safe COVID Compliant Society. A safer society; where the odds will always be in our favor. A rogue citizen could put a compliant society at risk of infection. They may not just carry biologics they could carry a more alarming virus of wrong-thought against the interests of the state. Rogue citizens would be subversive to our new society.

160,Human life must trump economics in a pandemic. THIS is why China is succeeding in war on Covid-19 and US is on path to disaster,John Ross,"China’s outperformance of the US in both the 2008 crisis & the Covid-19 outbreak will see a geopolitical shift in Beijing’s favor. The longer the US continues with its disastrous pandemic response, the greater the shift will be.
The pandemic has a clear global course. Despite the coronavirus outbreak beginning in China, Beijing has brought it rapidly under control – the number of domestically transmitted cases was reduced to virtually zero by the end of March. In the US and Western Europe, on the contrary, the number of cases is rising vertiginously with no peak in sight.

In absolute terms, the number of US and Italian coronavirus cases is already greater than China’s. But comparisons in absolute numbers greatly understate the severity of the coronavirus crisis in the US and Western Europe – due to their populations being far smaller than China. In reality, the relative severity of the US and Western European coronavirus pandemic is already far worse than at the worst point of the crisis in China and is still rising. This disastrous US and Western European failure will be more severe than the international fiAnonymouscial crisis and will have profound geopolitical consequences. What does China’s success mean?
Two key issues immediately follow from China’s success – how did China achieve this, and what is its international impact?

Technically, China’s means of controlling the coronavirus were not unknown – quarantines, deliveries of essentials to homes to allow the population to stay indoors, compulsory mask wearing, testing, transfer of medical personnel to affected areas. China certainly implemented these far more rigorously than the US and Western Europe. But behind that technical difference was a clear understanding of society by China.

The most fundamental issue was that China started from a real understanding of human rights as they affect the real lives of people – not the artificial constructs of Western, purely formal ‘human rights.’ In a lethal epidemic, the key human right is to stay alive. 

More generally, for real human beings, the most fundamental issue in your life is not whether you can use Facebook, or cast a vote for a politician who promises one thing at an election and then does something completely different after it in a system which gives no real control over them, but the real ability to stay alive when faced with a deadly threat, and to have a decent and rising standard of living, to have health care, to have education, and innumerable other real concerns of people.

Within that context, the struggle against the coronavirus was on such a scale that it had to be carried out as a war – in China, it is frequently referred to as a ‘People’s War’ against the virus. This explains China’s measures. Its strategy was strictly logical once this starting point was understood. Above all, it was necessary to do everything possible to confine the virus to Wuhan and Hubei – if it had spread throughout China it would have been impossible to control. Therefore, the first decisive measure was strict travel restrictions.

If people had been allowed to leave Wuhan/Hubei, overwhelming numbers would have fled with the virus spreading uncontrollably throughout China – this is precisely what is occurring in the US or Spain where people fleeing infection centers such as New York or Madrid are spreading the virus.

There is no doubt this caused tremendous suffering in Wuhan/Hubei. By preventing people from leaving, this placed inconceivable pressure on Hubei’s health system. China poured tens of thousands of medical staff into Hubei but this necessarily took time.

It may be compared to one of the greatest battles in Soviet history – Stalingrad. There, it was vitally necessary for the defenders within Stalingrad to tie the German Army down in combat within the city itself while the Soviet Army prepared the encirclement which finally smashed the Nazis to pieces. The result was that Soviet casualties within Stalingrad itself were terrible – the city’s defenders gave their lives to ensure the Soviet people’s decisive victory. In a parallel manner, people in Wuhan gave their lives to protect the people of the whole of China. Hubei and Wuhan’s medical staff are rightly regarded as heroes of the Chinese people.

Once the decisive task of preventing the virus’ spread had been achieved, then China could put pressure on the virus in Hubei and finally Wuhan. I have good friends in Wuhan. I know the people understood this national strategy despite the intense suffering it meant in Wuhan.

Catastrophic failure of ‘human rights’ in the West
But what was the response of the so called ‘human rights’ organizations in the West to this? Total and criminal condemnation of China’s successful strategy!

Kenneth Roth, executive director of ‘Human Rights Watch,’ declared: “In typical Chinese Communist Party fashion, Beijing confines 35 million people rather than pursuing the transparent and targeted approach to the Wuhan coronavirus that public health and human rights require.” The Guardian in Britain published article after article attacking China’s methods of dealing with the virus before finally admitting on March 20, almost two months after China started its decisive actions: “Rigid travel restrictions and social distancing requirements appear to have had their desired effect.” Joshua Wong, a supporter of the Hong Kong rioters, called for the WHO director general’s resignation because the organization supported China’s successful strategy.

By the end of March, most of the world recognized that China had been correct. For example, a recent column on Bloomberg in the US had the self-evident headline: “The rest of the world is falling in step with Beijing’s way of fighting the coronavirus.”  

“Had China not imposed such steps, one simulation suggests there could have been eight million cases by February… In fact, each government seems to be reinventing the wheel, though events eventually force them to take China’s path: closing schools and public places, shutting borders, imposing curfews, inhibiting movement,” the column read.

If the advice of Roth, the Guardian, or Wong had been taken, by now thousands more people, more probably tens of thousands, would be dead.

Failure in US
This wrong approach in the West has now created a disaster in the US and Western Europe. The catastrophic scale of this is simply disguised by making comparisons in terms of absolute numbers between China and individual Western countries. This conceals the fact that the impact of the coronavirus epidemic in Western countries is many times greater than during the worst period in China – because China’s population is far larger than any Western country – more than four times that of the US and 23 times Italy’s.

So, for example, WHO data for March 28 shows the US had 16,894 new daily coronavirus cases – 4.3 times as high as China’s worst daily peak of 3,887. But China’s population is 4.25 times that of the US. So, in proportion to China’s population, the US figures are equal to 71,799 (16,894 x 4.25). The relative intensity of the impact of the coronavirus in the US is therefore already more than 18 times as great as the worst day in China! And the number of daily cases in the US is on a strongly rising upward curve. A literal catastrophe is unfolding in the US. 

To understand the impact of this, US troops abroad have many times suffered severe war casualties – World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq. But only twice in American history have there been mass death events on US soil itself – the Civil War and 1918-19’s Spanish flu epidemic. Unless there is a dramatic, and unlikely, change in US policy within days, there will be the third mass death event in the US. This will necessarily hammer the US economy with a downturn worse than the international fiAnonymouscial crisis. Geopolitical consequences
The geopolitical consequences of this situation are both immediate and long term. In the short term, so far, the coronavirus has only hit three regions with mass force – China, the US, and Western Europe. Countries in other regions will feel its full force in the coming weeks. They can either attempt to follow the successful path of China or they can follow the disastrous one of the US.

Furthermore China, the world’s greatest manufacturer, can be of decisive practical aid to them. Such a simple fact as that France can order one billion facemasks from China shows what is possible. The nonsense of the formal Western concept of human rights will be demonstrated to billions of people. This will inevitably produce a geopolitical shift in China’s favor.

How deep the longer-term geopolitical consequences will be depends on how long the US continues on its present catastrophic course. It is now impossible for the US to avoid a severe recession – certainly the sharpest decline in output since the Great Depression and possibly worse. How quickly the US economy can recover depends on how rapidly it can solve its medical crisis. But to achieve this means, for the reasons already given, the US abandoning its totally false concept of human rights, its subordination of human lives to the economy and, in essence, admitting that China was correct. Such a tremendous shift is unlikely to come nearly fast enough in a pandemic in which literally every day counts.

In the last 12 years, the world has passed through two huge global tests – the international fiAnonymouscial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. In both, China has far outperformed the US. This will necessarily lead to a major shift in geopolitics in favor of China. The longer the US continues with its present disastrous response to the coronavirus, the greater that shift will be.",1,
286,Norman Hunter dead: Leeds and England 1966 World Cup hero dies after coronavirus battle | Football | Sport | Express.co.uk,Bruce Archer,"  Norman Hunter has died of coronavirus aged 76, former club Leeds have confirmed this morning. The club legend and England World Cup hero was battling the virus in hospital. And this morning Leeds have tweeted to confirm his passing, they said: â€œLeeds United are devastated to learn of the passing of club legend Norman Hunter at the age of 76.â€ Hunter played over 700 games for Leeds during a 13-year spell, helping them win the First Division twice in 1969 and 1974 under Don Revie. He was also part of Englandâ€™s World Cup winning squad in 1966, but didn't play, although he was given a medal in 2007. The former defender was diagnosed with coronavirus last week and was being treated in hospital, but sadly died this morning. â€œHe leaves a huge hole in the Leeds United family, his legacy will never be forgotten and our thoughts are with Normanâ€™s family and friends at this very difficult time,â€ a Leeds statement read. PETITION: Sign the petition to get Captain Tom Moore knighted Rest in peace Norman pic.twitter.com/Fq38EJK6Pn Hunter left Leeds for Bristol City and also played for Barnsley as well as earning 28 England caps. Hunter went on to manage Barnsley, Rotherham and Bradford but retired in 1990. The coronavirus has taken nearly 14,000 people in the UK so far with over 100,000 confirmed cases of the virus. The pandemic has changed the world as we know it with most people asked to remain at home and isolate from others. Hunter's death however marks a dark day in football and follows an update from Leeds yesterday when they said he remained â€˜severely unwellâ€™. They wrote: â€œNorman Hunter continues to battle the COVID-19 virus in hospital and whilst he is, as expected, fighting incredibly hard, remains severely unwell. â€œHis family would like to take this opportunity to thank all Leeds United supporters for their amazing messages and well wishes. â€œThey would also like to say a huge thank you the NHS doctors and nurses who continue to do an amazing job 24 hours a day for Norman and all of those currently in their care. Leeds United are devastated to learn of the passing of club icon Norman Hunter at the age of 76. Norman was taken to hospital last week after being diagnosed with COVID-19 and despite continuing to battle and the best efforts of NHS staff, he sadly lost his fight earlier this morning. Born on Friday 29th October 1943 in Eighton Banks, County Durham, Hunter left school at the age of 15 to become an electrical fitter. Playing for Birtley Juniors, he was scouted by Leeds and following a trial game was offered a place on the clubâ€™s ground staff. Making his Leeds debut against Swansea Town at the age of 18 on Saturday 8th September 1962, he helped Don Revieâ€™s side to a 2-0 victory and would go on to become one of the greatest centre-backs the game has ever seen. Hunter amassed a huge 726 appearances for Leeds United over a 14 year period, the clubâ€™s most successful to date, earning the infamous nickname ""Bites Yer Legs"". Helping Leeds rise from the Second Division, Hunter was at the heart of the defence as the club became champions of England twice and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup winners twice, along with successes in the 1968 League Cup, 1969 Charity Shield and 1972 FA Cup. He won a total of 28 caps for England and was in the 1966 World Cup winning squad, whilst was also the first winner of the PFA Players' Player of the Year in 1974. Hunter left Leeds to join Bristol City in 1976, prior to a spell at Barnsley, who he later went on to manage along with Rotherham United. Norman remained part of the furniture at Elland Road throughout the years, being a regular speaker in the suite named in his honour, and was in attendance as recently as last monthâ€™s victory over Huddersfield Town. He leaves a huge hole in the Leeds United family, his legacy will never be forgotten and our thoughts are with Normanâ€™s family and friends at this very difficult time.  â€œAs a club, we would also like to thank our fans, the wider football community and the media for respecting the wishes of privacy from the family at this time. â€œWe will continue to provide regular updates in the coming days. â€œKeep fighting Norman, we are all with you.â€ Kenny Dalglish was also in hospital last week with the virus but has left and is recovering, while Clive Allen also tested positive. England tweeted: â€œWe're extremely saddened to learn of the passing of Norman Hunter at the age of 76. â€œNorman was part of our @FIFAWorldCup-winning squad and won 28 caps for the #ThreeLions. All of our thoughts are with his family, friends and supporters at this time.â€ See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",0,
270,Coronavirus Italy: Prime Minister Conte set to extend lockdown as COVID-19 deaths grow | World | News | Express.co.uk,Aurora Bosotti," The coronavirus pandemic forced Italy to order a partial lockdown last week in a desperate attempt to slow down the spread of the deadly virus. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte rolled out a series of measures urging people to stay home as much as possible and practice social distancing to avoid contagion. But after Italy recorded its highest number of deaths in one day, Mr Conte is now expected to extend the security quarantine past the original April 3 deadline. Speaking to national newspaper Il Corriere della Sera, the Italian Prime Minister hinted at a postponement well into April. Mr Conte said: ""We're moving toward an extension of the total bloc imposed until April 3. ""The lockdown of shops, as well as schools and universities, can only be extended to a date yet to be set."" Latest reports from the Italian Civil Protection service reported 475 people have died across Italy on Wednesday after testing positive to coronavirus. JUST IN: London on brink of FULL lockdown as PM vows 'further and faster measures' over coronavirus   The number of deaths forced the Italian Army to deploy to Bergamo in Lombardy, the Italian region most hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to move out the bodies of the victims to neighbouring crematoriums after the local facilities became overwhelmed. Bergamo has recorded at least 93 coronavirus-related deaths as the number of cases continues to sky-rocket every day. The mayor of Bergamo, Giorgio Gori, said the true number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 could be much higher as many people with symptoms died before being tested. A spokesperson for the local authority said: ""The crematorium of Bergamo, working at full capacity, 24 hours a day, can cremate 25 dead. ""It is clear that it could not stand up to the numbers of the past few days."" READ MORE: Army puts 20,000 troops ON STANDBY in Boris Johnson's new Covid Support Force  A man has shared the personal account of an Italian citizen in quarantine and his experiences leading up to the point of lockdown. Jason Yanowitz shared the citizenâ€™s analysis of the apparent six stages of Italyâ€™s coronavirus fight and urged Britons to understand the seriousness of the situation. Mr Yanowitz said of the Italianâ€™s experiences and thesis: ""If you're still hanging with friends, going to restaurants/bars, and acting like this isn't a big deal, get your s**t together.

But many were quick to criticise the thread of tweets, accusing Mr Yanowitz of stirring up fear and potentially amplifying the issues of stockpiling and panic buying.

WHO officials have said they want to see programs rolled out similar to that in VÃ² which include repeat testing for everyone regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. This approach would lead to the isolation of asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19 who would otherwise not have known they are infected and possibly spread the sickness to others.

173,COVID-19 Found in Toilet Paper,Now8News,"(CNN)Masks were the first to go. Then, hand sanitizers.

Now, novel coronavirus panic buyers are snatching up … toilet paper?

Retailers in the US and Canada have started limiting the number of toilet paper packs customers can buy in one trip. Some supermarkets in the UK are sold out. Grocery stores in Australia have hired security guards to patrol customers.

But now the coronavirus has been found in the one place people never expected, toilet paper.

An estimated 6000 more people have contracted the virus in the United States tied to a contamination of toilet paper. Testing buy Washington State Health department confirmed the COVID-19 virus particles were present in the samples they took from five separate packages of toilet paper from Big Box stores. The CDC said this strain of deadly virus “breeds rapidly in tissue fibers.”

The CDC is urging people to using a wet washcloth when cleaning themselves after using the bathroom instead of toilet paper.

“Use a washcloth to clean yourself after you go to the bathroom, it’s not a big deal, that’s what we did back in the old days,” said Peter Lendl, who headed the investigation of the contaminated toilet paper. “Just know which one is yours.”

State Health departments are asking you to set your toilet paper outside so hazmat workers can come by and dispose of the contaminated items.

“We all need to work together,” said Peter. “We need each other as a community, as a society.”

Stores have been ordered to halt all sales of toilet paper until further notice. Toilet paper factories are being shut down while sanitation measures are being taken.",1,
538,"Myanmar has zero coronavirus cases, claims Aung San Suu Kyi | World news | The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch,"The porous Myanmar-China border stretches more than 1,400 miles but coronavirus cases have only been reported on one side. In China, more than 80,800 people have been infected, but according to Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmarâ€™s civilian leader, the country has not yet seen a single confirmed case. â€œUntil now, no one in our country is infected with Covid-19,â€ said the countryâ€™s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in a televised address on Monday. To the countryâ€™s west, 114 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in India and five in Bangladesh. Myanmarâ€™s southern neighbour, Thailand, has reported 114 cases. Attempting to explain the anomaly, a spokesperson for Myanmarâ€™s government has claimed that peopleâ€™s â€œlifestyle and dietâ€ protected them from the disease â€“ stoking concerns the country is downplaying the impact of the respiratory illness. Zaw Htay, a government spokesperson, also said the common use of cash instead of credit cards, helped curb the spread of the illness. There is no evidence to show that diet or banknotes can stop the spread of coronavirus. â€œSuch irresponsible statements clash with everything known about the coronavirus outbreak, defy reality, and only serve to give a false sense of security to the countryâ€™s people about the disease and their risks of infection,â€ said Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division at Human Rights Watch, in a blog post. Ten patients in Myanmar are currently in quarantine awaiting test results, according to the government. Globally, there are more than 161,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in 150 countries or territories. The World Health Organization said the global threat from the respiratory illness is high. â€œThe governmentâ€™s public lack of concern has sparked rumours and speculation about the governmentâ€™s response, leaving many distrustful and unable to make informed decisions for their families,â€ Robertson said. Aung Aung, a surgeon at Mandalay general hospital in Myanmar, told the New York Times: â€œI donâ€™t think Myanmar has the modern techniques to know whether the virus is here.â€ Facing questions from reporters, Zaw Htay acknowledged scepticism about the governmentâ€™s claim there are no coronavirus cases in the country, but insisted it was accurate. Even without any reported cases, the government has banned festivals and entertainment events in April, including the Thingyan festival, the biggest annual holiday in the country. The government has also started a fund to raise money from the public to support its response to the illness. â€œI urge those of you who would like to donate to give as much as you can,â€ said Aung San Suu Kyi.",0,

190,The Coronavirus Is China's Fault,Elise Cooper,"The world has not seen this dangerous of a virus since the Spanish flu of 1917.  But in today's world, the press and the Democrats use it as a political football.  They blame President Trump instead of the ones who are really culpable: the Chinese Communist government.  American Thinker interviewed experts on China to get their opinions on who is really to blame.

In looking at the Chinese government over the years, should Americans think of them as friendly, adversaries, enemies, or ""frenemies""?  Gordan Chang (@GordonGChang), an expert on Chinese affairs, is also a columnist, lawyer, and author of The Coming Collapse of China.  He explained to American Thinker, ""Last May China defined their role, declaring a people's war on the US.  If China viewed America as an enemy then they should be viewed as an enemy.""

But the Democrats and mass media do not look on China as the enemy.  Rather, they consider President Donald Trump the enemy.  Just consider Andrew Yang, who recently said Trump is a racist for referring to the ""Chinese Flu.""  Anonymouscy Pelosi said of the president that he is about ""delay, denial, death.""  They ignore what Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx have said: ""[t]he first and only time that Dr. [Deborah] Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president to actually have a shutdown in the sense of strong mitigation, we discussed it.  Obviously, there would be concerns by some, and in fact, that might have some negative consequences.  Nonetheless, the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation.  The next, second time that I went with Dr. Birx to the president and said 15 days are not enough, we need to go 30 days, he also listened.""

Chang does not think the president should be blamed: ""I have been looking at this for quite some time and it took me by surprise.  He got the first and most important decision correct: the travel restrictions on China.  Maybe he should have put the travel restrictions on Europe sooner, but overall, he has done a lot right.  Looking from a partisan lens, the Democratic Party has nothing to boast about.  Clearly, President Trump was blamed because he is blamed for everything.""

Interestingly, some Americans accuse President Trump of ignoring the doctors and scientists.  Maybe they should refer back to what was said.  Dr. Deborah Birx said during one of the press conferences that any lack of preparation from U.S. officials in responding to the coronavirus pandemic was due to the fact that ""we were missing a significant amount of the data"" from China.  Dr. Fauci told Watters' World, ""It was in January at a time when the Chinese were saying first that it was only going from an animal to a human and then when there were human cases that looked like they were ... inefficiently transmitted.""  He also told Newsmax that because of the Chinese disinformation, he downplayed the virus risk: ""[t]his is not a major threat for the people in the United States, and this is not something the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about.""

Did the communist Chinese government do this intentionally?  Was it an accident, or was it bio-terrorism?  Chang believes that ""maybe, at first, it was an accidental escape, but in the middle of the process, they turned it into a bioweapon to deliberately sicken people around the world.  They wanted to even the score because they were crippled and decided to cripple everyone else.  What they did was deny that it was human-to-human transferrable even though they knew by the second week in December.  At the same time, they tried to prevent other countries from imposing travel restrictions.  Putting these together is what caused this to be a global pandemic.""

Joe Biden loves to sit in his basement and criticize the president for being soft on China and being inept in handling the virus.  Not fair, says another expert on China, Steven W. Mosher, (@StevenWMosher), who is also a social scientist, Fox News pundit, and author of the book Bully of Asia.  ""I am a Sinologist and read the Chinese papers, and I did not see any signs.  I believed Dr. Fauci when he said it was no different than SARS in January.  If Hillary Clinton or Biden had won in 2016, flights from China would not have been closed.  We would have had an outbreak all over America, overwhelming the medical system.  There would have been hundreds of thousands of deaths.  Clinton and Biden would not have listened to scientific evidence, but listened to the lies told by China.  I would much rather see Donald Trump in charge than either Democrat.  The American people should not forget that up until a few weeks ago, Biden was criticizing Trump for being racist and xenophobic about the travel ban.""

He further stated, ""Biden is trying to get to the right on Trump with regard to China by counting on the media to carry water for him.  I hope that turning Biden's weakness on China into a strength will not fly.  After all, he has made nice on China for over thirty years.  Also, the Obama administration, in which Biden was vice president, did not replace the ventilators, masks, and medical equipment.  We went into this war against the virus unarmed because the Obama administration dropped the ball by not resupplying the strategic stockpile.""

Chang added that on May 1, 2019, Biden made two wrong statements about the Chinese: ""They are not bad folks, folks"" and ""they are not competition for the U.S.""  Chang went on to say, ""Biden has a terrible record on China, including post–Obama administration.  Any criticism by Biden is not fair or impartial.""

Both experts also emphasized that the World Health Organization (WHO) worked hand in hand with China.  When Biden said President Trump is weak on China, the Trump administration pointed to what he is doing with the WHO as a sign that he is showing strength.  Chang agrees with the move to defund this organization.  Chang pointed out that on January 14, the WHO supported Beijing, agreeing that there should not be travel restrictions, insisted that there was no human-to-human transmission, and agreed with the Chinese government's numbers on death and infection. 

Unlike the Democrats, who only criticize, these experts offer suggestions.  Chang wants Americans to beware and not to be complacent.  ""A month ago, people were saying biological weapons don't work because they are not practical.  But this is a great demonstration of how extensive it can be, to cripple an adversary.  Our enemies can see how to get to America.  Someone should be asking, what were the Chinese doing with all those coronaviruses at that lab?  There is no inspection in China.""

Mosher agreed and added that the ""Wuhan Institute of Virology was supposed to be a high-containment level four lab.  In 2018 the State Department published that it was actually operating as a level two low-containment lab.  I would say there was no containment and that the Chinese communist government has to be made to be transparent.""

Chang also wants American companies out of China and to impose fiAnonymouscial costs on China.  ""We should do what Japan is doing to get Japanese manufacturing companies to leave.  Larry Kudlow said a few weeks ago the American companies that left should be given a 100% write-off.  I would give the president high marks for changing the policy.  I would also like to see seizure of Chinese assets and to consider all options short of force.  They maliciously assaulted our society, and America needs to impose such costs on China that they will never do it again.""

Americans should be aware of what China is capable of.  The Democrats do not make any constructive suggestions.  Their only policy is to blame President Trump and make sure he is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.",1,
269,Nancy Pelosi Caught Once Again Trying to Include Abortion Funding in Coronavirus Bill,STEVEN ERTELT,"For the third time in recent weeks, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is attempting to exploit the coronavirus crisis to push her abortion agenda on the American people.
During the development of the first stimulus bill to tackle the coronavirus situation, White House officials caught Pelosi trying to force Americans to fund abortions because she put funding in the bill under a section of HHS where the provisions of the Hyde Amendment would not apply.
Then, Pelosi tried to include funding for the Planned Parenthood abortion company in the bill to provide economic relief for small businesses, even though Planned Parenthood is a profitable abortion corporation that technically is a nonprofit. President trump and Republicans stopped that form happening.
But because additional legislation is needed to provide Americans economic relief in the face of extended lockdowns, Pelosi is back at it — trying to remove the safeguards from the previous bill to exclude Planned Parenthood from small business bailouts in her new Phase 4 relief legislation.
Tom McClusky, president of March for Life Action, caught Pelosi’s latest attempt.
“Speaker Pelosi’s latest $3 trillion wish list is not about helping those suffering from Covid-19 – it is an election scheme focused on helping pro-abortion Democrats win in 2020. Her proposal includes the removal of safeguards in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) that prevent taxpayer money from bailing out the billion-dollar abortion-giant Planned Parenthood,” he told LifeNews.com. According to the bill, states would be free to pass along taxpayer dollars to the Planned Parenthood abortion business from the hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars states would receive.
McClusky told LifeNews that Planned Parenthood doesn’t deserve a dime of taxpayer funds, because it is the largest abortion business in the country but also because it is “an organization which has dedicated $45 million this cycle to electing pro-abortion politicians, like Pelosi, who will do their bidding.”
Pelosi’s bill also funds abortions directly with taxpayer dollars, overturning the long-standing Hyde provisions.
“The bill would also allow federal tax dollars to pay for abortions through subsidized health care plans. And, at the state and local level, it authorizes over $900 billion in open-ended funding – so nothing would prevent this money from further subsidizing the abortion industry. This bill would be disaster for the unborn,” McClusky concluded.
On the first bill, the Senate ultimately passed a clean bill to provide funding to combat the coronavirus that contains language preventing the funds from being used to pay for abortions. now lawmakers will have to stop Pelosi once again.
Nancy Pelosi has a long history of promoting abortion and her first act after becoming Speaker in 2019 was pushing legislation to use tax money for abortions. So it’s no surprise she is trying to exploit the Coronavirus pandemic to push abortion funding again.",1,

192,"Virologists are LYING about the origins of coronavirus: Yes, the coronavirus contains gain-of-function gene sequences that were INSERTED into the virus",Ethan Huff,"For months, the establishment has been dishing out a narrative claiming that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a natural, albeit mysterious and unexplained, phenomenon that probably originated at a Chinese meat market. But contrary evidence continues to surface suggesting that the virus actually originated inside a Chinese laboratory and research center.

Many virologists continue to deny this, of course, claiming that there is no evidence to support the notion that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) might in any way be unnatural. But the genetic hallmarks they are looking for as proof may not be as evident as previously believed because modern genetic engineering can be done without leaving a trace.

Believe it or not, a Swiss research team was able to create a synthetic clone of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in less than a month. And they did this by inserting genetic fragments in such a way that, unless a scientist knows exactly what to look for, would not necessarily be apparent.

Over the past 15-20 years, researchers have been actively studying, dissecting, reconstructing and otherwise tampering with coronaviruses of various types. This includes the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which one scientific researcher describes as an “obvious chimera,” meaning it is a combination of at least two pre-existing viruses.

This scientist, who goes by the name of Yuri Deigin and edits the Open Longevity journal both in Russian and English, says that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is based on an ancestral bat strain of coronavirus known as RaTG13, but with a replaced receptor binding motif (RBM) in its spike protein.

The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) also contains an added stretch of four different amino acids that he says were inserted into the virus, creating a furin cleavage site “that, as virologists have previously established, significantly expands the ‘repertoire’ of the virus in terms of whose cells it can penetrate.”Because of this, Deigin speculates, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was probably able to mutate and jump species, leaving its original host and infecting humans. And it just so happens that this very type of research was taking place at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China, which is where the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) originated.

Virologists like Shi Zhengli, Deigin points out, have “done many similar things in the past,” including replacing the RBM in one type of virus with the RBM of another. They have also added new furin sites to coronaviruses, creating new artificial species-specific coronaviruses that borrow from other coronaviruses in their ability to do new things. Now this does not necessarily mean that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was an intentional bioweapon, at least in Deigin’s view. It could be that it was an experiment gone wrong rather than an intentional effort at plunging the entire world into a pandemic. At the same time, it does seem clear that the virus did, in fact, come from a lab, and probably from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Deigin uncovered that between the years of 2007 and 2017, Shi Zhengli and colleagues created at least eight new chimeric coronaviruses with a variety of RBMs. And in 2019, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) actually gave the Wuhan Institute of Virology $3.7 million as part of a grant entitled, Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence.

That same year, Shi Zhengli co-authored a paper calling for continued research into these and other synthetic viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, arguing that there are “no clinical treatments or prevention strategies” currently available with regard to human coronaviruses.

All of this is highly suspicious, seeing as how 2019 was the very same year that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first emerged in China, and in the same city where Shi Zhengli and colleagues were working on similar coronaviruses. There is little doubt that this chimeric virus originated in that lab, despite continued denial by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). But it no longer matters what the CCP claims as people all over the world are figuring out the truth on their own. It is at least apparent that something went amiss with the containment of this virus, and it is possible that whatever happened was intentional.

Deigin lays out the details from Shi Zhengli’s 2019 paper about the relative ease with which even a graduate student in the field could create such a virus. He also spells out the detailed biology of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) as evidence that it definitely matches the type of thing that Shi Zhengli describes.

Based on the evidence he puts forth, which you can peruse in its entirety at this link, the only logical conclusion is that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is genetically modified and came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also traces the origins of the RaTG13 strain from which the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was derived.

Amazingly, Shi Zhengli admitted just this year that she was the one who isolated RaTG13 back in 2013 from YunAnonymous horseshoe bats of the Rhinolophus affinis variety. None of this was known, however, until January 2020 when the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) first started arriving in the U.S. All of this absolutely implicates communist China in the unleashing of this global pandemic, not to mention the NIH that helped to fund this type of research. Heads need to roll, and those who have been victimized by this thing – including everyone who has been forced into lockdown – deserves a full measure of justice.

Bioweapon or not, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a product of China, as well as a product of our own federal government. And both entities need to be held accountable for the roles they played in scourging the planet with this invisible beast.

On the other hand, if it was all just an accident as Deigin believes was probably the case, then those involved need to fess up and admit their error rather than continue to claim that this is all just some wild conspiracy theory.",1,
154,WAVES OF MUTILATION: MEDICAL TYRANNY AND THE CASHLESS SOCIETY,Brandon Smith,"Back in 2014 during the Ebola scare in the US I published an article warning about how a global pandemic could be used by the elites as cover for the implementation of an economic collapse as well as martial law measures in western nations. My immediate concern was the way in which a viral outbreak could be engineered or exploited as a rationale for a level of social control that the public would never accept under normal circumstances. And this could be ANY viral outbreak, not just Ebola. The point is the creation of an “invisible enemy” that the populace cannot quantify and defend itself against without constant government oversight. I noted specifically how the government refused to apply air travel restrictions in 2014 to nations where the outbreak had taken hold when they could have stopped the spread in its tracks. This is something that was done again in 2020 as the UN’s WHO and governments including our government in the US refused to stop air travel from China, pretending as if it was not a hot zone and that the virus was nothing to worry about.

This attitude of nonchalance serves a purpose. The establishment NEEDS the pandemic to spread, because then they have a rationale for strict controls of pubic activities and movements. This is the end goal. They have no care whatsoever for public health or safety. The end game is to acquire power, not save lives.  In fact, they might prefer a higher death count in the beginning as this would motivate the public to beg for more restrictions in the name of security.

Authorities went from downplaying the outbreak and telling people not to bother with preparations like purchasing N95 masks, to full blown crisis mode only weeks later. In January Trump initially claimed he “trusted” the data out of China and said that “everything was under control”; as usual only a couple months down the road and Trump flip-flopped on both assertions.  The World Health Organization refused to even label this outbreak a “pandemic” until the virus was entrenched across the globe.  The question people will ask is, was this all due to incompetence, or was it social engineering?

The Ebola event six years ago seems to have been a dry run for what is happening today.  I believe it is entirely deliberate, and I will explain why in this article, but either way, governments have proven they cannot be trusted to handle the pandemic crisis, nor can they be trusted to protect the people and their freedoms.

At the same time, the pandemic itself is tightly intertwined with economic collapse. The two events feed off one another. The pandemic provides perfect cover for the crash of the massive debt bubble central banks and international banks have created over the years. I noted in February that the global economy was crashing long before the coronavirus ever showed up.  At the same time, economic chaos increases 3rd world conditions within each country, which means poor nutrition and health care options that cause more sickness and more deaths from the virus. As outlined in 2014:

 

“Who would question the event of an economic collapse in the wake of an Ebola (virus) soaked nightmare? Who would want to buy or sell? Who would want to come in contact with strangers to generate a transaction? Who would even leave their house? Ebola (viral) treatment in first world nations has advantages of fiAnonymousce and a cleaner overall health environment, but what if economic downturn happens simultaneously? America could experience third world status very quickly, and with it, all the unsanitary conditions that result in an exponential Ebola (pandemic) death rate.

…Amidst even a moderate or controlled viral scenario, stocks and bonds will undoubtedly crash, a crash that was going to happen anyway. The international banks who created the mess get off blameless, while Ebola (viral outbreak), an act of nature, becomes the ultimate scapegoat for every disaster that follows.”

As the double threat of fiAnonymouscial collapse and viral pandemic accelerate, fear becomes widespread for those that never prepared ahead of time (and we’re talking about millions of people).  When people are afraid they tend to sacrifice their freedoms to anyone that offers them a promise of safety, no matter how empty. For now, the public is being convinced to assume that lockdowns and restrictions are temporary, but this is a lie. The elites must maintain and increase restrictions with each passing month in order to prevent rebellion until they are ready to implement martial law measures.

You see, the establishment is going for broke with this event, and because of this there is the potential for them to face dire consequences. The facade is quickly evaporating; the collectivists and globalists are risking exposure of themselves and their political puppets in order to build a totalitarian system with extreme speed. The establishment must keep the pressure on for now, because if the public is allowed to breath for just a moment they might look around and wake up to the bigger agenda. The public has to be forced to beg for aid from the authorities; only then will the pressure be lifted for a short time. The public has to believe the control grid was THEIR idea.

A new process of mass conditioning is about to be set in motion, using “waves” of panic and then waves of release and calm. After studying the behavioral traits and methods of narcissistic sociopaths (psychopaths) for many years, I can tell you this form of conditioning is very familiar. This is exactly what they always do, just on a global scale – They create an atmosphere of crisis to keep people around them unbalanced and on edge, then “relieve the pressure” intermittently so that those same people relax and their anger is deflated for a time. Then, the process starts all over again…

This conditioning traps the narcopath’s victims in a constant state of flux and uncertainty, and the moments of calm become a placebo which prevent their rebellion against him. He can then feed off his victims at his leisure like a psychological vampire, and often these victims will see the narcopath as their only means of support. They have been convinced that all the threats are coming from the outside; they do not realize the source of the threats is the person standing right next to them.


 
The wave model of conditioning and control is starting to show up everywhere, and it is most blatant in the intended “solution” presented by establishment elites in response to the coronavirus outbreak. As Truthstream Media outlined in their excellent video ‘We Are Living In 12 Monkeys’, MIT recently published a paper written by their globalist editor in chief Gideon Lichfield titled ‘We’re Not Going Back To Normal’ which admits quite brazenly how the elites intend to use this crisis to their advantage.

Lichfield lays out a kind of programming schedule for the population based on waves of viral infection outbreaks, waves of tight social restrictions, followed by waves of limited economic activity and limited calm over the next 18 months. As Lichfield suggests:

“To stop coronavirus we will need to radically change almost everything we do: how we work, exercise, socialize, shop, manage our health, educate our kids, take care of family members.

We all want things to go back to normal quickly. But what most of us have probably not yet realized—yet will soon—is that things won’t go back to normal after a few weeks, or even a few months. Some things never will.”

He continues:

“As long as someone in the world has the virus, breakouts can and will keep recurring without stringent controls to contain them. In a report yesterday researchers at Imperial College London proposed a way of doing this: impose more extreme social distancing measures every time admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) start to spike, and relax them each time admissions fall…”

Understand that there are 7 billion people on the planet, and this process of control could go on for years while we wait for every person to overcome the virus or die from it.  The only way for the public to escape this purgatory (according to Lichfield) is for them to submit to a biometric data grid. They must volunteer (or be forced) to participate in 24/7 tracking through their cell phones and through mass surveillance. In order to function in society, an individual must have the proper digital marker which tells the authorities that they are “clean” and devoid of infection.  The system is being used in China right now:



This system achieves a number of things. Much like the social credit system China has been using for the past few years, the public is compelled to constantly appease the hidden but all seeing eye of government. Everything they do is watched by algorithms and surveillance. Any deviation might trigger scrutiny and a loss of simple freedoms to move around or participate in normal human interaction. Lichfield argues:

“Ultimately, however, I predict that we’ll restore the ability to socialize safely by developing more sophisticated ways to identify who is a disease risk and who isn’t, and discriminating—legally—against those who are.


 
…one can imagine a world in which, to get on a flight, perhaps you’ll have to be signed up to a service that tracks your movements via your phone. The airline wouldn’t be able to see where you’d gone, but it would get an alert if you’d been close to known infected people or disease hot spots. There’d be similar requirements at the entrance to large venues, government buildings, or public transport hubs. There would be temperature scanners everywhere, and your workplace might demand you wear a monitor that tracks your temperature or other vital signs. Where nightclubs ask for proof of age, in future they might ask for proof of immunity—an identity card or some kind of digital verification via your phone, showing you’ve already recovered from or been vaccinated against the latest virus strains.”

And there you have it. The social and biometric control grid that globalists have been hungry to set up for years now has the perfect catalyst – a viral pandemic which could cycle indefinitely; all that would be needed is to release a designer virus every couple years which renews public fear. The populace becomes increasingly dependent on government for everything as their very survival depends on their ability to function within the new economy, and without a special mark granted by government saying you are not an infection risk, you could be shunned from all trade and participation.

Refuse to get vaccinated due to health concerns?  You’re kicked out of the economy.  Homeschool your children?  They have not been monitored and are therefore an infection risk, and your whole family is kicked out of the economy.  Hold political views that are contrary to globalism?  Maybe you are listed as a danger to the system and wrongly labeled infected as punishment; and then you are kicked out of the economy.  The establishment can use the threat of economic removal to condition many people into complacency or slavery.

The MIT editor goes on to drive his point home in rather arrogant fashion:

“We’ll adapt to and accept such measures, much as we’ve adapted to increasingly stringent airport security screenings in the wake of terrorist attacks. The intrusive surveillance will be considered a small price to pay for the basic freedom to be with other people.”

Beyond the effort to turn “social distancing” into a new cultural norm enforced by law, there is another agenda being quietly instituted – the cashless society. More and more businesses are starting to refuse cash payments, claiming that paper cash spreads the virus.  Oddly enough, they still accept debit cards using pin pads which are much more likely than cash to spread disease.

This may force the public to keep their money in banks despite the threat of a credit freeze or bank holiday. What if you pull cash out of your accounts but are not able to spend it anywhere? Eventually, they will ban debit and credit card transactions in stores as well, and replace them with a non-interactive payment model. This will probably be done through your cell phone in the beginning using a scanning app. In the end, they will use your biometric data for all money transactions.

This forces the public, yet again, to carry a cell phone on them everywhere for their very survival. The tracking network for the virus as well as the new payment transaction system makes this device indispensable. If you want to participate in society, you will have no choice but to be tracked and traced at all times.

Unless, of course, you build your own system of trade and interaction.

The solution to medical tyranny and the cashless society is to not need the system at all for your own survival. This means people will have to build their own economies based on barter and local scrip. They will have to dump their cell phones and rely on other forms of communication such as radio, or establish a digital communication system separate and independent from the establishment system. They will have to become producers and achieve more self reliance. They will have to break free from the grid, and this has to start RIGHT NOW.

Of course, the establishment will claim that these independent people are a threat to everyone else simply by existing.  They will perpetuate the lie of “herd immunity” and will claim that independent people will “spread the virus”, even to those who are supposedly protected through vaccination. And eventually they will try to stop decoupled and localized communities from existing using force. At that point we simply go to war with the elites, as we were always going to have to do anyway. The alternative is slavery in the name of the “greater good”, but there is no greater good without freedom, and there is no society without individuality. Pandemic be damned.",1,
333,Lewis Hamilton and co urged by Nico Hulkenberg to cut pay as coronavirus threatens F1 jobs | F1 | Sport | Express.co.uk,James Benson," Lewis Hamilton and his F1 rivals should forego some of their mega wages during the coronavirus pandemic which is threatening the futures of personnel across the sport. That is the verdict of former Renault driver Nico Hulkenberg, who feels for people whose jobs are on the line due to the crisis. F1 bosses are currently scrambling to salvage the 2020 season and prevent teams from going to the wall after the first nine Grands Prix of the campaign were called off. McLaren chief executive Zak Brown has revealed fears that up to four teams may disappear if the chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic is not taken seriously. Brown, Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris have taken the lead at McLaren by taking pay cuts in a bid to help the team curb costs. The British team have also put a large number of their staff on furlough through the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS). Racing Point, Williams, Haas and Renault have taken similar measures, with the likes of Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll voluntarily giving up some of their salaries to help out too. READ MORE: Lewis Hamilton craves Max Verstappen battle  Hulkenberg has now put the onus on all drivers - from Mercedes star Hamilton at the top of the earnings standings to those lower down - to forego money they are owed. And while he admits it's simple for him to call on drivers to do so because he's currently out of the F1 loop, he says they should feel ""obliged"" to help save jobs. ""It's easy for me to comment because it does not concern me,"" Hulkenberg told German outlet Auto Moto und Sport. ""But I do believe that drivers have to support their teams, especially in times when companies have to fight for their livelihoods. ""The football players also waive part of their salaries.

486,San Diego Comic-Con canceled for first time amid coronavirus outbreak - Reuters,,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - San Diego Comic-Con, an annual celebrity-studded showcase of superhero films and pop culture, has been canceled for the first time in its 50-year history due to the global coronavirus outbreak, organizers said on Friday. Comic-Con had been scheduled to take place in July. The event typically draws tens of thousands of costumed revelers to a San Diego convention hall and surrounding streets, restaurants and hotels. â€œContinuous monitoring of health advisories and recent statements by the Governor of California have made it clear that it would not be safe to move forward with plans for this year,â€ organizers said in a statement posted on the conventionâ€™s website. The next San Diego Comic-Con is scheduled for July 22-25, 2021, the statement said. Comic-Con had become a major event for TV networks and movie producers to promote upcoming programming. Last yearâ€™s lineup featured Angelina Jolie and Natalie Portman talking about their roles in upcoming films from Walt Disney Coâ€™s (DIS.N) Marvel Studios, and Tom Cruise previewing a new â€œTop Gunâ€ movie.

155,"WHILE THE WORLD IS IN DISARRAY, COVID-19 IS BREAKING UP RUSSIA",Anonymous,"Since first being recorded in China in December 2019, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has spread around the world, been declared a pandemic and sent billions of people into lockdown. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world is nearing one million, more and more draconian measures limiting the basic freedoms (like the freedom of movement and freedom of speech) of citizens are being introduced under the pretext of the need to contain the pandemic.

These swift and unprecedented changes of the social-political system around the world give rise to concerns that the world will never return to the pre-COVID-19 state and ‘temporary measures’ imposed to ‘contain the COVID-19 threat’ may turn into our new reality.

As of April 2 morning, there have been 936,865 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 47,263 deaths around the world. The United States, Italy, Spain with 215,344, 110,574 and 104,118 cases respectively. At the same time, the death rate in Italy and Spain is much higher than in the United States. This high death rate (every 8.4th infected in Italy and every 11th infected in Spain) turned the countries into a center of fear fueled by mainstream media reports designed to generate hype and attract the viewers’ attention amid the developing crisis. Bare figures provided by media without any additional context contribute to the growth of fear among the audience and justify further restrictions and emergency measures to contain the pandemic. At the same time, a more detailed look at the situation and commentaries by medical experts and scientists indicate that the real COVID-19 threat is lower than media paint it.

Igor Alekseevich Gundarov, a Doctor of Medicine, professor, member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, a specialist in the field of epidemiology and medical statistics, notes that the new coronavirus expansion may be linked with the previous successes in the field of combating the flu.

The new virus simply filled the created vacuum in the virus micro world that surrounds humanity. According to Gundarov, the current crisis, which caused the pandemic of fear additionally to the COVID-19 pandemic, is the result of the specific media coverage and political-motivated decisions of particular actors. Even countries that are almost not affected impose strict measures and limit freedoms of their citizens due to the COVID-19 outbreak. A curious situation is developing inside Russia. As of April 2, there were 3,548 COVID-19 cases that led 30 deaths only. The measures approved by the Federal Government demonstrate that the Russian leadership fully understand the threat of fake news attacks and foreign-instigated panic, as well as treats seriously destructive actions of separate persons and organizations that intentionally ignore the anti-pandemic measures.

On the other hand, the ‘administrative self-isolation’ measures employed by some regions contribute to the de-facto fragmentation of the Russian Federation and the introduction of Orwellian control measures over people living in the key regions, like Moscow, the Moscow region and the Republic of Tatarstan. These actions of regional authorities violate both the Russian Constitution and the federal laws.

The spreading regime of ‘administrative self-isolation’ in the Russian regions seems to have been initiated by some of the regional elites (i.e.not by the federal center or Putin and his team). The way that the heads of particular regions are acting makes it look like they are implementing pre-planned actions aimed at dramatically increasing their own political power and wresting authority away from the central government.

The central government enables this behavior under the pressure of the media and political hysteria around the world or remains misinformed about the real situation.

All of these developments came in a very sensitive time for Russia, which is now passing through the constitutional reform and suffering from the dramatic fall of the oil prices. The imposed anti-COVID-19 measures also damage the local business and the job market throwing people out of their positions. In the event of the negative scenario, this may rapidly lead to the deterioration of the social and economic situation across the country.

Authorities say that introduced surveillance measures and limitations of freedoms will be canceled after the end of the COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, the historical practice demonstrates that there is a nonzero probability that they will remain, or will be only partially lifted, even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The specific of the Russian political culture, a complex tangle of contradictions within the Russian regional and federal elites, as well as the fact that a significant part of the Russian elites is affiliated with the collective West contribute to this scenario.

Therefore, the developments triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to the deformation of the political and administrative structure of the Russian Federation, and lead to notable social and economic tensions. If this scenario turns into reality, the stability of the entire Eurasian region will be undermined.",1,
246,Don’t buy China’s story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab,Steven W. Mosher,"At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future. A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue. Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swathes of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.” Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”? It turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic. That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.
According to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.
Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Gen. Chen’s job is to try and put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me. Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken. And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them. You heard me right. Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach. Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die. They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus. I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither are pangolins, for that matter, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat. The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens. China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high. But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge. I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we.",1,
327,European shares gain as Trump plans to reopen U.S. economy - Reuters,,"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) April 17 (Reuters) - European shares jumped on Friday, clawing back weekly declines as financial markets globally drew comfort from U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s plans for a gradual re-opening of the U.S. economy and reports of a potential drug to treat COVID-19. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 2.5% at 0712 GMT, shrugging off data showing China suffered its worst economic contraction in almost three decades as the pandemic crushed business activity. All the major European sub-sectors were trading higher, with mining stocks surging 4.1% on the back of higher commodity prices. The benchmark STOXX 600 has now recovered about 24% since hitting an eight-year low in March, powered by a raft of global stimulus and tentative signs the pandemic was peaking in the worst hit parts of the continent.

470,Complete shutdown of UK universities due to Covid-19 'impossible' | Education | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/annafazackerley,"University vice-chancellors have told the government they cannot completely shut down if the coronavirus outbreak worsens because thousands of students would be left with nowhere to go. The higher education regulator for England, the Office for Students (OfS), wrote to all universities on Monday, requesting ongoing information on the number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus on campus, as well as details of how institutions are responding to them. It is understood that any decisions about whether to instruct universities to close would be taken by the Department for Education (DfE). A spokesperson for the OfS said universities should â€œcontinue to follow advice from DfE and Public Health Englandâ€. However, vice-chancellors cautioned that the makeup of universities made their complete shutdown impossible. The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Prof Steve West, the vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, said: â€œMy bottom line back to government has been that they canâ€™t treat universities like big schools because we arenâ€™t. Iâ€™ve got 4,500 students living on campus: some of them are care leavers or estranged from their families and many are international students. We canâ€™t just shut down as they would have nowhere to go.â€ The vice-chancellor of a university in the elite Russell Group, who asked not to be named, agreed, saying: â€œWe couldnâ€™t fully close. What do you do with thousands of international students who canâ€™t go home?â€ The vice-chancellor said their university would provide free accommodation for international students who were stranded, even if the government told them to shut. UWE has set up an emergency helpline for worried students and parents. West said: â€œWe would operate something like a Christmas shutdown. The things you can shut down you do, such as lectures and sports. But you also have to provide vital support services for the students still here, including security, catering, wellbeing support and emergency phone lines.â€ He added that universities may need to mobilise students who are training as nurses, doctors and other health professionals to help bolster voverstretched NHS services. â€œWe need the flexibility to do that, and to support those students,â€ said West. Harvard University in the US told students on Tuesday that they must move out of their houses and student residences by no later than Sunday and that all classes would be conducted online after the spring holiday, in an attempt to contain the spread of the infection. No cases have yet been detected at the university. Oxford University said it would remain open despite a second student testing positive for coronavirus. In a statement it said: â€œPublic Health England has advised the university that the risk to other students and staff is very low and that university and college activities can continue as normal.â€ Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at Oxford, said the volume of people in universities represented a real challenge to containment: â€œOnly transport and inner urban streets clearly exceed the level of people-traffic that we can see in large universities. The end of term cannot come too soon.â€",0,

174,"Scientists Claim COVID-19 Mutating, Causing Psychosis in Sick",Now8News,"Scientists are busy preparing for a mass spread of COVID-19. Apparently, things will get worse before they get better.

COVID-19 lasts longer than a common acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI), two to three weeks, and sometimes leads to overwhelming pneumonia – it is only then that medical intervention, hospitalization, artificial ventilation, and the other things you are afraid of, become necessary. Here the rule is simple: if you start experiencing shortness of breath, urgently see a doctor. There are no effective drugs or strategies that can reduce the risk of shortness of breath with COVID-19.

Sunday evening a man who tested positive for COVID-19 attacked a woman in Miami, Florida just outside a 7-11 on the 1200 block of Brickell Bay Dr, According to witnesses the man punched the woman in the head them proceeded to “eat” her arm once she was knocked to the ground. Tom Missager saw the incident and stepped in to save the woman. “She was walking with her friends when the man attacked her,” said Missager. “At first I thought it was because she was Asian, but it quickly turned obvious that he randomly targeted her to eat her. He literally bit into her arm and tore out a chunk of her flesh. Me and my friends held him down until the cops get here. Now I’m worried I’ll have the virus.” The man was taken to the University of Miami Hospital where he tested positive for the virus. But doctors said it’s not what they are used to seeing.

“The strain has mutated into something much different than we’ve been seeing over the last month,” said Dr. William Shultz of University of Miami Hospital. “

Shultz says this different strain was likely caused through a mutation of the ancestral version of the virus. And that could mean more are coming. They urged the scientific community to come together to battle and contain the outbreak.

The man, who has not yet been identified, is being held for observation at the Miami Hospital while they quickly try to understand what this mutation means for the rest of the country.

276,Coronavirus: 'I've had to cancel my wedding' - BBC News,https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Holly Eason and her fiancÃ© have been planning their April wedding in their hometown of Tokyo for ages but now, thanks to coronavirus, they've had to cancel everything. Ms Eason, a teacher, couldn't risk her guests being exposed to infection. She said: ""I couldn't forgive myself if our celebration became the cause of a serious health condition. I'm also worried that my dad and my brother wouldn't be allowed to enter Japan. We just don't know what the situation will be at the time and I wouldn't want to go ahead without them being here."" She feels frustrated - but says safety is the priority. The coronavirus only emerged in December but is now a pandemic, with countries implementing lockdowns and travel restrictions. On the day the couple finally decided to cancel, their wedding invitations turned up at the home of Ms Eason's father, Mike, at his home in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in the UK. He said: ""It hit home the effort she had put into organise the day but as I am over 60, she was very worried about putting me and the others at risk. ""My daughter has arranged the wedding day herself as I cannot offer much help from the UK."" He said the family was now facing difficulty trying to get refunds. ""We cannot get our money back for the flights and hotel, so stand to write off approximately Â£5,000. I have tried to claim back through my credit card but despite being on hold for nearly 90 minutes (as everyone else is trying to get through too) they say there is nothing they can do."" The family hopes to reschedule the wedding at a later date, ideally during blossom season again. For Saavan Nathwani and Risha Modi, their dream wedding in Italy was supposed to be the happiest moment of their lives. But Ms Modi, who is from Harrow, London, said: ""In a matter of one week, our world was turned upside down, when the outbreak in Italy was announced. ""We were due to marry in Tuscany in about a month's time but now we're in a bit of a limbo and have no idea whether it's going to go ahead or if we should postpone or cancel. ""We had been planning for this wedding for nearly six months. We both work full-time and even though it has been a stressful and bumpy road, the only thing that kept us going was knowing we would marry one another."" She said they had more than 150 guests coming from all over the world including babies, grandparents and elderly relatives but many were now too scared to travel. With the response to the virus in the UK also changing rapidly, they also were concerned that it might be better to postpone if Britain eventually enters lockdown. Lauren Maitland and her fiance, Charlotte Armitage, have their fingers crossed their marriage will go ahead at The Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire in May. But Ms Maitland said: ""My mum has recently had a surgical procedure carried out on her heart and is recovering, while my granddad is 90 years old. Charlotte worries about her own parents daily too. ""Beyond that, we're nervous of large public gatherings being cancelled which would mean our ceremony couldn't go ahead, or indeed so many people having to self-quarantine meaning that the reception at Whitby Pavilion can't go ahead. ""We also have friends and family travelling from Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Germany and the USA. We're very nervous they won't be able to travel."" They have taken out wedding insurance and have travel insurance already in place for their 10-day honeymoon in Orlando, Florida and a week on a Royal Caribbean cruise but Ms Maitland adds: ""With the current travel bans, park closures and cruise cancellations, we're certainly starting to feel anxious about what is going to happen with our best-laid plans."" The couple, who live in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, say they are opting for a wait-and-see approach. ""More importantly, we remember to keep things in context. As important as our wedding is to us, and as excited as we are about our honeymoon, nothing is more important to us than the friends and family who we've invited to join us on that special day. ""As long as they all remain well and virus-free, then postponing or cancelling our plans doesn't really matter in the end. We just want everyone to be OK."" Meanwhile, also in London, Elisha Deol and her fiance Ronak Shah are trying to figure out contingency plans to make sure their wedding goes ahead in a few weeks. The couple, who have been engaged for just over a year, were due to have a Hindu wedding with 500 guests at the Oshwal Centre in Potters Bar next month, with a civil wedding and reception to follow at The Savoy hotel the next day. The whole event was set to cost around Â£100,000. Ms Deol said: ""There are a lot of things that concern us about the wedding going ahead. These include venues and suppliers cancelling on us at the last minute; the health and wellbeing of ourselves and our elderly and at-risk guests and the fact we have friends and family who were due to come from overseas."" She said guests from Canada, Kenya and the US had mostly all cancelled already. Ms Deol adds: ""We are currently in the process of writing to all suppliers asking them what their contingency plans are. ""It is so hard to know if we will get refunds, or even try to make any real plans as the picture is constantly changing.""",0,
142,Europe Is Waking Up From COVID-19 And Finding Itself In Economic Recession And Abuse Of Human Rights,Anonymous,"Europe is slowly waking up from the COVID-19 nightmare and finding itself in the biggest recession it ever faced before. They bombarded us with figures showing deaths and infected people, and we now see discussion about human rights abuses, economy figures, which results in social unrest and upheaval, at least in Germany and the Netherlands, the countries least affected, if we compare them with Italy, Spain and France. Italy and Spain got hit the hardest with COVID-19. Italy has one of the oldest populations in the world, but they got no help from their rich neighbors, EU countries like Germany and the Netherlands, but from Russia Cuba and China, which the EU's MSM regularly tried to portray as a propaganda stunt, and sure, Russia and Cuba would present the bill. These are words from the most capitalistic countries, once united in the EU, to blame countries who come to help. The opposite situation would be much worse, when the EU would come and help, the amounts they would ask would be staggeringly high. Wars in the Middle East are very costly for the EU, the US was forcing NATO to join in bombing Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and Syria.

94,"Mouthwash could protect against COVID-19 by destroying the outer layer of fat the virus uses to bind to human cells, scientists suggest",Jonathan Chadwick,"Mouthwash has the potential to protect against COVID-19 infection by killing the coronavirus before it can infect human cells, according to a new report. 

Coronaviruses belong to the class of 'enveloped viruses', meaning they are covered by a fatty layer that is vulnerable to certain chemicals. 

A team of international researchers say mouthwash could destroy the outermost layer or 'envelope' of the virus, preventing its replication in the mouth and throat.

The scientists say there is an urgent need to test the effectiveness of mouthwash in trials, although there is currently no clinical evidence that it would be successful. The World Health Organisation has already said: 'There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.' 

The study authors do not say that current commercially-available mouthwash prevents COVID-19, but that further research into mouthwash chemicals could be beneficial. Writing in Function, the study authors, led by Cardiff University, say oral rinses are an under-researched area of major clinical need’.

The team is backed by virologists, lipid specialists and healthcare experts from Cardiff University’s School of Medicine, along with the universities of Nottingham, Colorado, Ottawa, Barcelona and Cambridge’s Babraham Institute.   

'Safe use of mouthwash – as in gargling – has so far not been considered by public health bodies in the UK,' said lead author Professor O’Donnell, co-director of Cardiff University’s Systems Immunity Research Institute. 

'In test tube experiments and limited clinical studies, some mouthwashes contain enough of known virucidal ingredients to effectively target lipids in similar enveloped viruses.

'What we don’t know yet is whether existing mouthwashes are active against the lipid membrane of SARS-CoV-2. 

'Our review of the literature suggests that research is needed as a matter of urgency to determine its potential for use against this new virus.' 

'This is an under-researched area of major clinical need – and we hope that research projects will be quickly mobilised to further evaluate this.'  

Coronavirus is a type of enveloped virus, meaning it has an outer lipid membrane that could be damaged by chemicals in mouthwash. Naked viruses lack the viral envelope
Coronavirus is a type of enveloped virus, meaning it has an outer lipid membrane that could be damaged by chemicals in mouthwash. Naked viruses lack the viral envelope

The ingredients of dental mouthwashes, including chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine, all have the potential to prevent infection and several deserve clinical evaluation’, according to the researchers. 

In particular, these chemicals disrupt the outer lipid membrane, known as the viral envelope’ or lipid envelope’ of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.  

The lipid envelope helps several viruses, including coronaviruses, bind to human cells while avoiding the host immune system.

Specific spike proteins called glycoproteins’ on the surface of the envelope identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's cell membrane, which allows infection. 

Mouthwash chemicals could potentially modify the ability of the spike glycoproteins to interact with receptors on host cells.  

The researchers said there had so far been 'no discussion' about the potential role of damaging the fatty membrane as a possible way to inactivate the virus. 

The lipid envelope does not change when viruses mutate, meaning mouthwash could still work against any new coronavirus strains that emerge from this pandemic. 

The WHO has previously debunked the suggestion that mouthwash can prevent infection by SARS CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

'Some brands of mousthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth,' it said.

'However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV infection.'    ",1,
73,Operation COVID-19: Testing the Degree of “People’s Submission”. Activating our “Paranoia Switches”…,Dr. Pascal Sacré,"We are in a world that is globally flabbergasted today.

In other words, stunned, panicked.

Our brains are in a state of excessive, inordinate paranoia.

Our paranoia switches have been activated!

Martha Stout, an American psychologist, describes this in her book, “The Paranoia Switch“, published in 2007.

Our paranoia switch had already been activated on September 11, 2001.

Remember June 18, 2001? What you did, what you ate, the people you met, the TV program?

Not unless you were married that day. And again.

On the other hand, everyone remembers what they were doing on September 11, 2001, and especially what happened that day.

Not because everyone has a great memory or got married that day.

Because their paranoia switch has been turned to maximum.

I’m not going to lecture you on neuroscience or brain anatomy or brain amygdala or limbic system. In summary, the stronger a traumatic event is, especially visual, the more the cerebral amygdala, the centre of fear and aggressiveness, is stimulated and, above all, the less the hippocampus (centre of factual memory) and its relays with the higher centres of the brain (reflection) are operational and intact.

This means ?

After the traumatic event, even years later, any image, sound, word closely or remotely related to this event plunges us back into the same state of fear by activating the amygdala and depressing the hippocampus and our upper brain centres.

Basically, the “panicker”, freed from the control of the “analyst”, takes over the reins of our brain, and that’s not nice, that’s not good.

For example, the sound of a car horn in the street can immediately awaken intense paranoia in a war veteran that is completely disproportionate or even irrelevant, escaping reason.

Martha Stout points out that among all traumatic experiences, the ones that will cause the most astonishment and terror are those intentionally caused by our fellow human beings, such as rape, kidnapping, aggression or a terrorist attack, far ahead of those caused by accidents (explosion, car accident…) or natural disasters (earthquake…).

The important thing to remember is that once stunned in this way, the human brain no longer thinks, or thinks badly [with difficulty]. A bit like a short circuit in an electrical installation.

As a result, despite all its intelligence, its possible knowledge or its reflexes of critical analysis of a situation, the human brain becomes as if frozen.

It is mature, ready to submit.

Primary emotions such as fear, anger and aggression take control.

Such humans become very malleable, very suggestible and feel a strong urge to calm this fear by preferring simplistic speeches, ready-made solutions, even if they are irrational, impossible, illogical, by thinking it over.

But precisely!

Once the paranoia switch is turned on, people’s brains stop thinking.

The citizens are told all the official authorities’ lies that seem to them to be the providential solution, in this climate of extreme fear.

Could the powers that be, well aware of these psychological weaknesses of human beings, use our paranoia switches to keep their power and commit their misdeeds?

Martha Stout, in her excellent book, says:

“Agents of fear maintain their power by exploiting human weaknesses. »

History shows how those in power have always used fear to commit their misdeeds, often using a scapegoat of that fear to exonerate themselves and give the brain a bone to gnaw in the brain amygdala of the deceived populations.",1,
163,White Helmets use Covid-19 crisis to further US Coalition regime change agenda in Syria,Vanessa Beeley,"The White Helmet ‘coronavirus campaign’ is a cynical exploitation of the pandemic to weaponize it against the Syrian government. To really help the Syrians they should demand a lift of Western sanctions, not support them.
Five cases of coronavirus have now been reported by the health ministry in Syria. The country is subject to a curfew from 6pm to 6am as of March 25. Syria braces itself for a potential medical crisis. 

The Syrian healthcare sector has been crippled under a “maximum pressure” economic sanctions campaign that has collectively punished the Syrian people for the duration of a war waged against them by the same governments inflicting the catastrophic economic damage. Hospitals and medical care centers have been targeted and occupied by the extremist armed groups throughout Syria, further reducing the Syrian state-ability to deal with the looming threat of an apparently rapacious pandemic. 

Sanctions increase the risk of pandemic spread
All measures taken against the Syrian government by the UK, US and EU are ostensibly to “protect” the Syrian people. Of course sanctions never protect the people, they deprive the people of basic needs, they decimate essential infrastructure. They are designed to weaken the target state or leadership, to turn the people against the government, to serve US-led foreign policy agendas in the region. Sanctions enable war and destruction, they are taken to bring resistant nations into line with horrifying consequences for the civilian population. 


Instead of lifting sanctions to allow nations like Iran and Syria to combat what is described as a “global pandemic” that threatens the lives of all Syrians and Iranians according to the media hype – the US-led coalition of “humanitarian” intervention is effectively doubling down on their pro-sanction, pro-war rhetoric, as a recent statement from the UK, US, France and Germany has demonstrated. Former UK Ambassador to Syria, Peter Ford, described the statement as a thinly veiled cry of solidarity for Al-Qaeda in Syria, “There is not a word here with which Hayat Tahrir Ash Sham, the domiAnonymoust jihadi group, would not concur.”

White Helmets weaponize Covid-19 to ensure Syrian people suffer more
The Al-Qaeda-linked White Helmets group have sprung into action to defend the sanctions regime and to effectively condemn the huge majority of Syrian people to further misery should the pandemic take hold in Syria. An organisation with a history of collaboration with the US Coalition-sponsored armed groups in Syria, itself funded by the same governments, has been triggered by the billionaire-manufactured PR complex that manages and directs this shadow state construct.


We have seen a flurry of activity on their Twitter accounts, their primary platform, promoting the White Helmet “coronavirus” campaign. This is nothing short of cynical exploitation of a world crisis to weaponize it against the Syrian government via an entity that has served this purpose since its establishment, in Turkey, by a former British military intelligence officer, James Le Mesurier. 

The White Helmets have published a statement calling for sanctions against Syria to be maintained. The statement is based on misinformation and duplicitous narratives including the claim that Syria and Russia are deliberately targeting hospitals, omitting that these hospitals are invariably taken over by the Al Qaeda-dominated armed groups in areas they control – converted into terrorist triage centers, prisons, courts, military centers and torture chambers. 


Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was recently given a platform in the Senate to “[feed] the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the talking points that it should adopt.” Saleh’s highly politicized speech is echoed in his tweet, instrumentalising the coronavirus crisis to further amplify the talking points historically and fraudulently used to criminalize the Syrian government while airbrushing Nusra Front/Al-Qaeda from the Syrian conflict landscape. 


White Helmets are neither neutral nor humanitarian
So, in summary, the White Helmets, a supposedly “neutral” “humanitarian” organisation are sustaining their donors “maximum pressure” campaign against the Syrian people they claim to support. If the White Helmets were anything other than an extremist, propaganda construct implementing the US Coalition “regime change” policy against Syria, they would have demanded a ban on sanctions to enable the country to collectively deal with the coronavirus crisis. 


The White Helmet organisation should be condemned for effectively enabling mass suffering and death in Syria, not only by providing cover for internationally designated terrorist groups, but, now, for endorsing sanctions that will ensure the perfect conditions for a global pandemic to spread like wildfire through a “hybrid warfare”-decimated nation",1,
177,"Coronavirus Present on Fast Food Wrappers Across the US
",Now8News,"A startling discovery was made on Wednesday when scientists across the US dug deeper into the coronavirus pandemic. They sought out fast food items from all 50 states and tested them for COVID-19.

“38 out of the 50 states showed positive signs of COVID-19 on fast food wrappers and cups,” said Richard Schmitz of Harvard University Research Department. “This spread is only going to get worse, not better. This is going to kill millions faster than the fast food itself. These restaurants should not be open!”

But how long can the new coronavirus linger on surfaces, anyway? A new analysis found that the virus can remain viable in the air for up to 3 hours, on copper for up to 4 hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel up to 72 hours. This study was originally published in the preprint database medRxiv on March 11,  and now a revised version was published March 17 in The New England Journal of Medicine. 

What’s more, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on “a variety of surfaces” in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic people who were infected with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, up to 17 days after the passengers disembarked, according to a new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, this was before disinfection procedures took place and “data cannot be used to determine whether transmission occurred from contaminated surfaces,” according to the analysis. In other words, it’s not clear if the viral particles on these surfaces could have infected people.

Schmitz says he cannot emphasize enough how important it is right now to stay inside and cook your own food. “It’s the only way this thing is going to be contained. If we don’t, we are on track to far surpass the numbers of China and Italy combined.”",1,
217,The Campaign Against Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Sustained by Corrupt Medical Professionals with Ties to Big Pharma,Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,"The solution was another study by medical professionals some of whom have ties to Big Pharma and none of whom, apparently, are involved in the treatment of Covid patients.  The study lumps together people in different stages of the disease and undergoing different treatments. It touts its large sample, but many of the patients in the sample received treatment too late after the virus had reached their heart and other vital organs.  Most likely the people who died from heart failure died as a result of the virus, not from HCQ.  

To be effective treatment has to stop the virus early. Waiting until the patient must be hospitalized has given the virus too much of a head start. Every doctor, and there are many, who reports success with the HCQ treatment stresses early treatment.  President Trump used a two-week treatment with HCQ as a prophylactic as he was constantly coming into contact with people who tested positive for the virus.  Many medical professionals who are treating Covid patients also use HCQ as a prophylactic.

The Lancet study was a rush job as it was essential for Big Pharma to prevent the spread of the HCQ treatment and awareness of its safety and effectiveness. The study’s authors completed the data collection around the middle of April and the study was published on May 22.  As soon as it appeared, it was used to close down the World Health Organization’s clinical  trial of hydoxychloroquine in coronavirus patients citing safety concerns. Most likely, the trial was aborted in order to  prevent an official agency from finding out that HCQ worked.

The media, of course, used the suspended trial to cast more doubt on Trump’s judgment for recommending and using the treatment, the implication being that Trump had put himself at more risk from a heart attack than from the virus itself. 

The Daily Mail, which is often somewhat skeptical of official reports, even misreported French virologist Didier Raoult’s report (see this) of his success with treating 1,061 patients with HCQ/AZ as consisting of only a small sample of 30 patients (see this). A small sample is considered to be inconclusive. Thus 1,061 people became 30.

The Cost of Big Pharma’s COVID-19 Vaccine Will be Paid in Lives and in Billions of Dollars
The Lancet study claims a high mortality from HCQ treatment, reporting a death rate ranging from 5.1% to 13.8%.  In response to a journalist when asked about this claim, Didier Raoult said that he and has colleagues have followed 4,000 of their patients so far.  They have had 36 deaths and none from heart problems for a death rate of 0.009%.  According to The Lancet study, he should have between 204 and 552  patients dead from heart problems.  He has zero.  Raoult had more than 10,000 cardiograms analysed by rythmologists (a special kind of cardiologist) searching for any sign of heart problems.  

NIH’s Dr. Fauci denies that Raoult’s hard evidence is evidence.  On May 27 Fauci said, without showing shame of his ignorance or his lie, that there’s no evidence that shows the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is effective at treating COVID-19. (see this)

Perhaps what Fauci means is that no study undertaken by NIH or another Big Pharma friendly official body has been done and that only such studies constitute evidence.

When hard evidence such as Raoult’s is suppressed and misreported while “studies” doctored to produce a predetermined conclusion that serves Big Pharma profits are rushed into publication, we know that money has pushed ethics out of medical research.  A number of concerned people have been telling us this for some time.  We are past due to listen to them.

Private medicine is profit driven, which makes it susceptible to fraud.  In long ago days fraud was restrained by the moral character of doctors and the respect for truth of researchers.  These restraints, never perfect, have eroded as greed turned everything, integrity itself, into a commodity that is bought and sold.

The intent is to bury HCQ as a low cost effective treatment and to put in its place a high cost alternative whether effective or not, and to supplement this enhancement of profits with mass vaccination which might do us more harm than the virus itself.  Big Pharma could care less.  The only value it knows is profit.

This intent has garnered the support of the French, Belgium and Italian governments. Using The Lancet study and WHO’s termination of its HCQ trial as the excuse, the French government revoked its decree authorizing HCQ treatment. Belgium’s health ministry issued a warning against the use of HCQ except in registered clinical trials. Italy’s health agency wants HCQ’s use banned outside of clinical trials and suspended authorization to use HCQ as a Covid-19 treatment. See this.

Does this mean that Raoult and his team who by treating Covid patients with HCQ have achieved the remarkable low death rate of 0.009% are prohibited from using the proven cure to save lives? Will Raoult and his team be imprisoned if they continue to save lives? What about the people who will die from the three government’s prevention of a safe and effective treatment? Will France, Belgium, and Italy accept responsibility for these lost lives?

I can’t avoid wondering if the revolving door between Big Pharma and the NIH and CDC which corrupts US public health decisions also operates in France, Belgium and Italy. Are European health officials elevating themselves by climbing over the dead bodies of their victims?",1,

528,Coronavirus health warning: Obesity bigger risk than heart disease or diabetes | Express.co.uk,Lucy Johnston," It follows research showing obesity is a bigger risk factor for deadly complications of Covid-19 than heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes put together in the under-50s. At present those shielded include over-70s, people on immune suppressing drugs and with lung diseases. They also include people who have previously suffered from cancer - but this group does not so far appear to be at more risk. The public health focus has so far concentrated on protective measures from isolation and hand washing to healthy eating and exercise.  Dr Rajarshi Banerjee, from Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, believes obese people may be more at risk because their internal organs are damaged due to inflammation caused by fatty deposits. He has launched a study into patient recovery from Covid-19 to identify risk factors of the virus. Dr Banerjee said: ""Studies like these should inform our thinking as to who needs cocooning or shielding such as obese patients who have unseen and silent internal damage to their organs, such as liver and kidneys, putting them more at risk of complications. ""Research into this will likely be a key to understanding who are most at risk and perhaps the treatments that can help. Also it will help us decide if we isolate obese patients or those with fatty liver disease for longer. ""This plague of our times targets obesity and this is linked with inflammation in the liver and fatty liver disease which is more of a hidden problem affecting 20 per cent of the UK population."" Dr Banerjee's study, which begins next week, will be carried out by Perspectum, an Oxford-based healthcare and diagnostics company together with data from the UK genetic health resource UK Biobank to determine how much damage Covid-19 causes to patients' internal organs with particular focus on obese patients.  A new study from the US Center for Disease Control based on 99 counties and 14 states from March examined the underlying conditions of patients hospitalised with the virus to determine which risk factors led to the most severe disease. These included heart disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, obesity and high blood pressure. For those over 65 the biggest predictor of being hospitalised was high blood pressure, accounting for over 70 per cent, with heart disease accounting for half. About 60 per cent of hospital cases under the age of 50 were obese, compared with 18 per cent with high blood pressure, 19 per cent with diabetes and four per cent with cardiovascular disease. Obesity accounted for 50 per cent of hospitalisations in those aged 50-64 and 40 per cent in those aged over 65. Studies from the UK, US and Italy suggest hospitalisation rates for Covid-19 may escalate far more than in China because patients with fatty liver disease - associated with bad diet and excess weight - are at a much higher than average risk of complications of the virus. Research shows they also remain infectious for longer - 17 days rather than 12 days in patients without liver disease.

391,Man Utd news: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer makes Anthony Martial vow after Odion Ighalo transfer | Football | Sport | Express.co.uk,Matt Atherton," Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has heaped praise on striker Anthony Martial, as heâ€™s continued to fill in for the injured Marcus Rashford. But, the Frenchman will be given a break when he needs it, after United signed Odion Ighalo on loan from Shanghai Shenhua on transfer deadline day. Martial has been forced to play a leading role in Unitedâ€™s attack over recent weeks. Heâ€™s led the line for the Red Devils, after Rashford was injured in an FA Cup tie against Wolves last month. That left just Martial and youngster Mason Greenwood as recognised strikers in the squad. Solskjaer praised Martial for his dedication to the cause, and promised that the team wonâ€™t be relying on him as heavily after the signing of Ighalo. JUST IN: Man Utd factored coronavirus into Odion Ighalo transfer decision  â€œWeâ€™ll give him more support and give him rest when he Â­deserves it,â€ Solskjaer vowed. â€œHeâ€™s been asked to play too much as well, especially now when Â­Marcus is injured.â€ The United boss noted that Martialâ€™s work-rate has improved over the past 12 months, under Solskjaerâ€™s leadership. The manager has pulled Martial aside to let him know that heâ€™s delighted with his performances.

During that time, heâ€™s scored five goals, but hasnâ€™t provided any assists. Meanwhile, Ighalo signed on a six-month loan deal from Shanghai Shenhua in the final hour of transfer deadline day. United agreed to pay up to Â£4million in loan fees and wages to cover the deal. The Red Devils will be paying a third of his Â£300,000-a-week wages throughout his stay at Old Trafford. The former Watford striker last played in the Premier League in January 2017. He failed to score in his final 14 appearances for the Hornets, before sealing a mega-money move to China.

166,COVID-19 – THE FIGHT FOR A CURE: ONE GIGANTIC WESTERN PHARMA RIP-OFF,Peter Koenig,"And now, the chaotic western-style race of private corporations for a vaccine wanting to outdo one another, has begun.

Who is first to develop a vaccine? – It’s a fierce competition to establish a patent, a monopoly – for a possibly multi trillion-dollar business. Its western neoliberal capitalism at its very worst – or best, depending on the angle from where one looks.

There are no words to describe this chaotic fever for profit over human wellbeing. It has nothing to do with health, with healing sick and suffering, possibly dying people. It’s all about money. Hundreds of billions, if not trillion of profit for the pharmaceutical oligarch and their associated research laboratories and enterprises. And even more so, if the WHO-declared “pandemic” (sic) will prompt a forced vaccination campaign, enhanced by military and police surveillance.

Let’s put COVID-19 in context. As of 23 March 2020 (18:33 GMT), and according to WHO statistics, reported worldwide cases are 372,572; deaths 16,313; recovered 101,373 – a death rate of 4.37%. However, these figures must be considered with caution. In many countries, especially developing economies, accurate testing may be a problem. Test kits are often not available, or not reliable. So, may people who go to the doctor with some flu symptoms are possibly falsely diagnosed as COVID-19 victims, as it serves the publicity hype.

Miscalculations and false reporting may even occur in the United States. Mr. Robert Redfield, CEO of the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), testified before Congress that CDC does no longer carry out regular tests, that these were carried out at State-level and only in extreme cases. See also this reference form the LA Times of California measures and directives.

 

By comparison, the US CDC estimates that in the 2019 / 2020 flu season in the US alone, some 38 to 54 million people may catch the common flu, and 23,000 to 59,000 may die from it. The vast majority of these deaths will be elderly people above 70-years of age and many of them with pre-health conditions and /or pre-existing respiratory problems. This is pretty much the same disease and death pattern as with COVID-19. Expanding these common flu figures linearly on a worldwide scale would result in hundreds of thousands of flu deaths. In the particularly strong 2017-2018 US flu season, an estimated 60,000 people died from the flu in the US alone. The reader may himself judge whether WHO was justified declaring COVID-19 a “pandemic” — or whether there may have been – just perhaps – another agenda behind it?

The vaccine that might eventually be applied to COVID-19, may most likely no longer be valid for the next coronavirus outbreak – which, also according to Mr. Redfield, CDC, will most probably occur. A later virus may most certainly have mutated. It’s quite similar to the common flu virus. In fact, the annually reoccurring common flu virus contains a proportion of 10% to 15% (some times more) of coronaviruses.

The effectiveness of the annual flu vaccines is on average less than 50%, not to mention all the potential harmful side effects, they carry along. COVID-19 is very similar to influenza. Will a corona virus vaccine be equally weak in protecting a potential patient from a future infection?

Cooperation instead of competition, doesn’t occur in the west. It’s all profit-driven. With a number of different vaccines from different pharma giants coming on the market, who will tell the patient which one is the best, most suitable for the patient’s condition? It smells like an utter chaotic scam.

The real question is – are vaccines – or a vaccine – even necessary? Maybe – maybe not. The production of vaccines is pushed for profit motives and for an important political agenda for a New World Order – that has been planned to change human life as we know it, or thought we knew it. See further explanations below.

Vaccines don’t heal, they may prevent the virus from hitting as hard as it might otherwise do, or not at all, depending on the age, physical and health condition of a person. Worldwide statistics show that usually a person up to the age of 40 or 50, who is infected by the COVID-19, has none or only slight symptoms, nothing to worry about.

Should symptoms show up, staying home, resting and using traditional, age-old medicine, the same that might be used for the common flu, might be enough to get rid of the virus. This might resolve the disease within one or two weeks. Then, the person will be naturally “vaccinated” against this strand of coronavirus. Elderly people above 65 or 70 may be more at risk and special attention may be in order – separated from crowds, isolation during a two-week quarantine (the incubation period), while the rest of society goes on with life as normal as possible, thereby reducing the huge cost to society.


 
China has brought the COVID-19 pandemic under control without a vaccine, but using common sense and traditional, rather inexpensive medication. What are these regular medicines that are effective and have helped to bring COVID-19 under control in China, without a vaccine?

The “Children’s Health Defense” (the Children’s Defense Fund – CDF), an American NGO, founded 1973 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., depicts the current power struggle in France between health official and the country’s leading experts in virology, as representative for the worldwide fight between corporate pharma supported by (bought) governments and international organizations, such as WHO – and renowned scientists. If laid open, it is an eye-opener. See full CDF study.

French Professor Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top 5 scientists on communicable diseases, argued that the approach of mass quarantine is both inefficient and outdated and that large-scale testing and treatment of suspected cases achieves far better results.

Early on, Dr. Raoult suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (Chloroquine or Plaquenil), a well-known, simple, and inexpensive drug, also used to fight Malaria, and that has shown efficacy with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. By mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce the viral load and bring spectacular improvement. The Chinese scientists published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend Chloroquine in their new guidelines to treat Covid-19.

COVID-19 – The Fight for a Cure: One Gigantic Western Pharma Rip-Off

In addition, China and Cuba are working together with the use of Interferon Alpha 2B, a highly efficient anti-viral drug developed in Cuba some 39 years, but little known to the world, because of the US imposed embargo on anything from Cuba. Interferon has also proven to be very effective in fighting COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint-venture in China.

Chinese researchers in cooperation with Cuban scientists are also developing a vaccine which may soon be ready for testing. In contrast to the west, working exclusively on profit-motives, the Chinese-Cuban vaccine would be made available at low cost to the entire world.

Other simple, but effective remedies include the use of heavy doses of Vitamin C, as well as Vitamin D3, or more generally the use of Micronutrients essential to fight infections, include vitamins A, B, C, D, and E. Another remedy that has been used for thousands of years by ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians, are Colloidal silver products. They come in forms to be administered as a liquid by mouth, or injected, or applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products are boosting the immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and have been used for treating cancer, HIV/AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye ailments, prostatitis – and COVID-19.

Yet another simple and inexpensive remedy, to be used in combination with others, is menthol-based “Mentholatum”. It’s used for common flu and cold symptoms. Rubbed on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs to enter the respiratory track.

Northern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and be put 24×7 on a 90% strength respirator, with some of them remaining unresponsive, going into respiratory failure. The reported death rate is about 40%. The condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. That means the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to “sleep sitting up” until they are cured. This helps drain the liquid out of the lungs. The method has been known to work successfully since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic.

As you may expect, if you look up any of these alternative cures on internet – internet controlled by Google and the Big Corporatocracy, including the pharmaceuticals, will logically advise you against using them. At best they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven effective, and at worst, that they may be harmful. Don’t believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember, some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And remember, China has successfully come to grips with COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive medications.

Unfortunately, few doctors are aware of these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. They are safe and more often than not successful. The media, under pressure from the pharma giants and the compliant government agencies, have been requested to censoring such valuable information. The negligence or failure, to make such easily accessible remedies public knowledge is killing people.

Now, let’s cut to the chase, to what’s behind it all – behind the extraordinary monstrous media propaganda hype that is bringing down the entire (western) world’s socioeconomic system, creating untold misery, famine, and death. A misery with suffering potentially by orders of magnitude worse than the Big Depression of 1928 / 1929 and the subsequent years.

If anybody had any doubts up to now, where the virus originated, the truth was dropped surreptitiously, a slip of the tongue or on purpose, by Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when he addressed the Nation on 21 March on COVID-19, he said, “This is not about retribution, we are in a live exercise here…”, meaning military exercise, or a war game. This live (military) exercise has unimaginable worldwide implications which may completely transform our lives. It’s economic warfare. Almost every country on this planet is on some kind of a lock-down, a quarantine of sorts for an as of yet undetermined period, with businesses closed, shops and restaurants shot, construction sites halted, people working from home if they can, being in the streets is forbidden, in many countries under police and military surveillance, with cases of people being beaten up and hand-cuffed, if they have no good explanation.

The President Macron-inspired French police is especially known for its uncontrolled brutality fighting the Yellow Vests. They have already demonstrated their same despise for their fellow citizens, when they are in the streets, even food shopping, without a special permit. Borders are shot, airlines are grounded, tourism comes to a screeching halt, basically from one day to the other, stranded throughout the world. With a few exceptions, Germany and France are rare ones, they organize return flights for their citizens abroad. Otherwise, with uncertain flight departures, over-booked and over-crowded flights, the stranded tourists have hardly a chance to return home soon.

The socioeconomic cost is astronomical. In the multi-quadrillion, or quintillion; numbers with so many zeros they make you dizzy. This calamity can only partly be valued with numbers, and not now, as the world’s lock-down continues – with a social cost that cannot be valued. The dive of the stock market by about 30% – a typical boAnonymousza for forward speculators and Big FiAnonymousce, Big Banking, with multi-trillion-dollar losses for the small investors.

Millions, if not hundreds of millions of small and medium size businesses going broke, unemployment going rampant, in the hundreds of millions, throughout the world, and the poorest of the poor, especially in developing countries, who are either unemployed or survive on small hourly or day-to-day jobs – they have no income, cannot buy the basics for survival – some of them may die from famine, others may commit suicide, others convert to crime. This is Greece by a factor of thousand, or worse.

Then, there is a moral and societal breakdown from a forced quarantine, for which there is no clear end in sight. This creates fear and anxieties, frustration and anger.  For many it’s like solitary confinement – all of which is bad for health, and lowers the immune defense system. Just what those who pull the strings want.

So, whom does this live (military) exercise serve? – First one would assume its destined to break China’s back, as China is the up-and-coming economic power. It is true, China’s economy has suffered enormously, with about 60% to 70% of all production stopped for the first two months this year, the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and peak, meaning a significant plunge of China’s GDP, maybe as much as 40% for January and February 2020.

However, China has the corona virus now firmly under control. And China being China, her economy is recovering fast and may soon be back to what it was in December 2019. In fact, despite the significant impact of COVID-19, China’s economy may soon overtake that of the self-styled empire, the United States of America. China’s currency the yuan, is solidly backed by a strong economy and by gold, and is slated to become the world’s chief reserve currency, replacing the US-dollar, which had that role for the last 100 years. When that happens, the US hegemony is doomed.

It’s more. This attack on China is actually backfiring big time. China is the supply chain for almost everything for the west. To increase corporate profits, the US and other western countries have outsourced almost everything to low-cost labor China. This concerns not only high technology electronics, but also medication and medical equipment. About 80% and ingredients to produce medication come from China. For antibiotics the proportion is about 90%.
With much of Chinese production halted for almost 2 months, the delivery lag is enormous.

A plan has been on the drawing board for the last few years, dictated by the obscure clan, or “Deep Dark State”, and designed by its minions, who expect to be generously rewarded in one way or another. Or, you may put it this way, the absence of punishment and torture is also a form of reward.

Universal Vaccination

First, there is an enormous drive towards universal vaccination, because vaccination will be the cornerstone of all that follows, namely a universally imposed electronic identification of every person on the planet. And what is best suited to force down a vaccination program? – A pandemic, of course, with people being made more scared every day. The fear factor is key. It is being increased by a time-undetermined quarantine and by a constant drip-by-drip indoctrination of bad news on the COVID-19 front. Every day the pace of increasing numbers of infected people and those who died, accelerates, increasing fear and anxiety.

The time will come, when people will literally scream for help. They want a police and military state to protect them – from the virus, I guess – and they want to be vaccinated. They don’t care nor ask what is the cocktail that is being injected in their body and what its long-term implications may be. For example, the vaccination cocktail could serve to reduce women and men’s fertility, or cause long-term neurological defects that can even be passed on to next generations.  People with fear just want to sleep at ease, being vaccinated. They don’t care – nor do they want to know – that along with the vaccine could be a Anonymouso-chip injected that will contain all their personal data, from health records to bank accounts – and can be electronically remote-controlled. It goes without saying, our monetary system is planned to be fully electronic, no more cash – cash is poison – or as WHO’s Director General recently warned, not verbatim, but with that meaning, cash is dangerous for infections, paper money and coins may carry deadly viruses – thereby paving the way for full digitization of our monetary system. This has, indeed, already been tested over the past few years, mainly in Scandinavian countries, where entire department stores refuse to accept cash. In response to the WHO DG’s recommendation, some shops and restaurants in Germany refuse to accept cash.

The universal vaccination and electronic ID go together and will first be tested in a few developing countries. Bangladesh is one of them. The vaccination program is the platform for the mega-changes the New World Order (NOW), or the One World Order (OWO) wants to bring about. This, in addition to the enormous money-making boAnonymousza.

An almost unknown agency called Agenda ID2020 is behind all this, monitoring, directing and adjusting the implementation of the various programs – that are supposed to eventually lead to Full Spectrum DomiAnonymousce. For more details, see also the recent article on the dangers of Agenda ID2020.

Behind this elaborate and complex network of things, appears time and again, one prominent name: Bill Gates, the Bill and Melinda Gate’s Foundation. Bill Gates has been funding vaccination programs in Africa for decades. And Bill Gates and the Rockefellers make no secret that one of their ultimate goal for planet earth is a drastic population reduction.

Abstract of Agenda ID2020

Agenda ID2020 – is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It’s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity.

GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry.

The ID2020 Alliance at their 2019 Summit, entitled “Rising to the Good ID Challenge”, in September 2019 in New York, decided to roll out their program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the WEF in January 2020 in Davos. Their digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and “partners from academia and humanitarian relief” (as they call it), are part of the pioneer party.

Is it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what WHO calls a Pandemic? – Or is a pandemic needed to ‘roll out’ the multiple devastating programs of ID2020?

How the Vaccination Research and Production is supposed to work.

How will this elaborate and complex business of creating vaccines and implementing vaccine campaign work? As most official activities that basically are government responsibilities are privatized and outsourced, they become complex, chaotic at times and inefficient. In the case of the west, the US pretends to take the lead, but will also assign responsibilities to European pharma-labs.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) has overall responsibility for national health research and program implementation. NIH’s Director is Anthony Fauci. The Institute was created in 1955. Under NIH, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of 27 institutes, reporting to NIH, is responsible for vaccination programs. NIAD’s mission is to conduct basic and applied research to better understand, treat and prevent infectious, immunologic and allergic diseases. NIAD has outsourced the vaccination program to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

CEPI was formed by the WEF (World Economic Forum) in Davos in January 2017. It was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the London-based Welcome Trust, created in 1936, but including now as members several European countries and the European Union (EU). The BMGF made a first infusion to CEPI of US$ 460 million. CEPI also receives funding from Norway and India and is also heavily supported by the pharma-industry.

According to CEPI’s website, CEPI has appealed for US$ 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and to expand the number of vaccine candidates to increase the chances of success and to fund the clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. CEPI’s ambition is to have at least three vaccine candidates, which could be submitted to regulatory authorities for licensing for general use/use in outbreaks.

“Governments around the world will need to invest billions of euros more in coronavirus vaccine development, to take forward some promising candidates that are emerging.  – It’s a very risky business – everything is being done in parallel, you’re not building on the expertise of others – but good progress is being made,” said Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI.

CEPI has already some preselected international pharma corporations to research and work on a COVID-19 vaccine. They include the biotech “Moderna” in Seattle, not far from the Microsoft Headquarters – also a Bill Gates creation; the biotech lab Inovio, the University of Queensland, Australia, and the Germans, BioNTech and CureVac.

From the outset it looks that Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech are best suited to produce fast a vaccine, because according to a Health and Science report, published on March 17, 2020, “all three of these firms specialize in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics. These mRNA molecules are used to instruct the body to produce its own immune response to fight a range of different diseases. This type of vaccine can potentially be developed and produced more quickly than traditional vaccines.”

COVID-19 – The Fight for a Cure: One Gigantic Western Pharma Rip-OffEnters GAVI – the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has also been created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations, dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry. GAVI has already announced it needs billions of dollars to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. In June 2020, the UK Government will sponsor a donor conference in support of GAVI’s COVID-19 vaccination program, expecting to raise US$ 7.3 billion.

From this maze of overlapping organizations, activities and unclear responsibilities, the money-flow is likely going to be a crisscross that nobody can follow. Accountability on a large scale will be lost.

As to the output – hopefully a vaccine – or several vaccines. For the layman and potential patient, it will be a matter of luck (or bad luck) what cocktail of biological substances will be injected into his or her body. In any case, the long-term outcome, is unpredictable. Remember, Bill Gates has been pursuing during the last fifteen or twenty years his own very special agenda. It is unlikely he will abandon it now. Rather COVID-19 and the ensuing vaccination program will allow him to enhance it.

Concluding – it is amply clear that this is a huge money-making and public-rip-off proposition by the pharma industry. What makes this multi-billion-dollar scam even worse, is that it has an official rubber-stamp, by being supported by western governments and international organizations, foremost WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.

This may be the last opportunity for the elite, the 0.1%, to shuffle social capital and worker funded assets from the bottom to the top, before we enter an era of total control through electromagnetic fields (EMF), managed by the minions of the 0.1% and with 5G / 6G technology, where we, the remaining humans may have become mere tele-guided robots.

It is by now a pipe dream to believe that the world may continue as it did until the end of the last decade. It would be too much of a coincidence that Agenda ID2020 started activating its evil programs exactly at the beginning of the decade 2020. Unfortunately, it is also a far-away dream that China and Cuba could lead the way for finding a cure for the most likely recurring coronavirus in one mutation or another – including but not exclusively, using traditional methods and remedies that have proven successful in the current battle to control COVID-19.

There are draconian measures on the way, and we may just pray that they fail, or that we, the people, awake in time and in sufficient numbers – a critical mass – and find back to our innermost voice and soul – solidarity for each other that gives us strength to fight this Luciferian monster.",1,
537,"Dollar falls after Fed QE, on fiscal stimulus hopes",,"The dollar fell broadly on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday committed to buy an unlimited amount of bonds and as investors were optimistic the American government would pass a stimulus package to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar fell 0.42% to 101.71. It is down from a more than three-year high of 102.99 on Friday. ""The Fed's measures are unprecedented, and they have been extremely proactive in preventing this external shock from morphing into a wider funding crisis,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, head of FX strategy at Lombard Odier. The Fed on Monday announced various programs, including purchases of corporate bonds, guarantees for direct loans to companies and a plan to get credit to small and medium-sized business. While the Fed's latest measures were seen to have effectively broken the spreading freeze in the dollar funding markets in the short term, the shock to the real economy is expected to last for a far longer period. The U.S. Senate could pass a $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package as soon as Tuesday, negotiators said, which analysts say is needed to blunt the economic harm from business shutdowns. Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of foreign exchange and commodity research at Commerzbank, said in a note that, as more economies enact draconian measures to lock down their economies, the global economy would be massively constrained in the near future and markets could quickly turn back into risk-off mode. ""While we think that most currencies will eventually regain much of the ground that they have recently lost to the U.S.dollar, we don't expect that process to start until the pandemic has clearly passed its worst,"" Oliver Allen, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. Against the dollar, the euro jumped 0.82% to $1.0809. Some more relief was also evident in dollar funding markets, with measures of short-term funding indicators such as euro-dollar FX swaps for three-month maturities stabilizing around 8 basis points after blowing out to more than 100 bps last week. The British pound also rose 1.72% to $1.1747, up from a 35-year low of $1.1413 set last week. The Australian dollar gained 1.53% to $0.5916, extending its recovery from a 17-year low of $0.5510 last week.",0,
492,Aryaka Business Productivity Solution Supports Flood of Telecommuters and Students Requiring Access to Australia HQ and Campus Resources,,"Global health concerns created by the Coronavirus have led to the largest remote workforce and student population in history and, in many cases, these individuals cannot return to their communities. Though a resolution may potentially take months, employees must remain productive and students must continue their studies. However, this sudden influx of remote users can lead to overcrowded VPNs and non-optimized CDNs creating a poor application performance for end-users. Aryaka, the cloud-first WAN company and #1 end-to-end managed SD-WAN provider, announced today a unique solution for these overloaded connections, leveraging the companys global private backbone and requiring no architecture changes by the customer. The solution includes two different capabilities. The first, Aryakas Secure Remote Access (SRA), routes all of the organizations network traffic through a dedicated, SLA-driven global Layer-2 private backbone unencumbered by public internet traffic. The result is an improvement in application performance and an increase in remote worker productivity by up to 10x due to management of packet loss, latency and jitter. SRA also enables students to better access university resources if connecting via a VPN. The second solution leverages the Aryaka SmartCDN, which accelerates application and content delivery if a university posts content to the web. In this case, no VPN is required. Most organizations offer some type of remote access solution, but they were never designed for Ëœpeak capacity, meaning to scale for the present situation where employees or students are required to work from a location distant from their corporate HQ or university campus, said Mario Vecchio, senior vice president of APAC, Aryaka. As the impact of this health crises stretches out, Aryaka has an easy-to-implement solution that ensures continued productivity and collaboration. For organizations already struggling to accommodate the sharp increase in remote VPN access, Aryakas solutions can be implementedremotelyin minutes, without any hardware or software requirements.

The carrier has grounded most of its planes because of the fall in demand, flying only a skeleton network to major destinations such as Beijing, Los Angeles, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and Vancouver in April and May that represents just 3% of normal capacity. In a statement, Cathay said it was communicating with the affected crew in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as their union. Last month it announced the closure of its Vancouver cabin crew base, with 147 crew, as part of a business review. On Thursday, Cathay said it was exploring all available options to ride out the storm and doing all it could to preserve cash. One day this week, it had carried just 302 passengers, compared to around 100,000 on a typical day. Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Clarence Fernandez",0,
496,Victoria Beckham receives backlash after putting 30 workers on furlough 'Had to be done' | Celebrity News | Showbiz & TV | Express.co.uk,Samantha Masters," As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread across the UK, fashion mogul Victoria Beckham, 46, has put 30 members of her staff on the Governmentâ€™s furlough scheme. Staff members at her fashion label have been told they will be paid 80 per cent of their salaries by the Government. We have made the decision to furlough a proportion of staff on an enhanced package Victoria Beckham spokesperson Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced the scheme to help businesses during the pandemic. Businesses can claim 80 per cent of their employees' wages from the Government, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per person, per month before tax. The company can top up this pay if it chooses to. A representative for Victoria told Express.co.uk: â€œWe are working hard to ensure our much-valued VB team are protected during this unsettled time by keeping our business healthy. READ MORE: James Martin: Saturday Morning host talks 'complex' problem   â€œHaving carefully assessed all our options, we have made the decision to furlough a proportion of staff on an enhanced package.â€ The former Spice Girl is understood to be paying the remaining 20 per cent to her workers, although she is not obliged to do so, according to Daily Mail online. It is believed Victoriaâ€™s staff will be furloughed for â€œtwo months so farâ€. The scheme could help cover the wage bill for the 30 staff until the end of June.   A source has also told The Sun on Sunday: â€œLike many, Victoria has reluctantly had to furlough staff members. â€œIt wasnâ€™t a decision she took lightly but, for the long-term stability and profitability of the company, it had to be done. â€œShe has been personally keeping all her team involved with emails the whole way through, and has put all of the staff involved on enhanced furlough packages. â€œShe has even forgone her own salary in order to lead from the front.â€ DON'T MISS...Louise Minchin speaks out on 'problem' in new move: 'I'm exhausted' [ADMISSION]James Jordan and wife Ola Jordan speak out about parenting problem [PARENTING]Steph McGovern reignites decade-long feud with Bill Turnbull [DEBATE] Victoriaâ€™s hand bag collection alone is said to be worth a Â£1.5 million.

390,Coronavirus outbreak begins to disrupt booming China drug trials - Reuters,"Tamara Mathias, Roxanne Liu, Manojna Maddipatla","(Reuters) - The fast-spreading coronavirus is starting to disrupt testing of experimental medicines in China, posing a threat to plans by global drugmakers that have invested billions of dollars to harness the potential of the Asian economic powerhouse. The U.S. clinical trials database lists nearly 500 studies with a site in the city of Wuhan, which has endured the brunt of an outbreak that has killed more than 1,100 people and infected more than 44,000 in China. About 20% of global trials are now conducted in China, up from about 10% just five years ago, according to GlobalData Plc. China has imposed a virtual lockdown on Wuhan and severely restricted travel in its wider province of Hubei and some other cities. While it is too early in the outbreak first detected in December to fully assess its impact on clinical trials, if it goes on much longer the pharmaceutical industryâ€™s China strategy is likely to be disrupted. Virus-curbing efforts by the government have made it difficult for trial patients to reach hospitals running studies, according to interviews with two contract research organizations that conduct trials for drugmakers, local drug companies and doctors. Others fear becoming infected if they return to a healthcare facility for a trial. â€œHospitals arenâ€™t focused on clinical trials right now,â€ said Ian Woo, president and chief financial officer of Everest Medicines, which is developing drugs for the Chinese market. â€œThey have plenty of other things to be focused on.â€ The outbreak has delayed the launch of new studies, and research organizations like dMed Biopharmaceutical Co said they have been unable to send staff to monitor trial sites. Affected ongoing studies include trials testing a Novartis medicine for a rare blood disorder, a cancer drug from BeiGene Ltd and a treatment for a type of spinal arthritis from Chinese drugmaker Tasly Pharmaceutical Group, according to doctors involved. Beijing-based BeiGene, which has more than 20 trials ongoing in Wuhan, said it was working to minimize potential delays and disruptions, but that it was â€œtoo early to speculate on any specific impact on our clinical trial and commercial progress in China.â€ Other drugmakers with trials in China, including Roche, Zai Lab Ltd and Hutchison China MediTech Ltd (Chi-Med), also said it was too soon to speculate on the outbreakâ€™s consequences. But the impact is being felt. Shenghao Tu, who is working on the Tasly clinical trial in Wuhan, said the study in his hospital has been suspended. â€œThis is a problem that (we) never encountered before,â€ Tu said. The issue is not limited to Wuhan. Two doctors testing the BeiGene cancer drug tislelizumab in Beijing and Guangzhou city said efforts to contain the virus have hampered patient enrollment and capacity. Both their hospitals now require that each room hold only one patient to prevent cross-infection, reducing the number  they can accommodate. The delays are disrupting a booming, homegrown pharmaceutical industry China hopes will supply its domestic market and compete globally. International drugmakers including Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc, Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding, U.S. biotech Amgen Inc and Switzerlandâ€™s Novartis AG have made big investments, hoping to benefit from cheaper trial costs in China, access to large patient populations and the ability to identify new drugs for Asian markets. Amgen last year agreed to pay $2.7 billion for a 20.5% stake in BeiGene to develop cancer drugs for the Chinese market. A few weeks later, BeiGene in November became the first drugmaker to receive U.S. approval for a cancer therapy based on trials conducted largely in China. Amgen research chief David Reese said at the time BeiGene has built â€œone of the premier clinical trial platforms in China,â€ noting its strong relationships with trial investigators and regulators. Deals and joint ventures between international companies and China-based biotechs surged to at least $10 billion in 2019, from about $3.2 billion in 2015, according to a Reuters analysis of GlobalData information. (Graphic: China's growing global drug development footprint, here) BeiGeneâ€™s chief advisor Eric Hedrick sees the potential for more lucrative deals for his company. â€œWe think that there are other companies out there, like Amgen, who have the same sort of ambitions where BeiGene would make a good partner,â€ Hedrick said in an interview prior to the outbreak. The surge in investment followed years of effort by Chinese regulators to elevate healthcare facilities to match global standards and increase the role China-run trials play in U.S. and European drug approval decisions. Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments who created a fund that tracks the Chinese pharmaceutical industry, said the epidemic could delay deals in the short run. Longer term, investors expect the outbreak will prompt China â€œto accelerate its plans to really modernize its drug and healthcare sector,â€ he said. Amgen said it had not yet seen disruptions to BeiGene operations. Novartis said it was monitoring the situation and would handle any disruptions. Tasly declined comment. Much will depend on how long the outbreak lasts, particularly for trials set to begin later this year and ongoing studies that will take years to complete. Chi-Med Chief Executive Christian Hogg was optimistic about a resolution. â€œThis a relatively new phenomenon ... and China is a resourceful country,â€ he said. Roche, which last year opened a drug development center in Shanghai, sees China as key to its strategy to get new treatments to the global market. â€œYou can imagine the large number of patients (in China),â€ Jing He, head of Rocheâ€™s Shanghai pharmaceutical development center, told Reuters. â€œWe will be able to enroll patients faster.â€ For now, that may not be the case. A doctor working on a study of Novartisâ€™ eltrombopag for severe aplastic anemia who asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak with media, told Reuters the trial could be slowed due to patient recruiting obstacles.    Some patients are not allowed to travel from their cities to qualified hospitals for required screening procedures, he said.

329,"'Think months, not weeks' UK lockdown won't end soon reveals Oliver Dowden | UK | News | Express.co.uk",Claire Anderson," Britain's coronavirus lockdown has been extended for a further three weeks with no end date in sight as calls come for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to set out an exit strategy. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden explained appropriate measures will be put in place when it is safe to do so but the current evidence is consistent with Mr Johnson's first suggestion that the lockdown could last for three months. It comes as the number of hospital deaths of people who tested positive for COVID-19 passed 16,000, with a further 596 announced on Sunday. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dowden said: ""The first step would understand whether it is safe to ease the current restrictions that's how we'll apply the five-fold test. ""Then based on the evidence, we'll take appropriate measures. ""We said right at the beginning of this and the Prime Minister said he expected this peak to last around three months. ""What's happened is kind of consistent with that. READ MORE: 'Call 999!'

Host Nick Robinson added: ""Think it terms of months, not weeks. ""I think is the pretty clear message you're sending to us now."" It comes as Mr Dowden said he was hopeful a promised package of 84-tonnes of PPE would arrive from Turkey on Monday after being delayed on Sunday. He told BBC One's Breakfast show there had been ""challenges"" in acquiring the consignment, which includes 400,000 gowns.  He said: ""We are very hopeful that later today that flight will take off and we will get those gowns."" ""We are working very hard to resolve this, there have been challenges at the Turkish end. ""I don't want to start making more and more promises but I understand that that flight will take off this afternoon and they will be delivered.""

411,Scientists were close to a SARS coronavirus vaccine years ago.,,"Dr. Peter Hotez says he made the pitch to anyone who would listen. After years of research, his team of scientists in Texas had helped develop a vaccine to protect against a deadly strain of coronavirus. Now they needed money to begin testing it in humans. But this was 2016. More than a decade had passed since the viral disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, had spread through China, killing more than 770 people. That disease, an earlier coronavirus similar to the one now sweeping the globe, was a distant memory by the time Hotez and his team sought funding to test whether their vaccine would work in humans. ""We tried like heck to see if we could get investors or grants to move this into the clinic,"" said Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""But we just could not generate much interest."" That was a big missed opportunity, according to Hotez and other vaccine scientists, who argue that SARS, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, of 2012, should have triggered major federal and global investments to develop vaccines in anticipation of future epidemics. Read more from NBC News: Are coronavirus diseases equally deadly? Top hospital braces for coronavirus pandemic with secret warehouse full of emergency supplies Gas act: Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida wears mask for coronavirus vote Instead, the SARS vaccine that Hotez's team created in collaboration with scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston is sitting in a freezer, no closer to commercial production than it was four years ago. ""We could have had this ready to go and been testing the vaccine's efficacy at the start of this new outbreak in China,"" said Hotez, who believes the vaccine could provide cross-protection against the new coronavirus, which causes a respiratory disease known as COVID-19. ""There is a problem with the ecosystem in vaccine development, and we've got to fix this."" Hotez will take that message to Congress on Thursday, when he's scheduled to testify before the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He plans to argue that the new coronavirus should trigger changes in the way the government funds vaccine development. ""It's tragic that we won't have a vaccine ready for this epidemic,"" Hotez wrote in prepared remarks he shared with NBC News. ""Practically speaking, we'll be fighting these outbreaks with one hand tied behind our backs."" As of Wednesday, there had been more than 94,000 confirmed coronavirus cases globally and about 3,200 deaths. Public health officials are concerned that the virus, which can lead to respiratory failure brought on by pneumonia, will spread widely in the U.S. and last beyond this year â€” much like the seasonal flu, but more severe and potentially deadlier. In response, pharmaceutical companies, university researchers and the federal government have been rushing to develop a vaccine. In addition to the official government effort led by the National Institutes of Health, several drugmakers are also scrambling to develop a vaccine that can be tested in humans in the coming months. But even under the rosiest of projections, one won't be ready for more than a year, government officials say. ""I'm cautiously optimistic that we will get a vaccine,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health's director for infectious diseases, said in an interview this week. ""The thing that's sobering is that it's not a vaccine we're going to have next month, so we're going to have to tough it out through this evolution."" Early efforts to develop a SARS vaccine in animal trials were plagued by a phenomenon known as ""vaccine-induced enhancement,"" in which recipients exhibit worse symptoms after being injected â€” something Fauci said researchers must be mindful of as they work to quickly develop a vaccine to protect against COVID-19. That kind of research â€” figuring out which vaccine strategies work and which don't â€” potentially could have been completed before the new outbreak, said Jason Schwartz, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health who studies vaccine development. He said the global response to the coronavirus exposes broader flaws in the way medical research is funded, which he says tends to be market-driven and reactive, rather than proactive. ""We have a pattern in our medical research landscape in which outbreaks lead to a surge in research investment, and if and when those outbreaks wane, as they invariably do, other priorities take their place,"" Schwartz said. ""As a result, you lose those opportunities to capitalize on that initial investment, and the cycle starts over again."" The responsibility to fund this type of research must rest with governments and nonprofits, Schwartz said, because for-profit pharmaceutical companies can't be counted on to fund projects that, in most cases, will never make money. Some progress was made in the wake of the West Africa Ebola outbreak that ended in 2016. It spurred global leaders to create the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, a private-public partnership that's based in Norway and funded in part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The nonprofit group has poured millions of dollars into vaccine development, but Schwartz and other experts say more is needed. ""We need to make sure that there are incentives outside of our traditional business model that can lead to greater investments in that foundational research,"" Schwartz said. Dr. James LeDuc, director of the Galveston National Laboratory, said work has resumed on the SARS vaccine that his researchers helped develop with Hotez's team. The laboratory, a high-security biocontainment facility on Texas' Gulf Coast, received a live sample of the new coronavirus last month and will use it to test the vaccine in mice. But first the lab must breed a colony of mice genetically engineered to replicate the human disease, a process that LeDuc said will take months. ""I think we as a nation and as a society need to be more agile in recognizing that new diseases do occur, and once they've cropped up, they very well may come again, maybe not the same but very similar,"" said LeDuc, who formerly directed influenza response efforts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""So it was a shame that we had to stop that work and now are having to try and restart it."" For weeks, Hotez has been reaching out to pharmaceutical companies and federal scientific agencies â€” and even the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom â€” asking them to provide the roughly $3 million needed to begin testing the vaccine's safety in humans, but so far none have done so. ""We've had some conversations with big pharma companies in recent weeks about our vaccine, and literally one said, 'Well, we're holding back to see if this thing comes back year after year,'"" Hotez said. He said he hopes the seriousness of the outbreak leads to reforms in how the federal government funds vaccine development, although he notes that he called for similar changes after the SARS and Ebola outbreaks. He said he's particularly worried about the toll the coronavirus will take on elderly nursing home residents and health care workers. But when he talks to Congress on Thursday, Hotez said, he's also going to make an economic argument. ""Because nobody would invest a few million dollars into these SARS vaccines, we're looking at, I don't know what the number is, $10 billion, $100 billion in economic losses,"" Hotez said. ""The stakes are so high, and the amount of money you're talking about to fund this research is so modest.""",0,
442,"Kim Foxx, Chicago prosecutor, wins primary despite criticism over Smollett case  - CNN","Ray Sanchez, CNN","(CNN) Kim Foxx, the Chicago prosecutor criticized for her handling of actor Jussie Smollett's case, has virtually assured herself a second term with a victory in the Democratic primary. Her closest rival, Bill Conway, a former assistant state's attorney whose campaign was bankrolled by his billionaire father, conceded late Tuesday. Kim Foxx speaks with reporters in February. After a primary held amid the coronavirus outbreak, Foxx stood with her husband and teenage daughters before supporters Tuesday night. She thanked ""everyone who rallied and made it bigger than one thing, one issue, who rejected the notion that we would talk about one singular case and not what matted to the people of Cook County,"" CNN affiliate WTTW-TV reported. Foxx, 47, will face Republican Pat O'Brien, a former prosecutor and judge, in the mostly Democratic county in November. She took the helm of the nation's second-largest prosecutor's office four years ago by ousting a Democratic incumbent heavily criticized for her handling of the killing by Chicago police of a black teenager who was shot 16 times. Read More JUST WATCHED Get caught up on the Jussie Smollett saga Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Get caught up on the Jussie Smollett saga 03:23 Foxx's questionable handling of another high-profile case -- the racist and homophobic attack allegedly staged by Smollett, the former ""Empire"" actor -- had become the focus of the primary campaign. The primary was viewed as a test of the durability of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected across the country with vows to reform the criminal justice system. Foxx's rivals and other critics, including the police union, had tried to overshadow a record of reform praised by some experts, including the expunging of marijuana convictions, targeting gun violence and moving away from prosecuting nonviolent offenses, such as shoplifting. Her other Democratic challengers were former federal prosecutor Donna More and former Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti. Foxx faced intense criticism after her office suddenly decided in March 2019 to drop all 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct against Smollett, leading to accusations of political favoritism on her part. Smollett forfeited $10,000 in bail money and did community service. The prosecutor, who recused herself from the case, was blasted for her contact with Smollett family friend Tina Tchen -- a former chief of staff for first lady Michelle Obama and a lawyer -- before the charges were dropped. Smollett, who is gay and black, said he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack near his Chicago apartment on January 29, 2019. Police investigated the case as a hate crime but later said the actor orchestrated the attack and paid two acquaintances to stage the incident for publicity. The actor has repeatedly denied making up or orchestrating the assault. Still, a Cook County grand jury in February returned a six-count indictment against Smollett for making false reports to police that he was a victim of a hate crime, according to Dan K. Webb, a special prosecutor who investigated how local prosecutors handled the case. Webb said his office had ""sufficient factual evidence to determine that it disagrees"" with Foxx's handling of the case. Webb in a statement said Foxx was unable to provide ""documentary evidence"" showing ""other dispositions of similar cases prior to the Smollett case that would justify this disposition."" Foxx has admitted fault in her office's handling of the case and said it could have been more transparent. But she dismissed Webb's decision to indict Smollett weeks before the primary election as political. ""For the average citizens who live in communities impacted by violence ... Smollett is not an issue for them,"" she told CNN two weeks before the election. ""I'll have to answer for it. I'm accountable to it, but I'm also accountable that our system is fair and just to everyone."" In his concession speech Tuesday night, Conway said, ""At the end of the day, as Democrats, we both care deeply about our justice system, and I hope Ms. Foxx is able to enact so many of the reforms that it desperately needs,"" WBBM reported. Foxx, who grew up in Chicago's Cabrini Green housing project s , in 2016 defeated incumbent Anita Alvarez , whose tenure as top prosecutor was upended by the police shooting death of Laquan McDonald two years earlier. Police were accused of trying to cover up the death of the black teenager. She became the first black woman to head the prosecutor's office, drawing praise from criminal justice experts for exonerating the wrongfully convicted, increasing the standard for felony shoplifting from a minimum of $300 to $1,000 in stolen goods, and creating a gun crimes unit that put prosecutors to work in police districts with highest rates of violence.",0,
322,Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso relationship analysed as F1 duo hailed 'strongest ever' | F1 | Sport | Express.co.uk,James Benson," Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso always shared a great deal of respect even though they played mind games with each other. That's the verdict of former F1 driver Pedro de la Rosa, who was team-mates with the duo during their year together at McLaren in 2007. Hamilton burst onto the F1 scene 13 years ago as a fresh-faced hopeful tipped for superstardom at motorsport's highest level. He joined Alonso in a new-look McLaren line-up, with the Spaniard coming off the back of two successive World Drivers' Championship title wins at Renault. The dream team would only last 12 months, however, as tension grew between the duo and they were both left empty-handed, finishing second and third in the drivers' standings behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. De la Rosa, who was McLaren test driver in 2007, has now lifted the lid on the relationship Hamilton and Alonso shared at McLaren. READ MORE: Could Fernando Alonso return to battle Lewis Hamilton in F1?  And he's hailed the pairing as potentially being the best in F1 history, surpassing that of Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna at McLaren in the 1980s. ""I was surprised how it all exploded,"" De la Rosa told F1's Beyond the Grid podcast. ""If we look back, that driver pairing is possibly the strongest thereâ€™s ever been. Ever. I always think the new generations are stronger. So itâ€™s nothing against Senna/Prost, theyâ€™re my heroes, forever heroes, but that level â€“ Fernando/Lewis â€“ was amazing. ""I remember looking at their data and thinking: â€˜these guys are from a different planetâ€™. And still, I was not expecting for the relationship to explode. It was a shame because those guys would have brought so many championships to McLaren.

Resuming these surgeries on an outpatient basis is part of the administration's phase one plan to reopen the country and get Americans back to work. But before phase one can start, a state or region would have to have a downward trajectory of documented and potential coronavirus cases for two weeks and hospitals would have to have a robust testing program in place. The postponement of elective surgeries has delayed many patients' ability to get needed care and has wreaked havoc on hospital finances, forcing some to furlough employees and cut pay and hours -- even for emergency room doctors in areas without many cases. Congress set aside $100 billion for hospitals and health care providers to make up for lost revenue and cover additional expenses to combat the outbreak as part of its $2 trillion relief package . Lawmakers are looking at funneling billions more to the sector in their next bill. Restarting elective procedures will be determined on a state and local basis, and hospitals must meet certain criteria, said Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Read More Facilities must evaluate and prioritize what care should be given, screen staff and patients for symptoms, including temperature checks, and have sufficient personal protective equipment and other supplies on hand. Social distancing and sanitizing protocols should be in place. Also, when adequate testing capability is established, patients should be tested before care and staff should be regularly screened by lab tests. And conditions should be continuously evaluated since these procedures may have to halt if a surge in coronavirus cases takes place. The recommendations are generally in line with a road map released last week by four medical industry groups, including the American Hospital Association. It also stressed the importance of having a sustained reduction in cases, an adequate supply of staff, supplies and beds, availability of testing and the prioritization of cases, including cancer and transplants. The governors of several states, including Texas, Alaska, Oklahoma and West Virginia, have recently announced the loosening of restrictions on elective surgeries as part of the effort to reopen their states.",0,

As of Friday afternoon, there were over 260,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, but there may be a type of drug to fix it. Word on the street is that chloroquine phosphate may be the answer. “We have millions of units ordered, and we’re going to see what happens,"" said President Donald Trump. It’s a strong drug that been prescribed for many years. It’s known to treat malaria and severe arthritis. Chloroquine is also used in aquariums to kill some organisms like algae that may harm fish and other aquatic animals. Prices for chloroquine phosphate have gone through the roof online. The price that was once $9.99 is now up to $500 dollars on eBay. ""We’re going to be talking to the governors about it and the FDA is working on it right now,"" said President Trump. President Donald Trump stated that it would be a game-changer, but not a promise. “It’s early, but I’ve seen things that are impressive, and we’ll see, we’re going to know soon,"" said President Trump.",1,
252,COVID-19 VACCINES PART OF LONG HISTORY OF MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION ON CHILDREN,Children's Health Defense,"May 22 was a banner day for the encroaching global vaccine police state, with three announcements from the UK signaling what we can surely also expect on this side of the Atlantic. First, the entities rushing to develop an experimental chimpanzee-derived COVID-19 injection—the conflict-of-interest-ridden Oxford Vaccine Group, Oxford’s Jenner Institute and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca—announced the imminent expansion of their clinical trials to a wider age range, including children aged 5 to 12 years, despite  “troubling results” when they administered the vaccine to rhesus monkeys. Endorsing the scale-up of the experiment to more than 30,000 eventual participants, including a trial to evaluate the vaccine in young children, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) immediately awarded a generous “$1.2 billion cash injection” for the UK effort (provided without any input from economically strapped American taxpayers). COVID-19 Vaccines Part of Long History of Medical Experimentation on Children. May 22 was a banner day for the encroaching global vaccine police state, with three announcements from the UK signaling what we can surely also expect on this side of the Atlantic. First, the entities rushing to develop an experimental chimpanzee-derived COVID-19 injection—the conflict-of-interest-ridden Oxford Vaccine Group, Oxford’s Jenner Institute and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca—announced the imminent expansion of their clinical trials to a wider age range, including children aged 5 to 12 years, despite  “troubling results” when they administered the vaccine to rhesus monkeys. Endorsing the scale-up of the experiment to more than 30,000 eventual participants, including a trial to evaluate the vaccine in young children, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) immediately awarded a generous “$1.2 billion cash injection” for the UK effort (provided without any input from economically strapped American taxpayers). Then, to cap the day off, a UK Court of Appeal ominously ruled that local authorities can vaccinate children in foster care against their parents’ wishes, deploying the argument that “it is in the best interests of children to be immunised unless there is a specific reason for them not to be.” Anyone who has been paying a modicum of attention knows where the vaccine cartel wants this to end up—with a mandated injection that will sneak high-risk gene-altering nanoparticles, Trojan-horse-style, into our children, and eventually, into all of us. However, the use of children as a wedge to implement mandates for adults—the age group most affected by COVID-19—would deny children the equal protection of law because the vaccine will not be primarily for their benefit. A first step on this slippery slope will be to persuade unwitting parents to offer up their children on the altar of COVID-19 vaccine experimentation. It is unclear how the researchers will go about convincing parents to take this step, particularly because the most recent evidence—a systematic review of 45 scientific papers and letters—confirms that children account for only 1% to 5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and experience a milder course of disease, a better prognosis than adults, and death “extremely” rarely. Subjecting children to the hazards of clinical trials for a risk this low is perverse. A TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION. The COVID-19 imbroglio is far from the first time that children—unable to provide their own informed consent—have been roped into medical experiments. In 2003, Vera Sharav of the Alliance for Human Research Protection (AHRP) described how the use of children and adolescents in “ever more speculative experiments” has frequently put youth “at risk of harm for profit,” particularly following passage in 1997 of the ironically named Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (part of the FDA Modernization Act). According to Sharav, the Act launched a “backdoor” and an industry-friendly reshaping of the very notions of “potential benefit” and “minimal risk,” effectively depriving children of more protective federal regulations and opening up widespread opportunities for children’s exploitation; some at the FDA even suggested “that for research purposes, death may be classified as a ‘minimal risk.’” When Sharav served on the Children’s Workgroup of the National Human Research Protection Advisory Committee, she was the sole committee member to object to the increased use of children in high-risk medical experiments. Sharav’s website includes many examples illustrating the sordid underbelly of global and domestic childhood vaccine programs. In fact, it is hard not to construe the entire zero-liability childhood vaccination program as a mass experiment—one that willingly exposes children to risk in exchange for profit. U.S. children receive dozens of doses of vaccines that have never been evaluated in combination, nor tested against an inert placebo, nor meaningfully assessed for individual or synergistic toxicity, nor compared against protective health measures used by unvaccinated children. Unfortunately, lack of awareness and the widespread failure to report vaccine adverse events have allowed the damage caused by this ongoing experiment to remain invisible to many. On the other hand, some vaccines have produced such disastrous outcomes that the devastation has been impossible to ignore. Will American parents finally draw a line in the sand with COVID-19 vaccines? Currently, about half of U.S. adults are leery of COVID-19 vaccination, with 70% of potential refusers saying that they are concerned about safety. Could this be because over half of all American children now live with at least one chronic illness, and their beleaguered families have learned the hard way that vaccines are a major contributor? Some American parents may also know enough to read between the lines of recent upbeat press releases about COVID-19 vaccines. In the case of the experimental Oxford vaccine that researchers now want to rush into young children’s bodies, AstraZeneca’s CEO has chosen not to dwell on the fact that the vaccine resulted in across-the-board illness in monkeys. Instead, unable to restrain his excitement about the infusion of over a billion in HHS cash, he describes the accelerated vaccine development process as “a fantastic experience” and proclaims, “I’ve never seen anything move that fast.” Meanwhile, vigilant parents may also have noticed that the headline-grabbing Moderna vaccine just produced severe illness in four out of 45 participants (9%). One of these, a 29-year-old, described feeling “more sick than he ever has before”; fainting after an urgent care visit, “his girlfriend caught him and kept his head from hitting the floor.” Vera Sharav noted back in 2003 that the pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins and “greater government protections, subsidies, and tax incentives than any other industry,” and these remarks ring all the more true in the COVID-19 era. For example, early on when only 11 Americans had been confirmed to have the illness—February 4th—HHS was already hastening to assure would-be vaccine manufacturers that they would have full protection from liability. Is it any wonder that by early April, 115 COVID-19 vaccines had entered the pipeline or that the U.S. government had given the pharmaceutical industry the green light to “profit handsomely” from the government’s lavish public investments? The caveat in the preceding quote—“as long as the risk is low”—is unlikely to figure prominently in PR efforts designed to persuade parents to sign their children over to COVID-19 vaccine trials and mandates. Regarding the former, parents would do well to heed Sharav’s conclusions about experiments involving children: The primary beneficiaries are not the children but rather the pharmaceutical industry and its “partners in academia.” Although vaccine scientists like to take advantage of parents’ altruism by telling them that their children’s participation in vaccine trials is “necessary” and “important for public health,” Sharav’s research clearly indicates that “Children, even more than adults, have endured severe adverse effects in clinical trials.”",1,

The reigning UFC lightweight champion was supposed to return to action on Saturday night in the main event of UFC 249, in which he was scheduled to defend his lightweight title against Tony Ferguson. The coronavirus outbreak, however, laid waste to those plans and saw the most-anticipated fight in the history of the lightweight division fall through for a fifth time. Prior to the official cancellation of UFC 249 last Thursday, Nurmagomedov was forced to withdraw from the card as Russia introduced a blanket travel ban to curb the spread of COVID-19 - which left him trapped in his native Dagestan just days after he was denied entry to the United Arab Emirates. Attention has now turned to when the undefeated Russian - who was last in action last September - will return to the Octagon. Nurmagomedov, a devout Muslim, will begin Ramadan next week and will more than likely need at least a month to return to his pre-fasting state. JUST IN: Khabib Nurmagomedov manager takes aim at Conor McGregor on Twitter  I think he can be back in August Ali Abdelaziz on when Khabib Nurmagomedov will likely return And Abdelaziz believes 'The Eagle' will be ready to compete on the UFC's pay-per-view event in San Francisco in August. â€œI think because Ramadan is about to start next week,"" the Dominance MMA chief told MMA Junkie. ""I think he can be back in August. ""He told me that the UFC has scheduled San Franciso fight, I think it was August 1st. He can fight there. Thereâ€™s no problem.

61,Economic Collapse Far More Serious Than COVID-19 Contagion,Stephen Lendman,"The ongoing economic collapse combined with a public health crisis is unprecedented in modern memory.

The human toll from both mounts daily worldwide — a second 9/11 in new form that’s likely to be far more devastating for ordinary people in the West and elsewhere than in 2001 or during the Great Depression.

During the 1930s in America, an alphabet soup of constructive federal programs aided ordinary people in need, notably by jobs creation — positive actions, though not enough to end hard times for lack of greater spending needed that began in the run-up to and during WW II.

The 9/11 state-sponsored event launched endless wars on humanity at home and abroad.

The US attacked one country after another threatening no one, invented enemies, not real ones.

Police state laws were enacted, human and civil rights suffering a major body blow.

The standard of living in the US and West fell from the ravages of neoliberal harshness.

What Obama called “shared sacrifice” was all about ordinary people sacrificing so privileged ones could share at their expense — the earlier new normal entering its likely more devastating phase now.

COVID-19 combined with economic collapse continue war on humanity where 9/11 left off.

Wall Street banks and other politically well-connected companies were handed trillions of dollars in free money.

Ordinary people are getting short-term peanuts, for many not enough to survive without food aid, medical help, and suspension of rent or mortgage payment obligations.

The public health crisis will pass in time, the human economic toll for countless millions in the US and West to continue longterm.

It’ll likely include greater widespread poverty, unemployment, underemployment, human deprivation, and totalitarian rule, the latter enforced by police state harshness — an unacceptable new normal arriving in stages.

Economic collapse with longterm adverse consequences for the majority in the West is most worrisome. More on this below.

While the highly contagious novel coronavirus is influenza in new form, much about it remains to be learned, including effective treatments that aren’t available so far.

Rushing vaccine development and promoting mass vaccination will do far more harm than good.

All vaccines have toxic ingredients that are harmful to human health. No successful coronavirus vaccine was ever developed.

Whatever emerges ahead for COVID-19 will most likely be ineffective because it’s “unlike any other virus known to mankind and it exhibits a wide range of anomalous characteristics compared to other viruses,” Thailand Medical News (TMN) reported, adding:

Vaccines won’t work because “(i)t  will not be one drug that can treat the COVID-19 disease but a combination of many.”

Unlike other viruses, “every (novel coronavirus) change on its genome as it passes from host to host” results in numerous mutations, treatment needing to address their individual characteristics.  Infected asymptomatic individuals and others who recovered from infection (developing positive antibodies) remain vulnerable to re-infection.

There’s risk of other diseases resulting from infection, including what one genomic expert calls “strange chronic conditions (and) accelerated cancers.”

According to TMN, COVID-19’s “ability to mutate has been vastly underestimated,” new mutations discovered not previously seen, some more serious than others.

Epidemiologist/hepatologist Dr Li Lanjuan discovered new mutations in patients infected with the virus.

Treatment for one may be inappropriate for others. Dr. Li and her research team discovered over 30 COVID-19 mutations.

Are there many more still unknown? She warned that “the true diversity of the viral strains is still largely under-appreciated.”

Much more research is needed for greater knowledge of the virus in its various forms before effective treatments can be developed.

Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics Professor Xuegong Zhang explained that “(o)ur understanding of the virus remains quite shallow. There are so many uAnonymousswered questions.”

The good news is that the vast majority of infected individuals will recover.

The bad news is that the virus in its numerous mutating strains will likely be around for a long time.

The worst news is that loss of fundamental rights and economic collapse will likely cause far greater harm to countless millions of people in the US, West and elsewhere than the human toll from coronavirus strains.

Economic collapse is happening at breathtaking speed. US unemployment is far higher than reported numbers — 26 million more Americans out of work in the last month alone, millions more awaiting their unemployment applications to be processed.

Perhaps nearly half of working-age Americans are unemployed. According to Shadowstats economist John Williams, true US unemployment in April will likely be “more than double anything seen post-WW II,” the worst by far since the Great Depression.

The US economy is cratering. March retail sales fell over 10%. Industrial production is lowest since WW II ended.

Depending on how long economic crisis conditions last, things could exceed the worst of the Great Depression.

US Q II GDP “will see the deepest drop in modern history,” said Williams. Year-over-year new claims for unemployment insurance increased by “1859%.”

The surge in new filings continues. Williams estimates true US unemployment for April at “around 38%” of the workforce and heading higher.

Prior to the last month, the highest number of US weekly unemployment filings was 695,800 in 1982.

In the past four weeks, it would way exceed the 26 million number reported if all claims were processed as received.

Current hard times for most Americans are far more severe than the 2008-09 Great Recession.

Along with millions of new unemployment filings, there’s a record number of continuing claims — both numbers likely to keep rising until economic recovery begins.

Economic activity in Europe is affected like the US because of lockdowns.

The longer they continue, the greater the economic damage to most people and countless numbers of small and medium-sized business that may be unable to survive.

Is that planned in the US and perhaps Europe?

Will domiAnonymoust companies use economic crisis conditions to consolidate to greater size and market power by buying vulnerable businesses at fire sale prices while letting others fade away and die, reducing competition overall?

Will the legacy of what’s ongoing be greater power in the hands of domiAnonymoust enterprises, institutions, and ruling hardliners at the expense of public health, social justice, fundamental freedoms, and nations in the West more unsafe and unfit to live in than ever before what’s going on began?

Is what’s happening long ago planned by dark forces for aims they seek to achieve, or are events unfolding naturally?

The fullness of time will tell what I suspect is more the former than the latter, ordinary people harmed so privileged ones can benefit.

9/11 was made-in-the-US state-sponsored terrorism, planned well in advance.

The same is perhaps true about a second 9/11 in new form that’s ravaging economies, public health and welfare of ordinary people worldwide.

A more dismal new normal likely awaits in the US and West, exacerbating the disturbing trend since the neoliberal 90s.",1,
355,"Coronavirus: United selling, leasing back planes in bid to conserve cash",Phil LeBeau@Lebeaucarnews,"United Airlines has struck a deal with an Asian aircraft leasing firm to sell and then lease back 22 aircraft. Neither United nor the Bank of China Aviation revealed the financial terms of the deal announced Sunday morning. The move will help United conserve cash and give its balance sheet greater flexibility as it faces mounting losses due to coronavirus causing a global plunge in airline travel. Earlier this week, United CEO Oscar Munoz said business has essentially dropped to zero. ""We expect to fly fewer people during the entire month of May than we did on a single day in May 2019,"" Munoz wrote in a note to employees outlining plans to cut its schedule by 90% in May. The letter and warning came one day after the airline agreed to a $4.9 billion payroll grant from the U.S. Treasury. Sixteen of the planes involved in the deal are 737-9 Max models that have not yet been delivered by Boeing. United currently has approximately 800 planes in its fleet. Sale-leaseback agreements offer airlines greater financial flexibility while ensuring they will have the planes needed to fit their schedule.  For aircraft leasing companies, sale-leaseback agreements typically allow them to expand their portfolios while buying planes at a discount. Cirium, an aviation consulting firm, says airlines have parked more than two-thirds of the commercial airplanes in the world.  Given the extremely weak outlook for domestic and international travel, many analysts have predicted the industry is entering a period where carriers will defer or cancel orders. Another possibility is for airlines to sell their planes to other airlines or aircraft leasing firms.",0,
523,"In 1911, another epidemic swept through China. That time, the world came together - CNN","Paul French, for CNN","(CNN) In 1911, a deadly epidemic spread through China and threatened to become a pandemic. Its origins appeared to be related to the trade in wild animals, but at the time no one was sure. Lockdowns, quarantine measures, the wearing of masks, travel restrictions, the mass cremation of victims, and border controls were deployed to try to lower the infection rate. Yet more than 60,000 people died in modern-day northeast China, making it one of the world's largest epidemics at the time. When the disease was eventually brought under control, the Chinese government convened the International Plague Conference in the northern city of Shenyang -- close to the epicenter of the outbreak. In attendance were virologists, bacteriologists, epidemiologists and disease experts from many of the world's major powers -- the United States, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and France. Illustration of the Reaper (allegory of Death) above Manchuria, which was published in Le Petit Journal, in  France, in 1911. The purpose of the conference was to find the cause of the outbreak, learn which suppression techniques were most effective, discover why the disease had spread so far so fast, and assess what could be done to prevent a second wave. While the conference was not without some finger pointing, it was mostly a genuine attempt to learn. Read More As the world now faces a pandemic characterized by a lack of a globally co-ordinated response and multilateral effort on the part of political leaders, the collaborative aspects of the 1911 conference in north-eastern China are worth reconsidering. Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) appears compromised, the virus has been racialized, major nations are angry with each other and competing for resources and control of the narrative, while poorer countries are left to fend largely for themselves. Compared to 1911, we appear a polarized and divided world. Marmots and plague The Great Manchurian Plague that broke out across northeastern China in 1910 was devastating. From the autumn of 1910, until the outbreak was finally suppressed the following year, an estimated 63,000 people died. The epidemic hit international headlines when it reached the northeastern city of Harbin, in today's Heilongjiang province, then part of what was known as Manchuria, a vast, agriculturally important, but relatively sparsely populated, region situated the juncture of the Chinese, Japanese and Russian spheres of influence. The majority of the territory was Chinese-governed, with Japan controlling the port area around Dalian and Russia running Manchuria's railways. Harbin was an international city, home to many Russians who worked for the China Eastern Railway (CER), which connected the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Japanese-controled port city of Dalian. The city was also home to large communities of Japanese, Americans and Europeans engaged in trades connected to the railway. That included the fur trade, and it was from this industry that the disease most likely came. Tarbagan marmot (Marmota sibirica), a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae, in steppes around Khukh Lake, Mongolia. The Tarbagan marmot was a species of rodent that lived mostly on the grasslands and steppe of Mongolia and neighboring Manchuria. European, American and Japanese furriers had long purchased sable, mink and otter furs from local hunters, but had never been interested in the coarse fur of the Tarbagan marmot. But new dying techniques at the start of the century allowed marmot fur to pass as an affordable alternative for better-quality furs. Thousands of nomadic local hunters were tasked by foreign buyers with bringing marmot hides, which soared in value in the years before the virus. Rural hunters had long avoided using diseased marmots for food, but did not think to cast aside the hides of sick animals -- especially not when they were worth so much. Pinpointing the initial outbreak of the plague is hard, but it was first officially noted by Russian doctors in Manzhouli, an Inner Mongolian town on the Chinese-Russian border, which had grown up around the CER. The symptoms were alarming -- fever followed by haemoptysis (the coughing up of blood). In Manzhouli, the dead were left in the street and railway freight cars were turned into quarantine wards. A picture of victims of the Great Manchurian Plague. Just as viruses spread fast along airline routes today, back then the railways facilitated the spread. Fear in Manzhouli meant many people followed the routes the marmot hides had taken along the CER to the Heilongjiang city of Qiqihar, and then on to Harbin. Cases of the pneumonic plague appeared in major rail termini -- Tianjin, Beijing and along the Beijing to Wuhan railway. Even Shanghai, almost 2,000 miles from Manzhouli, reported a case and considered a lockdown of the city to prevent wider infection. In the crowded slums of Harbin, the disease took hold swiftly. By November 8, 1910, Harbin had a death toll of 5,272. Initial response and debates The response to the outbreak was rapid, given the logistical constraints at the start of the 20th century. Quarantine centers were established, mostly in converted rail freight cars, for people the authorities thought had have come into contact with the disease -- relatives of the dead plus those in the fur trapping and trading business. If the quarantined didn't showed symptoms within five-to-10 days they were released with a wire wristband fastened with a lead seal stating they were plague free. But if symptoms did show, the entire freight car was essentially doomed, given the disease's staggering near 100% mortality rate. Burials were forbidden; mass cremations were enforced. In Harbin, the Chinese authorities' lead doctor Wu Lien-teh, a Malaysia-born ethnic-Chinese medic educated at Cambridge University, was managing to contain the outbreak. This photo taken sometime between 1910 and 1915 shows Dr. Wu Lien-teh, a Cambridge-educated Chinese physician who pioneered the use of masks during the Manchurian Plague of 1910-11. Wu began post-mortem exams of victims and crucially established that the disease was pneumonic plague and not bubonic (the difference between the forms of plague is the location of infection; in pneumonic plague the infection is in the lungs, in bubonic plague, the lymph nodes). He also heavily recommended the wearing of face masks. By early 1911, China had mobilized doctors and epidemiologists from across China to converge on Harbin. Wu knew there was a big deadline looming. Chinese New Year was officially January 30 and Wu knew that limiting travel would be almost impossible during the annual migration home for so many Chinese people. If the infection rate wasn't brought down, then it risked becoming a nationwide epidemic. The response was sometimes harsh -- any lodging house where an infection appeared was burnt to the ground. But overall Wu's anti-plague measures worked. So-called ""sanitary zones,"" quarantines, lockdowns, isolation, travel restrictions and face masks were all implemented and appear to have brought the infection rate in Harbin down by the end of January. Infections had spread, however, along the rail line. By the start of January 1911, Shenyang had over 2,571 deaths. Eventually, quarantining and travel restrictions in Shenyang began to take effect and the infection rate fell. But the rail line extended onwards and several towns close to the major port city of Dalian reported cases. In Dalian itself, mass inspections of train and ship passengers were instituted, the line was then shut, and ferries from Dalian ordered to remain in port. This meant the plague never reached Dalian. Though cases continued to pop up across Manchuria and occasionally beyond, in Harbin, Wu declared the plague suppressed at the end of January 1911, with a final mass cremation of victims. It was time to convene an international conference to try to find out why the outbreak had been so severe and widespread -- and which anti-plague measures had worked best. A conference in Shenyang Yale professor William C Summers notes in his 2012 study of the Great Manchurian Plague that: ""By the end of January 1911, the momentum for some sort of international consortium of 'experts' to come together in China was building rapidly."" The conference was not without risk for the Chinese. China had a Russian-controlled rail line running through a vast swathe of its territory, Japan was ensconced in Dalian and controlling China's major northern seaport, and the European powers and US had treaty ports up and down the country. Kitajskaya street in Harbin circa 1932. Still, they pushed ahead with hosting, which helped China avoid the charge of doing nothing in the aftermath of the epidemic. All attendees pledged that the conference was primarily concerned with scientific investigation, and not with imposing any further controls on China from outside. By April 3, 1911, Shenyang's Shao Ho Yien palace had been turned into a conference center that included meeting rooms, laboratories for experiments and living quarters for the delegates. As well as the principal countries mentioned, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria-Hungary all sent experts. Many were from prestigious institutes. The main body of the conference sought to deal with eliminating the bad science and gossip, and getting to the scientific root of the bacteria. It was high-level science for the day -- bacterial toxins, surface agglutinins, variant strains. There was also discussion of modes of contagion such as coughing and false theories such as the passing of the bacillus on food. There even was talk of what we would now call asymptomatic patients and super-spreaders. Containment was a major theme. What had worked best? Emergency quarantine and travel measures, certainly. Also, the early use of face masks which predated Wu's discovery of the bacillus as pneumonic. Additionally, the rapid construction of plague hospitals to isolate the infected and potentially infected from ordinary hospital patients. Harbin Railway Station, taken in about 1900. The conference wrapped on April 28, 1911, with closing remarks by Wu. Ultimately, China's fears that Russia, Japan or the European powers would use the conference to advance their political aims against China didn't materialize. The conference's conclusions and resolutions dealt with the science of the plague, the need for sanitary improvements, quarantine regulations and the unwitting cause of the epidemic, the Tarbagan marmot. Closing the conference Dr Wu urged that: ""Every effort should be made to secure effective medical education in China."" Global responses In 1911 there was no WHO. The response to the epidemic, the job of trying to limit its spread and suppress it, was left to individual nations, often nations with political antagonisms. There were no politicians in Shenyang, only scientists who saw the need for a global intergovernmental response -- and a global health organization. That did begin to emerge after the First World War with the League of Nations formed in the wake of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The League took on matters relating to health through its Health Bureau, formed by an executive section of medical experts. The bureau targeted the eradication of leprosy, malaria and yellow fever and successfully helped to contain epidemics of typhus in Russia and various outbreaks of cholera and typhoid in China between the wars. After World War II, the League's successor, the United Nations, created the WHO. A history of the plague in China, from ancient times to Mao -- and now The Great Manchurian Plague did not ultimately spread in any serious way to the rest of China, Mongolia or Russia. The shutdown of Dalian port stopped the spread out from Manchuria to major destinations in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia. From there it could have moved by ocean liner to Europe, America and throughout the world. But it didn't. Summers, the historian, said that containment was down to a joined up response. ""Such a conjunction of the right knowledge, the right resources, and the right people has not always been the case in other global challenges of epidemic disease,"" he said. Measures taken today around the world -- specially constructed quarantine hospitals, mask wearing ordinances, enhanced sanitary practices, travel restrictions, grounded planes and dedicated teams of healthcare workers -- in many ways replicate those taken 110 years ago in northeastern China. However, the major players today -- the US, China, the nations of the European Union, and Japan -- seemingly have little interest in a coordinated response to the health crisis and prospects of any apolitical conference seem remote. In 1911, the world's leading disease experts were eager to get to China. Perhaps that is what needs to happen at some point after the coronavirus pandemic: the world's scientists could circumvent the politicians to find a way to meet, share and discuss Covid-19 in an open forum.",0,
260,Scientists Believe Signs of ‘Human Intervention’ are in Coronavirus Strain Cultured to Attack Human Cells, Big League Politics,"An Austrian study conducted by vaccine researcher Nikolai Petrovsky has indicated that SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus strain that causes COVID-19, contains a “sign of human intervention.”

Petrovsky, who does research for Flinders University in Austria, has come to the conclusion that the virus was optimized to penetrate human cells rather than animal cells. Barring some “remarkable coincidence,” Petrovsky believes this means the virus was engineered to attack humans.

Lifesite News, who broke the story, reported that the scientists “used a version of the novel coronavirus collected in the earliest days of the outbreak and applied computer models to test its capacity to bind to certain cell receptor enzymes, called “ACE2,” that allow the virus to infect human and animal cells to varying degrees of efficacy.”

Scientists discovered that “the novel coronavirus most powerfully binds with human ACE2, and with variously lesser degrees of effectiveness with animal versions of the receptor.” They believe this means SARS-CoV-2 “became specialized for human cell penetration by living previously in human cells, quite possibly in a laboratory.”

The study explains its conclusions by stating that “a virus would be expected to have highest affinity for the receptor in its original host species, e.g. bat, with a lower initial binding affinity for the receptor of any new host, e.g. humans. However, in this case, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher for humans than for the putative original host species, bats, or for any potential intermediary host species.”

The study notes a “possibility which still cannot be excluded is that SARSCoV-2 was created by a recombination event that occurred inadvertently or consciously in a laboratory handling coronaviruses, with the new virus then accidentally released into the local human population.”

Petrovsky believes the virus was cultured to evolve over time, meaning that this could have been many years in the making.",1,

216,USA Plan: Militarized Control of Population. The “National Covid-19 Testing Action Plan”,Manlio Dinucci,"The Plan – that some of the most prestigious universities have contributed to (Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins and others) – prefigures a real hierarchical and militarized social model.

At the top, the “Pandemic Testing Board (PTB), akin to the War Production Board that the United States created in World War II“. The Pandemic Testing Board would “consist of leaders from business, government and academia” (government representatives would not in the first row, but finance and economic representatives being listed in order of importance).

This Supreme Council would have the power to decide productions and services with an authority similar to that conferred to the President of the United States in wartime by the Defense Production Act.

The plan calls for 3 million US citizens to be Covid-19 tested weekly, and the number should be raised to 30 million per week within six months. The goal is to achieve the ability to Covid-19 test 30 million people a day, which is to be realized within a year.

No One Trusts the US Government, Not Even the American People
For each test, “a fair market reimbursement (e.g. $100) for all Covid-19 assays” is expected. Thus, billions of dollars a month of public money will be needed.

The Rockefeller Foundation and its financial partners will help create a network for the provision of credit guarantees and the signing of contracts with suppliers, that is large companies that manufacture drugs and medical equipment.

According to the Plan, the “Pandemic Control Council” is also authorized to create a “Pandemic Response Corps”: a special force (not surprisingly called “Corps” like the Marine Corps) with a staff of 100 to 300 thousand components.

They would be recruited among Peace Corps and Americorps volunteers (officially created by the US government to “help developing countries”) and among National Guard military personnel. The members of the “Pandemic Response Corps” would receive an average gross wage of $40,000 per year, a State expenditure of  $4-12 billion a year is expected for it.

The “pandemic response body” would above all have the task of controlling the population with military-like techniques, through digital tracking and identification systems, in work and study places, in residential areas, in public places and when travelling. Systems of this type – the Rockefeller Foundation recalls – are made by Apple, Google and Facebook.

According to the Plan, information on individuals relating to their state of health and their activities would remain confidential “whenever possible”. However, they would all be centralized in a digital platform co-managed by the Federal State and private companies. According to data provided by the “Pandemic Control Council”, it would be decided from time to time which area should be subject to lockdown and for how long.

This, in summary, is the plan the Rockefeller Foundation wants to implement in the United States and beyond. If it were even partially implemented, there would be further concentration of economic and political power in the hands of an even narrower elite sector to the detriment of a growing majority that would be deprived of fundamental democratic rights.

The operation is carried out in the name of “Covid-19 control”, whose mortality rate has so far been less than 0.03% of the US population according to official data. In the Rockefeller Foundation Plan the virus is used as a real weapon, more dangerous than Covid-19 itself.",1,
438,Coronavirus UK: NHS issues new advice - Which painkillers can you take for coronavirus? | Express.co.uk,Georgina Laud," Coronavirus guidance is changing daily as scientists work to understand the new virus, which was first discovered in China in December 2019. There are new measures in place for isolation, Britons are required to practice social distancing as the Government revealed some groups are at a higher risk than others. One confusion arose over the use of painkillers to treat coronavirus symptoms. Coronavirus causes a cough, fever and body aches, as well as potentially causing shortness of breath and pneumonia. As shoppers head to the supermarkets and chemists to get stocked up, there was conflicting advice over which medications to use. Now the NHS has issued fresh guidance to stop the confusion.

""In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctorâ€™s advice.â€  The NHS had initially said on it's coronavirus advice page sufferers could use both ibuprofen and paracetamol but has since amended their advice.

It adds: ""There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (COVID-19) worse.

Advice from the NHS on their coronavirus pages now reads: ""Drink plenty of water and take paracetamol to help with your symptoms"". Paracetamol is a pain reliever and can also reduce fever so can help with coronavirus symptoms. A frontline NHS doctor, who chose to remain anonymous, told PA they are concerned a lack of testing in the UK for coronavirus could mean patients in need of NSAIDs are denied pain relief unnecessarily. They said: â€œIf you're a rheumatoid patient and you have chronic pain you may need that to function. ""They're being told to stop because of the virus, but again they're not being tested so you don't know.

103,A top German doctor recommends whiskey to protect against COVID-19,Tessa Robinson,"While the World Health Organization vehemently disagrees, Dr. Juergen Rissland, a lead doctor at the Institute for Virology at Saarland University Hospital in Germany, went on the record to say: Drinking whiskey can protect against COVID-19.

And that is definitely one report we can all get behind.

While appearing on ""The Morning Show,"" Dr. Rissland was asked about whether or not drinking alcohol could kill any viruses a person may have ingested. ""Yes, of course, that's true,"" Dr. Rissland responded. ""And the higher the percentage of alcohol, the better it is. For example, if you are a whisky lover, then that certainly isn't a bad idea,"" he continued, while offering this bit of sage advice to pace yourself: ""But of course you need to bear in mind that you can't do that every 15 minutes, that is something else to consider."" After being prodded a little further by the show's co-hosts who asked him if he was really suggesting folks drink high-proof alcohol, Dr. Rissland didn't back down or attempt to clarify his remarks. Instead, he added, ""I would say it can't do any harm although we need to remember that it's not a guaranteed cure for the problem.""

So there you have it, at least from the Germans: Prost!

430,Coronavirus can persist in air for hours and on surfaces for days - study - Reuters,Gene Emery,"(Reuters) - The highly contagious novel coronavirus that has exploded into a global pandemic can remain viable and infectious in droplets in the air for hours and on surfaces up to days, according to a new study that should offer guidance to help people avoid contracting the respiratory illness called COVID-19. Scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, attempted to mimic the virus deposited from an infected person onto everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting, such as through coughing or touching objects. They used a device to dispense an aerosol that duplicated the microscopic droplets created in a cough or a sneeze. The scientists then investigated how long SARS-CoV-2 remained infectious on these surfaces, according to the study that appeared online in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday - a day in which U.S. COVID-19 cases surged past 5,200 and deaths approached 100. The tests show that when the virus is carried by the droplets released when someone coughs or sneezes, it remains viable, or able to still infect people, in aerosols for at least three hours. On plastic and stainless steel, viable virus could be detected after three days. On cardboard, the virus was not viable after 24 hours. On copper, it took 4 hours for the virus to become inactivated. In terms of half-life, the research team found that it takes about 66 minutes for half the virus particles to lose function if they are in an aerosol droplet. That means that after another hour and six minutes, three quarters of the virus particles will be essentially inactivated but 25% will still be viable. The amount of viable virus at the end of the third hour will be down to 12.5%, according to the research led by Neeltje van Doremalen of the NIAIDâ€™s Montana facility at Rocky Mountain Laboratories. On stainless steel, it takes 5 hours 38 minutes for half of the virus particles to become inactive. On plastic, the half-life is 6 hours 49 minutes, researchers found. On cardboard, the half-life was about three and a half hours, but the researchers said there was a lot of variability in those results â€œso we advise cautionâ€ interpreting that number. The shortest survival time was on copper, where half the virus became inactivated within 46 minutes. As part of their experiments, the researchers compared the stability of SARS-CoV-2 to that of SARS-CoV-1 under the same experimental circumstances and found similar results. â€œThis indicates that differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these viruses probably arise from other factors,â€ they conclude, â€œincluding high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic.",0,

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday . (CNN) There is a global expectation that life will inch back to normal if enough people develop immunity against the novel coronavirus. As scientists race to develop antibody tests , politicians have promised to reopen their economies once such testing is available. But last night the World Health Organization poured some cold water on these hopes. It warned that there is no evidence that the presence of antibodies in blood can determine whether someone has immunity. Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director for health emergencies at the WHO, questioned the idea that many people have already developed immunity. ""There's been an expectation, maybe, that herd immunity may have been achieved and that the majority of people in society may already have developed antibodies,"" he said. ""I think the general evidence is pointing against that .... so it may not solve the problem the governments are trying to solve."" There are plenty of worrying signs. In South Korea, 163 people who recovered from coronavirus have retested positive. China has experienced similar episodes, Paula Hancocks, Yoonjung Seo and Julia Hollingsworth report . Scientists hope there are other explanations for this phenomenon -- that perhaps tests are picking up remnants of the virus or generating false positives. And while they underline that no evidence exists that a person who has retested positive can spread the virus further, there haven't been any conclusive studies to rule it out.

463,Coronavirus stimulus bill: Pelosi says 'real optimism' Congress can reach deal soon,Jacob Pramuk@jacobpramuk,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sounded a hopeful tone Tuesday about Republicans and Democrats striking an agreement on a staggering stimulus package to blunt the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. ""I think there is real optimism that we could get something done in the next few hours,"" Pelosi told CNBC's Jim Cramer in a phone interview on ""Squawk on the Street"" as Senate Republicans and Democrats moved closer to a deal. The California Democrat later added that the bill is ""getting to a good place ... if they stay there."" Pelosi has criticized versions of the GOP's developing legislation, saying it goes too far to help corporations damaged by the outbreak without doing enough to aid workers ravaged by it. House Democrats released their own $2.5 trillion relief plan on Monday â€” though it is unlikely to go anywhere as long as the Senate makes progress. Major U.S. stock indexes climbed more than 5% on Tuesday as optimism about a deal rose. Democrats had taken particular issue with the potential conditions imposed on ailing corporations that receive aid from a pool of $500 billion in taxpayer money. Pelosi said Tuesday ""things like a $500 billion slush fund are really insulting."" But the speaker said she was encouraged by the Trump administration agreeing to add more oversight to how it doles out the funding pool, which she called a ""big change."" Pelosi noted that the proposal would include an inspector general and a congressional panel of five people to oversee the aid. ""We think the bill has move sufficiently to the side of workers,"" she said. Congress has faced enormous pressure to rescue the economy and health-care system as patients overwhelm hospitals, workers get laid off and businesses small and large suffer. If lawmakers can come to an agreement on a stimulus package, it would be the third proposal they have passed to respond to the pandemic raging across the U.S. More than 46,000 people have had COVID-19 in the U.S., while at least 593 people have died from it, according to Johns Hopkins University. President Donald Trump applied more pressure to Congress on Tuesday morning. In a tweet, he said ""Congress must approve the deal, without all the nonsense, today."" ""The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!"" he wrote amid reported frustrations about the economic havoc caused by businesses shutting down across the country.  On Monday, Trump suggested that he wants to urge businesses to reopen â€” sooner rather than later â€” while the government works to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Senate Democrats blocked Republican efforts to move legislation forward twice on Sunday and Monday, sparking a level of anger rarely seen on the Senate floor. House members are currently out of Washington at least until they have a stimulus agreement to consider. Safety has become a major concern for lawmakers after two representatives and a senator tested positive for COVID-19, forcing other members of Congress with whom they interacted to go into isolation. Pelosi told CNBC she hopes the parties come to a widely accepted agreement the House can pass by unanimous consent â€” meaning it could quickly approve legislation without returning to the Capitol. But any one representative could hold up the mammoth spending package under that process. Correction: The House proposal would cost $2.5 trillion.

72,COVID-19: Cover for Military Attack on Iran and Iraq?,Kurt Nimmo,"It was Rahm Emmanuel who said the state should never let a “good crisis go to waste.”

In regard to Iran, the neocons will not let the COVID-19 “crisis” go to waste. It is a perfect cover for escalating tension with the Islamic Republic. 

It is more than obvious the geopolitical ignoramus Donald Trump is under the influence of a gaggle of neocons chomping at the bit to kill tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Iranians. “Trump, who did not detail the plot, made the threat less than an hour after receiving a foreign intelligence briefing at the White House,” reported USA Today. “Later at a briefing, Trump said the intelligence indicating an attack was sound.” 

Iranian-backed militias in Iraq continually threaten to attack U.S. and allied forces, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Threats arrive in a daily stream.

Some of the more visible threats have been issued by the Kataib Hezbollah militia, the group responsible for rocket attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq that have killed American troops and contractors.

Iraqis have repeatedly and overwhelmingly demanded the US occupation forces leave the country, a demand rejected by Trump and his neocon foreign policy controllers. 

From FRN: 

Iraq’s parliament last month [January, 2020] voted to have the US troops removed from the country, heeding a call from former Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi to take urgent measures and end the presence of the foreign forces as soon as possible.

The Iraqi Parliament passed a resolution to work to end the foreign troop presence in the Arab country in the wake of a US targeted assassination of a top Iranian general and a commander of Iraqi popular forces.

“U.S. intelligence out of the Middle East suggests that Iran or Iran-backed forces are planning a potentially serious attack against U.S. military personnel in Iraq, said officials monitoring the information,” The War Street Journal reported on April Fools Day.

The late CIA whistleblower Victor Marchetti documented how the agency has specialized in lies and deception since its inception in the late 1940s.  As a special assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA,  Marchetti knew a thing or two about the role played by US intelligence, its pathological lies, and obsessive-compulsive secrecy.  

The real reason for the official secrecy, in most instances, is not to keep the opposition (the CIA’s euphemistic term for the enemy) from knowing what is going on; the enemy usually does know. The basic reason for governmental secrecy is to keep you, the American public, from knowing—for you, too, are considered the opposition, or enemy—so that you cannot interfere. When the public does not know what the government or the CIA is doing, it cannot voice its approval or disapproval of their actions. In fact, they can even lie to you about what they are doing or have done, and you will not know it.

Due to an avalanche of lies and distortions issued by the state and the corporate media’s dutiful stenographic repetition of war propaganda, omission of facts, distortions of reality, and endless demonization of official enemies, many Americans are unable to see what should be more than obvious—the rocket attacks on illegal US bases in Iraq following a lawful order by the Iraqi government demanding US troops leave the country are a completely justified and warranted response to a never-ending occupation. 

Ignored is the historical fact Shi’as in Iran and Iraq share religious and cultural ties and have done so for centuries, well before the region was carved up by Britain and France following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. 

Iran’s Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri told The Tehran Times the rocket attacks on US bases are a “normal reaction by the Iraqi people and resistance forces against U.S. ‘satanic measures’… Americans are well aware that the people of the region and the dear people of Iraq are opposed to their military presence in these countries and it is their normal reaction.” 

Now that the American people are consumed with fear and loathing of an overblown virus “pandemic,” the neocons around Trump see a chance to finally and decisively deal with Iran—not simply by blocking humanitarian aid but also piling on more sanctions and, possibly within a matter of days or weeks, attacking Shi’a militias in Iraq and possibly launching a long-promised direct military attack on Iran proper.

40,Churchgoers Must Register With the Government in Kansas City,Anonymous,"I am running out of adjectives to describe how completely insane the tyrannical abuses launched by state governors and local officials against pastors and churches are becoming. It is as if these leaders never bothered to so much as glance at the Constitution they swore to uphold and defend. They seem to be governing from some make-believe, dystopian viewpoint. Yesterday, we received a desperate call from a Kansas City, Missouri, church whose local government is reaching new and terrifying heights in destroying our constitutional freedom. The Kansas City government is now DEMANDING that churches record the names and contact information of anyone who attends church for 10 minutes or more so the Kansas Department of Health can “quickly trace, test, and isolate individuals” who may have been exposed to someone who may have COVID-19. This order does not apply to “essential” businesses, but does apply to all “non-essential” businesses.
The new order states that by recording names and contact information, the health department will be able “to more quickly trace, test, and isolate individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19.” Anyone who does not provide this information should be refused entrance!
The Germans did this very thing to Jews – collecting the names and locations of all known synagogue attendees - in the early days of the Nazi regime. Never in our wildest dreams could we have imagined Nazi-like measures designed to surveil, track and spy upon what was once a FREE American people. Yet that is exactly what Kansas City’s misguided government officials are now demanding.
Every day that passes during the COVID-19 panic seems to bring a new list of illegal and unconstitutional mandates issued by state and local politicians intent on ignoring their state laws, the U.S. Constitution, and the Department of Justice. Even the announcement that U.S. Attorney General William Barr will investigate and prosecute constitutional abuses has failed to stop the unbelievable overreach by these tyrannical officials.
We are at the brink of losing America as we know it, along with all the liberties our once-free people enjoyed. Our President, Donald Trump, is doing his level best to bring the country out of the over-hyped, media-driven COVID panic. But some congressional and state level officials (led by Democrats) seem to be doing everything they can to thwart not only a recovery, but also the very foundations of our republic!
These attacks on our churches cannot stand. The backbone of our country relies on our constitutionally guaranteed ability to worship and serve our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
We have already filed suit in several states against governors who have illegally and unconstitutionally fomented the arrests of pastors and launched attacks on the liberties of congregants. We will fight these cases all the way to the Supreme Court if we must. But we need YOUR help to defend freedom.",1,
398,U.S. revs up ventilator production for coronavirus patients as need wanes - Reuters,"David Shepardson, Carl O'Donnell","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration, under pressure to do more to ramp up coronavirus testing in order to safely reopen the battered U.S. economy, is highlighting this week a $2.9 billion program to build 187,000 ventilators this year. The administrationâ€™s ventilator surge is accelerating as medical experts are forecasting the need for the devices - used to help severely ill COVID-19 patients breathe - will fall. Many of the ventilators will now be sent to other countries in need, the administration says. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday plans to visit a General Electric Co (GE.N) facility in Madison, Wisconsin, where they assemble ventilators, the company and his office confirmed. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump taunted critics of his administrationâ€™s coronavirus response, tweeting: â€œLast month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, â€œVentilators, Ventilators, Ventilators.â€ They screamed it loud & clear, & thought they had us cold, even though it was the Stateâ€™s task. But everyone got their Vâ€™s, with many to spare.â€ Ventilators became a symbol in March of the lack of preparedness in the U.S. medical system for the surge in patients suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus that attacks the lungs. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state has been the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 240,000 cases, had said his state alone could need as many as 30,000 ventilators. On March 27, Trump invoked the Korean War era Defense Production Act to compel General Motors Co (GM.N) to build ventilators. â€œWe have so many now that at some point soon weâ€™re going to be helping Mexico and Italy and other countries,â€ Trump said on Monday. â€œWeâ€™ll be sending them ventilators, which they desperately need.â€ Now, governors and business leaders have shifted their focus away from ventilators to the lack of widespread coronavirus testing that medical experts say is necessary to safely end stay-at-home orders and allow people to go back to work. With the number of New York patients needing intensive care declining, Cuomo said last week he will send some of the ventilators his state received and no longer needs to Maryland and Michigan. The governmentâ€™s ventilator buying spree comes as the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE) currently forecasts total needs for invasive ventilators at 16,631 units, a fraction of the total the United States plans to buy. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has not broken out how many of the 187,000 ventilators are invasive versions. Whether U.S. hospitals will need all the ventilators companies such as GM, Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Electric and Philips (PHG.AS) are now contracted to build will depend on whether the pandemic eases, or gets worse, experts said. Dr. Christopher Murray, the director of IMHE at the University of Washington, told Reuters demand for ventilators could rise sharply â€œif there is a second wave of infection or an immediate rebound when we take off social distancing.â€ Some states have said they will begin reopening parts of their economies earlier than health experts are recommending. If the United States maintains social distancing then the planned production of nearly 190,000 ventilators would be â€œway beyond what we will need,â€ Murray said. Either way, ventilator companies are ramping up production to levels way beyond pre-pandemic demand. Records made public of some HHS ventilator contracts show they were single-source contracts with no competitive bids, which the agency said was due to the urgent need. Zoll, a unit of Asahi Kasei Group (3407.T) and one of the companies that received an HHS contract, is boosting production by 25 times to 10,000 per month. Resmed Inc (RMD.N) received a $32 million HHS contract to produce 2,550 ventilators by July 13. â€œFEMA was very specific that they only want invasive ventilators,â€ Resmed Chief Executive Mick Farrell told Reuters, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency that is directing the ventilator program. â€œFEMA is building up these ventilators as a backstop,â€ added     Farrell, who called the agencyâ€™s production target reasonable. â€œIf you look at Germany, they had 50,000 ventilators for a population of about 80 million,â€ Farrell said, noting that would mean the United States could need 200,000 given its much larger population. â€œI think FEMA was looking at models from Germany and France and then maybe added a buffer on top of that to play it safe.â€ Trump on Saturday said the United States will send ventilators to Mexico after a discussion with his Mexican counterpart. â€œI told him weâ€™re going to be helping him very substantially,â€ Trump said. Hill-Rom (HRC.N), which also got an HHS contract and makes non-invasive ventilators, has increased its production by five times its pre-pandemic levels and predicted it could be months before the health crisis is over. â€œThe idea is not only to make sure we in the U.S. but also around the world have them God forbid something like this should ever happen again,â€ Hill-Rom spokesman Howard Karesh said.

515,Adam Henson wife: Who is Charlotte Henson? Do they have children? | Celebrity News | Showbiz & TV | Express.co.uk,Amalie Henden," Presenter Adam is back on our screens for another episode of Countryfile on BBC tonight. The farmer and TV presenter has been part of the successful programme since 2001 and his passion for farming and conservation has made him a fan-favourite among the millions of viewers Countryfile attracts every Sunday. Not much is known about Adamâ€™s long-time partner Charlotte Henson, but the couple never married. The pair have known each other since Adam was just 16 and they were both still in school. Adam and Charlotte live on his Cotswold rare breeds farm where they have rare cattle, sheep, pigs and horses. READ MORE: Matt Baker announces â€˜new lookâ€™ Countryfile on BBC   The 54-year-old TV presenter has previously said Charlotte does not eat meat and is a vegetarian. Speaking to The Mirror in May 2019, Adam said: â€œHeâ€™s very much all for living off the land and eats the meat bred on his farm when he can. â€œBut that doesnâ€™t mean he doesnâ€™t appreciate a plant-based diet. â€œI must start growing more veggies. My partner and daughter are vegetarians, but my son and I eat meat.â€  â€œFarmers working closely with the RSPCA is crucial. â€œWhat drives me mad are the vegan vigilantes who post horrendous things on social media that arenâ€™t true. There has to be a balance. â€œBut let people eat what they want. I donâ€™t have a problem with it.â€ Speaking about taking the job on Countryfile Adam said Charlotte â€œnaggedâ€ him to apply for the job when it was first advertised.

""After lots of auditions, I ended up getting the job. ""At first I was only working once a month, then when it went prime time, the viewing figures went up to six million, and that was that. â€œBut when the BBC chuck me in the bin â€“ which they will do sooner or later â€“ I will just go back to being a farmer. Thatâ€™s my proper job.â€  Adam and Charlotte have children Ella, whoâ€™s in her early 20s, and Alfie who is 17. The Countryfile star made sure his kids have had a similar, wholesome upbringing to him. He told the publication: â€œMy childhood was so healthy and free. My mum made all our food and cut our hair. â€œIt was like The Waltons. But getting back to nature was always important and my kids have grown up on the farm too. â€œEven though one is going to work at an events company and my son wants to go into finance, they could both lamb a ewe. Theyâ€™re very capable.â€ Countryfile will air on BBC One at 6.15pm on Sunday and last for 55 minutes.

408,"New York City cancels summer festivals, concerts and parades through June",William Feuer@WillFOIABerkeley Lovelace Jr.@BerkeleyJr,"New York City is canceling concerts, festivals and parades, including the 2020 Pride march, through June as the city seeks to drive down its coronavirus infection rate, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday. On Friday, De Blasio canceled nonessential events through May and a city-sponsored concert series that was scheduled start June 22. In extending the cancellations through June, de Blasio said it was a decision ""we have to make."" Most of the events will be rescheduled, he said. ""That joy and that pride that all of these events bring, that celebration, will be back,"" de Blasio said at a press conference, noting that the new cancellations include the 50th annual gay pride parade marking the 1969 uprising at the Stonewall Inn. David Correa, interim executive director of Heritage of Pride, said it wasn't easy to cancel the parade, especially given the economic hit LGBTQIA+ businesses will take from it, ""but our top priority remains the health and well-being of all those that participate with us."" De Blasio said Covid-19 hospitalizations are falling but still high. On Saturday, 212 people were admitted to hospitals for suspected cases, down from 317 on Friday. He said 853 people were in intensive care for Covid-19 on Saturday, up slightly from 849 the previous day. ""This is not a perfect daily report, but it's getting better and it's damn close to what we're looking for,"" he said. De Blasio said public health officials and infectious disease experts are unsure how the next few months will play out, but he reiterated that the pandemic will end at some point. ""What we can say though, one thing we have heard universally is this is a crisis that has an endpoint,"" he said. ""I know it's going to be a tough road. I know it's not going to be simple. I know it's going to be a long road."" De Blasio added that the city is expanding mental health support for families through the spring, saying that it's ""going to be painful"" as children head back to school in the next second year.",0,

The cause behind the rift is that Sobyanin has insisted from the very beginning that strict quarantine must introduced in the capital and has been one of the main supporters of the media hysteria over the COVID-19 threat. Many saw it as a kind of political move to strengthen the power of the circles that include such persons as Moscow major Sergey Sobyanin that includes such controversial persons as Herman Gref (CEO of Sberbank of Russia), Elvira Nabiullina (President of the Central Bank of Russia).

247,BREAKING NOW: SCIENTISTS CONFIRM CORONAVIRUS MAN-MADE…CONTAINS ‘PSHUTTLE-SN’ SEQUENCE PROVING LABORATORY ORIGIN,Info Wars,"Alex Jones breaks down a scientific study showing how the coronavirus has “key structural proteins” of HIV, indicating the virus is man-made and was developed in a laboratory setting. Two days ago, a paper published in the Biorxiv.org journal presented findings that indicated the coronavirus appeared to be engineered with “key structural proteins” of HIV. The paper, entitled, “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120
and Gag,” concluded that the engineering of coronavirus with such gene sequences was “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,” providing strong scientific support for the theory that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon that escaped laboratory containment in China. The coverage of this paper by Zero Hedge led to a firestorm of denials by governments, health authorities and the CIA-controlled media, not surprisingly. Any suggestion that the coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon had to be immediately eliminated. The prevailing panic by the establishment sought to blame this outbreak on Mother Nature — i.e. bats, snakes, seafood, etc. — rather than the human beings who are playing around with deadly biological weapons that are designed to extinguish human life. ithin hours, Twitter slapped down a permanent ban on Zero Hedge, making sure the independent publisher could no longer reach its Twitter audience. After all, the first casualty in any pandemic is the truth, and Jack Dorsey is not only an enabler of pedophiles and child rapists, he’s also an authoritarian tyrant who wants to make sure the public is completely isolated from any “non official” reports about this pandemic. (Jack Dorsey has sided with communist China, in other words. Is anyone surprised?). Under the intense pressure, the authors of the original paper have now withdrawn the paper and intend to revise it. The publication that originally carried the paper now has a warning message stating, “This article has been withdrawn. Click here for details.” (See original source link here.) In addition, the publisher has posted a message warning that all the science papers it posts as “preliminary reports” that “should not be regarded as conclusive,” especially when the science establishment is panicked that its official narratives might be crumbling by the hour. No doubt the authors of this particular paper have been sufficiently threatened to revise their conclusions, and an update of their original paper will soon be posted that effectively denounces everything they stated in the original paper. The criminal wing of the science establishment strikes again, of course, and this tactic of threatening scientists with loss of funding, being blacklisted or even physically threatened and killed is not unusual at all. The CDC, NIH and even the EPA have long histories of threatening scientists with being harmed or killed if they don’t fall in line with the prevailing lies of the establishment. In some cases, they’ve even imprisoned scientists for fraud after those individuals refused to retract their papers. This has been especially common in research areas such as HIV / AIDS, pandemics and vaccines. Any scientist who finds fault with the establishment is destroyed, imprisoned or murdered. PSHUTTLE-SN SEQUENCE PROVES THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC WAS DEFINITELY ENGINEERED IN A LAB
Now, stunning new evidence has emerged that proves the coronavirus was definitely engineered in a laboratory and may have been deliberately injected into patients as part of a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong. As detailed by James Lyons-Weiler, PhD, founder of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge and author of 57 peer-reviewed publications, an analysis of the gene sequence for the coronavirus finds a peculiar sequence called “pShuttle-SN.” This sequence is is the remnant of a genetic engineering sequence that’s used to insert genes into viruses and bacteria. It provides irrefutable “open source” proof that the coronavirus now circulating in the wild was engineered in a laboratory. Every lab that has the gene sequence can see this for themselves. It’s right out in the open, which is why we describe this revelation as “open source.” “One thing we can say for certain is that this particular virus has a laboratory origin,” states Lyons-Weiler in a bombshell interview with Del Bigtree of The Highwire (see video below, via Brighteon.com, since the video would be banned everywhere else). This genomic evidence does not, however, prove whether it was produced as a bioweapon or as a vaccine experiment. It could be either one, according to Lyons-Weiler: In fact, if you then take that sequence and compare it to other proteins, we find that it’s actually a SARS protein that was put into a coronavirus for the purpose of making the vaccine work better. That’s why this element is in there, to create a more reactogenic vaccine. There’s bombshell after bombshell in this interview, especially at the 27:59 and 33:57 marks. Watch it exclusively at Brighteon.com, given that this information is of course being banned everywhere else by the anti-human tech giants, all of which are now siding with communist China to cover up the truth.",1,
224,According to Dr. Anthony Fauci the Reopening of the US Economy Would Endanger People’s Heath,Prof Michel Chossudovsky,"He wants the lockdown to continue, no reopening of the US economy because that would endanger people’s health.

Dr. Fauci intimates that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are dangerous. The evidence is anecdotical, says Fauci. The corporate media presents it as a untested drug.

“The only tool we have right now for fighting the coronavirus is social distancing” says Dr. Fauci. And of course confinement, “stay at home”. Neither of these “recommendations” are medical solutions, i.e. drugs which can be used to prevent and inhibit the infection.

Fauci is opposed to the treatment of COVID-19 using chloroquine.  What he wants is for all of us to be vaccinated.

According to CNN, Trump is to blame: What Fauci fails to mention is that Chloroquine was “studied” and tested fifteen years ago by the CDC as a drug to be used against coronavirus infections. 

According to the NYT,

The federal agency led by Dr. Anthony Fauci issued guidelines on  [April 21] that stated there is no proven drug for treating coronavirus patients” (emphasis added)

The report echoed what frustrated doctors already know: Not enough is known about the highly infectious virus or how to combat it.

“No proven drug”: “Not Enough Known”. Nonsensical and irresponsible statements.

Chloroquine was used in 2002 and tested against SARS-1 coronavirus in a study under the auspices of the CDC published in the Virology Journal.

An August 2005 report in the peer reviewed Virology Journal (summary below) was published in 2005.

The main conclusion of the article was that:  Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread. It was used in the SARS-1 outbreak in 2002. It had the endorsement of the CDC.",1,
39,HOT MIC: Pence Busted Delivering Empty Boxes To Nursing Home,Tasha Williams,"Mike Pence is likely the most useless Vice President ever, and, as if we needed more evidence of that, Pence has made a spectacle of himself on camera. Pence is Trump’s loyal lapdog, always standing just behind the president, nodding and gazing adoringly at his master. This time, Trump wasn’t there, and the entire spotlight was on Pence, which is probably why he forgot he had a mic on.
Pence recently visited a nursing home to deliver PPE or personal protective equipment to staff and patients residing there, but there’s just one small problem.
The boxes were empty.
Jimmy Kimmel Covered the embarrassing snafu last night on his show. The video begins with Pence pushing a cart with two boxes on it. He stops the cart at the entrance of the nursing home and barely manages to unload the boxes at the door. Then Pence returns to the van for more boxes, at which time he is told that they are empty.
Pence, forgetting that he was mic’d, said:
“WELL, CAN I CARRY THE EMPTY ONES, JUST FOR THE CAMERA?”

262,Scientific study reveals more than 40-60 percent of US population has immunity to coronavirus,Anonymous,"A ​new study from scientists in the United States suggests that a significant majority of the population may already have some level of immunity to the coronavirus, a possible explanation for why so many individuals seem to experience few to no symptoms from the disease. The study, written by researchers in California, New York and North Carolina and soon to be published in the journal Cell, discovered that certain types of cells in blood samples taken from donors in 2015-2018—well before COVID-19 arose—were reactive against the COVID-19 virus. In other words, those blood samples were at least partially immune from the coronavirus even though they had never been exposed to it. ""CD4+ T cell responses were detected in 40-60% of unexposed individuals. This may be reflective of some degree of crossreactive, preexisting immunity to SARS- CoV-2 in some, but not all, individuals,"" the researchers state in the paper.  Those individuals who are using the virus situation in America for political benefits might now have their narrative busted, as a scientific study by researchers in California, New York, and North Carolina have revealed a damning study. This study now shows that 40-60 percent of all Americans in the United States likely already have the immunity to coronavirus, as blood samples now revealed to the public show that there is a preexisting immunity to coronavirus in most blood samples conducted in this study have certain types of cells that are reactive against coronavirus. With this study now out in the open showing that Americans have more than a 50 percent chance to the coronavirus in the first place, it's truly time to reopen America and prevent the Democrats form using this hoax virus to put mail in voting into play.",1,
191,Coronavirus tests are a LIE… false positives vastly outnumber real positives … official infection counts wildly overstated,Mike Adams,"The African nation of Tanzania recently sent samples to the WHO for coronavirus testing. Among those items that tested positive for the coronavirus were samples from a goat, a papaya and a pheasant, all at once exposing the total science fraud behind coronavirus testing.

As we’ve warned for over a month, most coronavirus tests produce huge numbers of false positives. The testing kits are largely made in China, and either through gross incompetence or malicious intent, China-made lab tests are notorious for being so inaccurate that they’re practically useless.

Notably, the infamous “Stanford Study” which was seized upon by the conservative media to claim that the coronavirus had already infected a large percentage of the population and therefore wasn’t very deadly also relied in China-made antibody tests that produced huge numbers of false positives. Those who touted the findings of the Stanford Study were actually getting hoodwinked by China, it turns out. And similar antibody tests have been run in New York, allowing Cuomo to spread total disinformation to the public, claiming somewhere around 14% of all New Yorkers have already been infected with the virus. We now have enough knowledge of the “false positives” testing fiasco to be able to say, with confidence, that the official coronavirus infection numbers are wildly over-stated. Nowhere near that number of people have actually been infected.
And that means the coronavirus is far more deadly than what people are being led to believe.


And we actually have a way to take a good guess at the degree by which those infection numbers are over-inflated.

We already know that many of these kits produce somewhere around 10 false positives per 100 people tested, or a 10% false positive rate (many kits are far worse). We can also intelligently estimate that right now somewhere around 2% of the US population has actually been infected. This is a rough estimate, but as you’ll see below, whether this is 1% or 4% doesn’t change the conclusions by much.

Now, if you test 100 people for the coronavirus, and 2 out of those 100 actually have the coronavirus, but the test kits you’re using have a false positive rate of 10 out of 100, then you will get, essentially 12 positives out of 100.

Notably, 10 of those positives are false, and 2 are real. This means the false positives are 500% higher than the real positives. And if you rely on those findings, you would incorrectly think that 500% more people have been infected than actually have. This is precisely what the Stanford Study did. They ran tests that produced false positives, then they extrapolated that false finding to the entire population of California. From that, they incorrectly concluded that a huge percentage of California had already been infected, and therefore the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of the coronavirus was very, very small. As we show in this Natural News article, Stanford researchers likely produced 13 false positives for every 1 real positive.

That entire conclusion falls apart when you realize the testing kits they used were made in China. In fact, those particular kits were so unreliable that Stanford researchers tried to hide the origins of the kits in their paper, but internet sleuths found out the kits were actually made by Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, a company that ranked last place in testing kit accuracy. As ExtremeTech.com explained:

At the time Stanford did the study, there weren’t any FDA-approved COVID-19 antibody tests for clinical use. But for research purposes, the team purchased tests from Premier Biotech in Minnesota. Premier has started marketing a COVID-19 antibody test, but it doesn’t create it. The test listed on the company’s website, and that it appears Stanford used, is from Hangzhou Biotest Biotech, an established Chinese lab test vendor.

It also turned out that the Wall Street Journal writer who touted the stunning findings of the paper was one of the paper co-authors who failed to identify his obvious conflict of interest. So the entire study — and the subsequent WSJ editorial coverage of it — was a rigged scam, 100% science fraud parading around as breaking news to try to deceive America into thinking the coronavirus was no real danger at all. It was a propaganda con job, and sadly, most of the pro-Trump independent media fell for it and repeated the bad conclusions, misinforming their own audiences and causing many people to believe the virus was “no more dangerous than the flu.” So what does all this really mean in a practical sense? Here are the bullet points of the rational conclusions:

The infection numbers are wildly over-stated due to false positives from bogus testing kits.
This means the infection fatality rates are under-stated, since far fewer people have been infected than we were led to believe.
It also means that herd immunity is far off, since the actual percentage of people who have been infected is much smaller than what researchers have been reporting. In truth, the real number of infections may be just 1/10th what researchers have estimated (or even lower). Any attempt to leap across the chasm and try to rapidly achieve herd immunity in the USA will result in disaster (and mass death).
This also means that reopening economies without taking proper precautions — such as wearing masks, which can end the pandemic if just 80% of the people participate — will lead to a catastrophic second round of infections and deaths.
Finally, and perhaps most worryingly, this means that people are being told they’ve already been infected and are therefore immune and can go back to work. When, in reality, most of those people have never been infected at all. This will result in many people having a false sense of security, which would likely lead many of these people to avoid taking adequate precautions such as wearing masks.
In effect, the result of bad tests producing false positives is mass confusion and the gross mis-allocation of resources to fight the pandemic. If that sounds like the precise scenario that communist China would be trying to unleash across America as part of a biological warfare playbook, you’re exactly right.

That’s why we believe the false positive test kits are deliberately manufactured to be faulty as a way for China to magnify the spread of the coronavirus pandemic outside of China as part of its multiple waves of biological warfare against the West.

Almost certainly, China reserved the accurate kits for itself while exporting known “bad” kits to nations like the United States, all while pressuring the WHO to claim there was no pandemic at all. ",1,
474,UPDATE 2-Euro zone bond yields dip as bleak German data fans economy fears,,"* Euro zone bond yields lower * German GDP data fans recession fears in powerhouse economy * Italian yields off 4-month lows (Updates throughout) LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Most government bond yields across the euro area edged lower on Friday, after bleak economic data from Germany added to concerns about the bloc's economic outlook. Italian yields were broadly higher, with its bonds underperforming the broader euro zone market, following the latest signs of unrest in the ruling coalition government. Data showed the German economy stagnated in the fourth quarter due to weaker private consumption and state spending, renewing fears of a recession just as Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are preoccupied with a search for a new leader. The European Union's statistics office said GDP in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the October-December period, as announced on Jan 31, for a 0.9% year-on-year gain - a downward revision from the previously estimated 1.0% growth. ""We are now getting a change in tone in markets and more concern about the growth outlook,"" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a rates strategist at Rabobank in London. ""But I'm not sure that's been fully priced in yet."" While economic data late last year suggested the worst may be over for the euro zone economy, the coronavirus outbreak has fuelled concerns about the outlook. Market inflation expectations are once again pointing downwards. A Reuters poll of economists indicated the Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter due to the effect of the virus. Most 10-year bond yields in the euro area were 1-2 basis points (bps) lower on the day . Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was down 1.5 bps at -0.41%. It is down 22 bps so far this year, French and Dutch yields are roughly 28 bps lower each. Given that China is the world's second biggest economy, its stumble is likely to hold back growth elsewhere, prompting central banks to step in and inject further liquidity into financial markets, creating more demand for government bonds. But economists say the downturn should be short-lived and the rebound quick if the outbreak is contained. New cases outside China's Hubei region, the heart of the outbreak, declined for the 10th consecutive day on Thursday. ""Difficulties in assessing the (coronavirus) situation have resulted in volatile, but sideways, moves in rates,"" said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING. ""Recent days have proven that the case count should be taken with a pinch of salt, as it is inherently polluted by diagnostic difficulties."" Italy's 10-year bond yield, which fell to its lowest level in around four months on Thursday, was slightly higher on the day at 0.91%. Analysts said appetite for Italian debt may also have been impacted slightly by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying Italy's government could collapse after his small party boycotted a cabinet meeting over a contested justice reform. Renzi's centrist Italia Viva party is in the coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), but he has constantly taken centre stage in coalition bickering since it was formed last September.

284,Coronavirus: OOIDA CEO Todd Spencer on the help truck drivers need,Kevin Stankiewicz@kevin_stank,"The U.S. economy needs truck drivers, yet the economic and health risks they face during the coronavirus pandemic haven't been addressed yet, according to the CEO of an industry group. ""Realistically, truckers are first responders. Our whole economy runs on trucks,"" Todd Spencer, president and CEO of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, told CNBC's Kelly Evans on Monday. ""Everything that we need, the vital things in the stores, they only get there by truck,"" Spencer added on ""The Exchange."" However, Spencer said government relief efforts so far ""have generally gone over the top of truckers."" He said that while 96% of truckers work in fleets that contain 20 or fewer trucks, programs created to aid small businesses during the Covid-19 outbreak ""really miss them completely."" Truckers are experiencing a squeeze on the rate they receive to haul goods, Spencer said. The rate has ""pretty much been cut in half,"" he said, limiting any potential benefits to a lower cost of fuel. ""They're facing a real economic crisis to be able to continue to operate, not to mention the fact that they actually are on the front line in the battle against coronavirus,"" Spencer said. ""They really are critical. They go everywhere. They go into the hot zones,"" Spencer said. President Donald Trump on Thursday held an event at the White House focused on the role truck drivers play in the U.S. economy. Earlier this month, Spencer's organization wrote a letter to Trump, in which Spencer discussed the need for Covid-19 testing for truckers and plans to quarantine drivers who may be infected while on the road. ""We don't think it's realistic that the only option they have is to quarantine in a truck. We think far more could be done there,"" Spencer said Monday. Drivers are increasingly concerned about their health, Spencer said, adding the number of them who are exposed and get infected with Covid-19 is likely going to rise. For those reasons, he said he believes there should be greater efforts made to provide drivers with personal protective equipment, which hopefully helps them avoid infection and stay on the job. ""That's been a challenge. We understand FEMA is stepping up some to provide some of that, but we haven't seen it yet,"" he said. FEMA did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",0,

402,Google launches Cloud Healthcare API in general availability,Kyle Wiggers,"Google today announced the launch in general availability of Cloud Healthcare API, a service that facilitates the exchange of data between health care applications and solutions built on Google Cloud. The API allows organizations to ingest and manage data from a range of inputs and systems, and then to analyze that data through the use of privacy-preserving AI and machine learning. Cloud Healthcare API could help relieve the strain on health systems overburdened by the coronavirus pandemic. As Google notes, even in the best of circumstances, collating data is often a challenge for health care and life science organizations. The API, then, enables providers to interact with data using endpoints and health plans that scale while supporting interoperability, security, and patient access. Cloud Healthcare API â€” a managed, scalable environment for building clinical and analytics applications that support HIPAA compliance â€” incorporates a number of data-loss prevention, policy, identity management, and encryption solutions. Customers can choose the region where their data is stored, and they get management policies that let them implement practices like the principle of least privilege. And thanks to the APIâ€™s integration with Cloud Audit Logs, they can track all actions that affect their data. Cloud Healthcare API ships with connectors for streaming data processing in Google products like Dataflow, BigQuery, AI Platform, and Looker. Beyond this, it features an automated de-identification capability that removes or obfuscates personal information from corpora so they can be used for analysis, training, and evaluating machine learning models and for sharing with non-privileged parties, while protecting patient privacy. â€œWith â€¦ Cloud Healthcare API and our partner ecosystem, our goal is to make it as simple as possible for the industry to make informed, data-driven decisions, so that caregivers can focus on what matters most: saving lives,â€ wrote Google in a blog post and product page. â€œWith Google Cloudâ€™s â€¦ analytics and machine learning tools, you can simplify custom machine learning model training, and rapidly develop, test, and deploy production-grade ML models. You can also leverage Cloud Healthcare APIâ€™s â€¦ [tools] to store the outputs of these [machine learning] models and integrate them into existing clinical workflows.â€  Google says that the Mayo Clinic has been relying on the Cloud Healthcare API for the better part of a year to â€œenable the storage and interoperability of its clinical data.â€ Cloud Healthcare APIâ€™s public launch comes a year after the serviceâ€™s debut in beta and two years after its initial unveiling, a timeline roughly coinciding with a push by the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information to encourage the use of APIs to promote health care interoperability, as a part of the 2016 21st Century Cures Act. Recently, Googleâ€™s efforts were impeded somewhat by a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inquiry into its partnership with health care nonprofit Ascension, in which the latter shared millions of patient records with a team of Google employees for research purposes. Microsoft offers something of a rival to Cloud Healthcare API in an Azure API that enables organizations to connect and interact with any system that supports the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. For its part, Amazon Web Services boasts products like Amazon Comprehend Medical, which leverages machine learning to extract relevant medical information from unstructured text.",0,
337,FOREX-Dollar gains from safe-haven scramble as virus rattles markets,,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E * ECB did not follow Fed, BoE in cutting rates * Traders watch equity market melt down * Policymakers struggle with coronavirus response TOKYO, March 13 (Reuters) - The dollar stood tall on Friday as investors scrambled for the world's most liquid currency amid deepening panic about the coronavirus, while the euro nursed losses after the European Central Bank disappointed by not cutting rates. The greenback held gains against most currencies after a blowout in swap spreads showed investors are facing a shortage of dollars as equity markets plunged on fears about the global economic impact of the flu-like virus. The ECB on Thursday unveiled a stimulus package that provides loans to banks with rates as low as -0.75% and increases bond purchases. The Federal Reserve moved to provide $1.5 trillion in short-term liquidity and changed the durations of Treasuries it buys, but money markets show investors expect the Fed will have to go even further to restore calm to financial markets. The government in Italy, which has become Europe's hot spot for coronavirus infections, has effectively put the entire country on lockdown to try to slow the virus. Investors have so far expressed disappointment with the government response to rising infections in the United States, and traders warn there could be more disruptions in a broad range of financial markets. ""Risk off used to benefit the yen, but now we see that risk off is supporting the dollar,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager of the research department at Gaitame.com Research Institute in Tokyo. ""We are in panic mode, because we don't know how far stocks will fall."" The euro traded at $1.1202, following a 0.72% decline on Thursday in the wake of the ECB decision. For the week, the common currency was on course for a 0.7% decline. Against the pound, the dollar rose slightly to $1.2541 in Asia on Friday, which followed its biggest one-day gain against sterling since July 2016. The dollar was up 3.8% against sterling this week, its best performance since October 2016. The greenback held gains against the Swiss franc, trading at 0.9435, headed for a 0.7% weekly gain. The ECB rolled out yet another stimulus package on Thursday to help fight the coronavirus pandemic but did not join its counterparts in the United States and Britain by cutting rates. Investors, who had bet the ECB could cut rates at least 10 basis points and possibly more, were disappointed. ECB President Christine Lagarde also aggravated a market selloff by saying it was not the central bank's job to close the spread between the borrowing costs of various members, comments which she later tried to roll back. Authorities are rushing to introduce travel bans, extra financial liquidity and monetary easing as the rapid spread of the virus across the world slams the brakes on the global economy. The dollar rose 0.88% to 105.58 yen on Friday, on course for a 0.2% weekly advance. With signs of financial stress emerging across different markets, the New York Federal Reserve said it would make the money available in three tranches of $500 billion each and that it would start purchasing a broader range of U.S. Treasury securities. The Fed meets next week and many analysts now expect the central bank to chop its own target policy rate, quite possibly to zero, and give markets new guidance about how it plans to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus. The Bank of Japan, which will announce a policy decision next week Thursday after the Fed, announced the unscheduled purchase of 200 billion yen ($1.90 billion) in government debt on Friday. It also said it would inject an additional 1.5 trillion yen in two-week lending in a sign of concern that liquidity could dry up. Cross-currency basis swap spreads for the yen and the pound blew out in what traders say is a sign of a dollar shortage. Highlighting the sense of crisis, senior officials from the Group of Seven talked on Thursday and confirmed they will cooperate closely as equities tumble and corporate bond spreads widen. The Canadian dollar rose slightly to C$1.3894 against the greenback, pulling back from a four-year low. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife has tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said. Trudeau is not showing any symptoms but will stay in isolation for 14 days, according to his office. The Australian and New Zealand dollars managed to bounce more than half a percent against the greenback in Asian trade. The antipodeans were mauled on Thursday as investors shunned riskier currencies that are linked to the global commodities trade. The Reserve Bank of Australia also injected an unusually large amount of cash into the financial system on Friday as panic spread.

249,The Gates / Fauci Vaccine Developed by Moderna. Video Featuring Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Andrew Kaufman,Lila York,"Most of the vaccines currently under process by big pharma are likewise mRNA vaccines, a type never before used on humans. The Gates/Fauci vaccine against covid-19 is no ordinary vaccine. It uses three needles, two of which are electrodes that will alter the DNA of every cell in the body. Gates and Fauci have bypassed all required phase-one animal testing, normally a 10-year testing requirement, as well as human safety testing. This assault on our bodies will likely be issued as mandatory, since it is being developed under emergency powers. Trump’s attorney, Alan Dershowitz, has stated categorically that “you have no constitutional right to refuse a vaccine”. Republicans amended the Democrat’s bill to track and surveil all Americans in our homes. Their main concern about this latest stimulus bill (which includes the HR 6666 Trace Act) is to indemnify those doctors who may injure you with the countless mandatory vaccines being planned.

In other words, neither party is demonstrating any interest in protecting the health or civil liberties of American citizens. They are interested in protecting the profits of insurance companies.

There now exist five proven cures for this virus, in wide use throughout the world but falsely maligned in the US, all of which are safe, effective, cheap and available. (IV Vitamin C, Interferon alpha B, ivermectin, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and hydroxychloroquine and zinc, which has been in use safely for 30 years)

Big Pharma cannot make money from any of the proven cures – which explains their temper tantrums and demand for useless but expensive vaccines. Useless, because in 30 years of research scientists have never been able to create a corona virus vaccine that worked and was safe for humans.

For a more detailed scientific analysis of the profound hazards of mRNA vaccines, I include this from a colleague in the gene modification field.

An RNA vaccine like this has never been approved for human use but it has been successfully used with animals. But the bar is much lower for animals – you don’t care if a few die. This is a risky approach. They take the genome of the virus and then snip out the mRNA for just the S protein which binds to ACE2.

Then they use a vector to get the mRNA into the human cells so it is expressed and some cells will translate the mRNA’s codons into the amino acid peptide of the S protein and present it on the cell surface.

Those S proteins will be detected by the IgM antibody on a B-Cell surface and start the cascade of events that leads to production of protective IgG antibodies. The human cells will be seen as infected and will be killed. So you do lose a little bit of tissue. Some will feel as if they have the flu. You hope the correct mRNA is included and you don’t accidentally introduce the whole genome of the virus. And the IgG will probably last for two years. But if you get ADE after the virus mutates then this could result in a much worse illness later on. But we don’t know if ADE will happen. Generally a safer method is to just produce S protein on a wet bench and inject just the S protein to form an immune response but when this was tried with SARS it made the disease worse not better. Live attenuated viruses were tested for SARS but they reverted to wild type and killed the host. Risky stuff!",1,

They also alleged a failure to keep plans adequately updated so they could formulate contingency plans. The source claimed the Government failed to replenish personal protective equipment (PPE). A December 2017 plan had arranged for the NHS to be able to draw on stockpiles. According to the Sunday Times, the supply of this equipment had dwindled and some equipment was out of date.

On Saturday evening, the Department of Health and Social Care announced on Twitter that researchers at Queenâ€™s University Belfast were using 3D printers and laser cutters to create protective face shields. Coronavirus was first detected in China on November 17 according to documents seen by Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post.  The newspaper says Chinese doctors only understood they were dealing with a new illness in late December. The epicentre of the virus has now spread to Europe and North America. Many countries around the world have introduced a variety of lockdown procedures to prevent the spread of infection.  In the UK, the current lockdown will last for at least another three weeks before it is reviewed. A Downing Street spokesman said: â€œOur response has ensured that the NHS has been given all the support it needs to ensure everyone requiring treatment has received it, as well as providing protection to businesses and reassurance to workers.  â€œThe prime minister has been at the helm of the response to this, providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation.â€ See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",0,
415,Coronavirus: US shoe imports from China see worst January in decade,Lauren Thomas@laurenthomas,"First there was the trade war. Then, the coronavirus struck. U.S. footwear imports from China just had their worst January in more than a decade, Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, told CNBC in an interview. The 15.7% drop was also the worst year-over-year decline in four years, he said. A whopping 70% of shoes sold in the U.S. come from China, according to the industry organization, which has more than 500 members, including Walmart, Nike, Crocs and Steven Madden.  The footwear industry was already dealing with an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, when the spread of the coronavirus began in China, prompting quarantines and shuttered factories. Though trade tensions eased somewhat in late 2019, Priest said shoe companies are still mitigating the duties they must pay on footwear imported from Asia. ""The virus is now going to coexist with the trade war,"" he said. ""Just because the coronavirus is here does not mean the tariffs are going away."" Many shoe makers had already started to diversify their supply chains and reduce their reliance on China as a result of the higher tariffs. Companies including Nike, Under Armour and Puma have steadily been shifting resources to places such as Vietnam. ""That was one benefit of getting caught up in a trade war,"" Priest said. Still, these businesses will inevitably take a hit from the coronavirus, as evidenced by the slowing rate of imports to kick off 2020. Adidas said Wednesday it expected first-quarter sales to drop by up to 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) in greater China, and operating profit to decline by between 400 million and 500 million euros, because of the new coronavirus. That was after the company last month warned that its business in the greater China area had dropped by about 85%, year over year, in the period since the Lunar New Year on Jan. 25. Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted is referring to the spread of COVID-19 as ""a painful setback"" for the company's business, as it is already seeing traffic declines at some of its shops. It has not yet factored a hit into its full-year outlook. Under Armour in February said it anticipated the outbreak in China to lower sales by roughly $50 million to $60 million during its fiscal first quarter. That was, notably, before the virus started to hit Europe and North America much harder. Nike is expected to discuss the virus when it reports earnings on March 24. While consumers might yet notice any shortage of shoes on shelves, that could change if this situation drags on, FDRA's Priest said. He said many retailers had stockpiled goods from China ahead of the Chinese New Year, preparing for that period of time when factories normally shut down in celebration of the holiday. That gave many businesses ""inventory to play with,"" as factories went dark because of quarantines. But if manufacturing does not get back up and running soon, it could begin to impact the back-to-school or even holiday shopping seasons, he said. ""I did not expect [January imports] to be that low.""",0,
306,"Canada, U.S. extend border restrictions 30 days to control coronavirus spread - Reuters",Rod Nickel,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada and the United States have agreed to extend border restrictions for another 30 days to help control the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday. Washington and Ottawa agreed last month to clamp down on non-essential travel while allowing trade to continue across their long shared frontier during the coronavirus outbreak. The restrictions were due to expire next week. Trudeau said the agreement is unchanged, and he expected shipments of medical supplies such as masks to continue to cross the border. President Donald Trump issued a memorandum this month that directed federal agencies to keep highly sought-after medical supplies in the United States. U.S. manufacturing company 3M Co reached a deal with the Trump administration, however, allowing it to continue to export masks to Canada and Latin America. Canadaâ€™s death toll from COVID-19, the respiratory disease associated with the new coronavirus, rose 8% to 1,346 deaths, a government website said. Reported cases climbed 6% to 32,412. Quebec is the epicenter of Canadaâ€™s outbreak, with seniors in care homes accounting for most of the provinceâ€™s 805 deaths. Canada was sending the army into the province starting Saturday to help alleviate staffing shortages in Quebecâ€™s care facilities for seniors. Ontario, the most populous province, surpassed 10,000 cases and reached 514 deaths, second-highest in Canada. Some western provinces, by contrast, have seen daily tallies of new cases level off. British Columbia and Saskatchewan have said they are starting to plan for loosening restrictions. Alberta, the countryâ€™s main producer of oil and cattle, has seen daily cases increase in the past week as it boosted testing. An outbreak of 358 cases linked to a Cargill Ltd beef plant in High River, Alberta, has also swelled numbers, it said on Friday. Trudeau said Canada would support aboriginal businesses with C$306 million in interest-free loans and nonrepayable contributions. In total, Ottawa has unveiled C$115 billion  ($82.15 billion) in direct spending to help companies and individuals deal with shutdowns. Highlighting the economyâ€™s vulnerability, Ottawa on Saturday said it would scrutinize foreign investments more closely, especially those by state-owned enterprises into companies that supply critical goods. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Canada wants to avert opportunistic investors taking advantage of weak company valuations, due to the pandemic. On Friday, the Liberal government announced C$2.5 billion in aid for the hard-hit energy sector. Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Sandra Maler",0,

On Tuesday morning, the president retweeted a video that showed director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, at a White House news conference on Friday. As many know, Dr. Fauci often speaks at the conferences because he's a key member of of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. However, in this particular video, Dr. Fauci is shown reacting to Trump's words. In the clip, Trump can be heard calling the State Department ""the Deep State Department.""

359,South Korean e-commerce firm Coupang stretched by order surge as coronavirus cases jump - Reuters,"Joyce Lee, Heekyong Yang","INCHEON, South Korea (Reuters) - As South Koreaâ€™s coronavirus cases leapt above 5,000 this week, mask-wearing workers at a logistics center run by e-commerce firm Coupang Corp raced to disinfect trucks and load thousands of boxes of microwavable rice, disposable diapers and kitchen towels. â€œIn the past, we used to go out with the truck half full, but these days, thereâ€™s so much to deliver there are leftover packages after filling the truck completely,â€ 27-year-old Jung Im-hong, a contract delivery driver, told Reuters. Even before the epidemic, South Korea was expected to become the worldâ€™s No. 3 e-commerce market this year after China and the United States, according to Euromonitor, a remarkable statistic for a nation of just 51.7 million. Now as the country emerges as critical hotspot in the global epidemic with the most cases outside China, its shift to online shopping is only gathering speed. Coupang, which has secured $3 billion in investment from SoftBank (9984.T) and its Vision Fund, has seen deliveries climb to 3 million daily since mid-February from around 2.2 million per day late last year. But the surge in orders, mostly for low-margin goods such as household items and fresh produce, may be a double-edged sword as delivery costs also balloon, potentially setting the 10-year old firm even further back in its quest for profitability, analysts said. â€œItâ€™s difficult, thereâ€™s so much to deliver,â€ said Yoo Min-hyuck, who oversees one of Coupangâ€™s logistics centers in Incheon. For each shift, the center can now call on about 100 part-time workers, who use their own cars to handle overflow, whereas previously about half that number would line up for work. Founded by 41-year-old Harvard graduate Bom Kim, Coupang made a splash with its â€˜Rocket Deliveryâ€™ service that promised delivery within 24 hours and dealt a sharp blow to the countryâ€™s family-owned retail conglomerates including Shinsegae and Lotte. Lotte Shopping Co Ltd (023530.KS) announced last month it will close about 200 of its 700 offline stores in the next 3-5 years. At the time of the Vision Fundâ€™s $2 billion investment in late 2018, Coupang was valued at around $9 billion. But Coupangâ€™s history suggests that the more it sells, the more losses it makes. Although revenue soared 65% to 4.4 trillion won in 2018, operating losses expanded 72% to 1.1 trillion won, according to its latest public filing. And established players are not going quietly: Shinsegae, which owns countryâ€™s largest big-box store chain E-Mart Inc (139480.KS), last year set up a dedicated e-commerce unit and a logistics center with a built-in bakery. It must also compete with eBay Incâ€™s (EBAY.O) South Korean unit and online search portal Naver Corp (035420.KS) which has partnered with a multitude of independent online shopping malls to become the national leader in e-commerce market share, according to Seoul-based SK Securities. The competition with cash-rich players could be an uphill battle for Coupang, said Han Tae-il, analyst at Korea Investors Service, a unit of credit rating agency Moodyâ€™s. â€œFor Coupang to keep holding on, it may need more funding before long,â€ he said. The company declined to comment on when it may reach breakeven point or whether it will soon need more financing. When asked about possible IPO plans, a spokeswoman said Coupang does not have a concrete plan to conduct an offering at this moment. Whatâ€™s clear, however, is that the coronavirus outbreak is having an unprecedented impact on the e-commerce market in Asia as millions are either being forced to work from home or are choosing to. â€œAnd this is placing a tremendous strain on e-commerce markets as well as suppliers of daily goods,â€ said Jared Conway, head of research at Euromonitor International, adding that the epidemic could permanently change how consumers think about what they order online. Demand has skyrocketed so much, especially in Daegu, the South Korean city with the most coronavirus cases, that deliverymen often receive thank-you notes and sometimes gifts from customers. Coupang deliveryman Jung, wiping the sweat off his brow as he loaded bottled water into the truck, said heâ€™s just focused on getting necessities to people isolated at home - despite the worries of his wife, with whom heâ€™s had a new baby. â€œCustomers use us a lot because they canâ€™t leave the house,â€ he said. â€œI think it would have been harder for people without same-day delivery service.â€ Reporting by Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang; Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edwina Gibbs",0,
205,"Сoronavirus may be a product of US ‘biological attack’ aimed at Iran & China, IRGC chief claims",Anonymous,"The US сould be the prime culprit behind Covid-2019 outbreak that hit China and then Iran, head of its elite Revolutionary Guards claimed, threatening that the virus will eventually be turned against those who unleashed it.
“It is possible that this virus is a product of a biological attack by America which initially spread to China and then to Iran and the rest of the world,"" Hossein Salami said on Thursday.

He vowed that Iran would ""fight"" the virus and cautioned that the illness ""will return"" to the United States, if Washington was indeed responsible for the outbreak.

Though such conspiracy theories have been circulating for a while, there's still no official proof it could be true. The Head of Iran’s Civil Defense Organization, General Gholam Reza Jalali, said earlier on Tuesday that media fear-mongering over the new corornavirus in the country bolsters claims that the virus is a biological attack on China and Iran. He said that some reports indicate that it could be a hostile state, but added that his suspicion requires laboratorial investigation and a study of the virus genome.

Iran has been one of the countries hit hardest by Covid-19 outside of mainland China where it originated. As of Thursday, the Islamic Republic has reported 3,513 confirmed cases and 107 deaths attributed to the virus. Some 15 of those who have succumbed to the coronavirus died in the last 24 hours, according to Iran's Health Minister Saeed Namaki.

The country has shuttered all schools and universities until the end of the country's calendar year on March 20 in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.",1,

She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated.

A statement by the researchers said Elisa had complications few hours after taking the vaccine and died while on admission.
Elisa Granato, who is a scientist, was one of the two who received the jab. Four other volunteer are said to be battling complications due to adverse reactions of the vaccine.

Officials say the four persons are being monitored against any adverse effects of the vaccine.

After taking her shot, Elisa Granato told the BBC: “I’m a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can.”

Researchers who are awaiting for an autopsy to be conducted believe the Elisa had an underlying health condition which was not disclosed to health officials.

“The four in critical conditions will be fine and these are expected reactions from the vaccines, hence a trial.” the researchers revealed and added that these observations would help improve on the vaccine before it becomes available for use by the public.",1,
41,Pelosi Actually Slowed Coronavirus Funding so Dems Could Campaign On It,Ken Webster jr,"You never let a serious crisis go to waste."" - Rahm Emanuel
A new report details how Speaker of the House Anonymouscy Pelosi delayed funding allocated to helping prevent the spread of the coronavirus because she knew Democrat candidates running for office could exploit the situation as a campaign talking point.
Elizabeth Vaughn reports:
Speaking withFox News’Laura Ingraham on Monday night, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, “Look how much politics they want to play.The dirty little secret.We have the coronavirus. We need to fund this. You know what Anonymouscy Pelosi, the Speaker, did? She withheld the bill last week. You know why? So the DCCC could run ads against seven Republicans.”
Ingraham asked, “How many people ran ads on the coronavirus, fundraising appeals?”
“I don’t know how many ran, but they actually took the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, spent money, went into these seven Republican seats to campaign against them about the coronavirus when she’s the Speaker of the House. Instead of putting America first, she put her politics first and kept the bill from coming to the floor,” McCarthy explained.
Sadly the coronavirus is just a tragedy worth exploiting to liberal and progressive lawmakers.
At a press conference on Wednesday McCarthy said:
Last week, we had an opportunity to bring forth the Supplemental, the needed funds for public health and others to deal with this item. We are not the majority. We cannot determine the floor, so Speaker Pelosi left, and had us leave Congress. This week, we hope we’re going to be able to bring it up.
The one concerning issue that I have, not as just the leader of the Republicans, but really as an American. Why didn’t we vote on it last week? And why now is the Democratic arm of the DCCC running ads against seven Republicans? On something they could not vote on, because they could not control it. Are they playing politics and holding the money up so their political arm can attack Republicans on this issue? Can they, for one time put people before politics? I think they owe the American people an apology. I think the Speaker needs to apologize. Cheri Bustos needs to take those ads down and stop playing politics with this.
America is nervous. We’ve been preparing for years in advance. We’ve got to make sure we have all the needed resources there.
So bring the bill to the floor.
That's a great question. What's the hold up?!
Earlier in the conference, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR), spoke and said that Democrats were trying to include HR3 (Elijah Cummings’ Lower Drug Costs Now Act) with the bill for coronavirus funding. HR3 is a very controversial bill which will require some debate. Walden basically said, let’s keep this separate, because the funds to fight the coronavirus crisis are needed now.
And there it is - Democrats would rather let people die than do the right thing.",1,

He told fans he was writing every day and ""spending more time in Westeros than in the real world"". George reassured fans that he was feeling ""fine"" at the moment but was self-isolating as a precaution. He said: ""Strange days are upon us. As ancient as I am, I cannot recall ever having lived through anything like the past few weeks."" The best-selling author continued: ""For those of you who may be concerned for me personallyâ€¦ yes, I am aware that I am very much in the most vulnerable population, given my age and physical condition. ""But I feel fine at the moment, and we are taking all sensible precautions.""  He told fans he was in a ""remote isolated location"" and only in contact with one member of staff. The writer has been making the most of time in isolation by throwing himself into his work.

378,Coronavirus infection rate UK: What is the rate of infection for COVID-19 in the UK? | UK | News | Express.co.uk,Liam Doyle," COVID-19 has arced through most of the world in 2020, causing an unprecedented global health catastrophe with thousands of casualties, millions in lockdown and billions in costs. The virus was facilitated by a high rate of infection at first, with people making regular contact with one another facilitating its spread. Rate of infection refers to the percentage of people in any given population who might contract a disease during circulation. Experts calculate the percentage by dividing the number of infections by the number of people at risk of developing it. According to graphs from Austrian health minister Rudolf Anschober, the rate has hovered around roughly two to three percent in Europe. READ MORE: New lockdown rules: What are new coronavirus lockdown rules for UK?    In the UK, however, the rate has exceeded some countries in the bloc by nearly three times. Announcing the new figures in a press conference, Mr Anschober revealed the country's ""frightening"" rate of 7.5 percent. Several countries, amongst them Spain and Italy, have reported a gradual decline in cases, which without UK outliers would suggest the virus is receding from the continent. Dr Hans Kluge, World Health Organisation director for Europe, said COVID-19 has survived in several European boltholes, singling out Britain, Belarus and Russia.   He said: ""Of the 10 countries in the region with the highest numbers of cases, there have been optimistic signs in terms of the climbing numbers in Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland in recent weeks. ""But small positive signals in some countries are tempered by sustained or increased levels of incidents in other countries, including in the UK, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia."" Dr Kluge added the bloc is in the midst of a ""storm"". He said: ""The next few weeks will be critical for Europe.""

498,Prince William reveals huge donation as he gives Captain Tom Moore royal seal of approval | Royal | News | Express.co.uk,Aurora Bosotti," Prince William confirmed he contributed an undisclosed amount to the campaign hero war veteran Captain Tom Moore launched last week in support of NHS staff. Captain Moore pledged to take 100 laps of his garden to raise funds for medics battling the coronavirus pandemic, ending up with over Â£17 million in donations within days. Speaking to the BBC, the Duke of Cambridge said: ""He's an absolute legend. ""Itâ€™s incredible, I did see him on the news the other night and I thought, â€˜good on him.â€™ Itâ€™s amazing. ""What I love also is heâ€™s a 99-year-old war vet, heâ€™s been around a long time, knows everything and itâ€™s wonderful everyone has been inspired by his story and his determination."" Prince William earlier this week joined Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall in congratulating Captain Moore for his efforts with a private letter. Kensington Palace confirmed the duke had made a personal donation to the campaign on Thursday. The Palace did not disclose how much the royal donated. JUST IN: Prince William heartbreak: Duke feared for dad Charles' life after coronavirus diagnosis   Captain Moore had originally set out to raise Â£1,000 to donate to NHS charities in support of staff caring for coronavirus patients. But the Yorkshire-born veteran won over the solidarity and generosity of the whole country, raising over Â£17 million well before his April 30 deadline. His success has sparked calls for the Queen, whom Captain Moore described as ""marvellous and perfect"", to knight the heroic campaigner ahead of his 100th birthday at the end of the month. Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge joined forces with the NHS by narrating a short film about the importance of looking after one's mental health during the pandemic. READ MORE: Kate Middleton and Prince William: How Cambridges are supporting frontline responders  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have both been longtime advocates for open discussion on mental health and have been leading several campaigns to promote a better understanding of the issue.

527,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks crumble, unconvinced as Fed and peers attempt radical rescue",,"rescue@ * Fed cuts rates to 0-0.25% in emergency move * Major central banks offer U.S. dollar funding to break logjam * Dollar pares losses, up on emerging/commodity currencies * S&P 500 futures limit down, oil prices slip * Asian stock markets : https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 SYDNEY, March 16 (Reuters) - Stock markets and the dollar were roiled on Monday after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates in an emergency move and its major peers offered cheap U.S. dollars to ease a ruinous logjam in global lending markets. The Bank of Japan was holding an emergency meeting of its own to discuss new stimulus measures, though options are limited given rates are already negative. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said G7 leaders would hold a teleconference at 1400 GMT to discuss the crisis. The drastic maneuvers were aimed at cushioning the economic impact as the breakneck spread of the coronavirus all but shut down more countries, though they had only limited success in calming panicky investors. Data out of China also underscored just how much economic damage the disease had already done to the world's second-largest economy, with official numbers showing the worst drops in activity on record. Industrial output plunged 13.5% and retail sales 20.5%. ""By any historical standard, the scale and scope of these actions was extraordinary,"" said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income, who helps manage $1.3 trillion in assets. ""This is dramatic action and truly does represent a bazooka."" ""Even so, markets were expecting extraordinary action, so it remains to be seen whether the announcement will meaningfully shift market sentiment."" He emphasized investors wanted to see a lot more U.S. fiscal stimulus put to work and evidence the Trump administration was responding vigorously and effectively to the public health challenges posed by the crisis. ""The performance of the economy and the markets will be mainly determined by the severity and duration of the virus' outbreak."" The jury seemed to be out on that with E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index down 4.77% to their daily trading limit outside the United States. EUROSTOXXX 50 futures fell 2.8% and FTSE futures 1.7%. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 3.1% to lows not seen since early 2017, while the Nikkei eased a relatively mild 0.14%. Shanghai blue chips fell 1.4% even as China's central bank surprised with a fresh round of liquidity injections into the financial system. New Zealand's central bank also shocked by cutting rates 75 basis points to 0.25%, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) pumped more money into a strained financial system. UNDER STRAIN Markets have been severely strained as bankers, companies and individual investors stampeded into cash and safe-haven assets, while selling profitable positions to raise money to cover losses in savaged equities. Such is the dislocation the Fed cut interest rates by 100 basis points on Sunday to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and promised to expand its balance sheet by at least $700 billion in coming weeks. Five of its peers also joined up to offer cheap U.S. dollar funding for financial institutions facing stress in credit markets. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been haranguing the Fed to ease policy, called the move ""terrific"" and ""very good news."" ""It  may be a shot in the arm for risk assets and help to address liquidity concerns...however, it also raises the question of whether the Fed has anything left in the tank should the spread of the virus not be contained,"" said Kerry Craig, global market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""We really need to see the fiscal side...to prevent a longer than needed economic slowdown."" The Fed's rate cut combined with the promise of more bond buying pushed U.S. 10-year Treasury yields down sharply to 0.68% , from 0.95% late on Friday. That pressured the U.S. dollar at first, though it regained some ground as the Asian session wore on. The dollar was last down 1% on the Japanese yen at 106.82, having fallen 1.7% earlier in the day. The euro was flat at $1.1112. The commodity-exposed Australian dollar fell 0.2% to $0.6171 while the New Zealand dollar slipped 0.4% to $0.6036. Oil prices fell on concerns about global demand. Brent crude was last off $1.01 at $32.84 per barrel while U.S. crude slipped 53 cents to $31.20 a barrel. Gold rallied 1.1% to $1,546.74.

221,Doctor Bill Gates Is Now “President of Planet Earth”,Dr. Keith Scott–Mumby,"A couple of days ago, I heard from Fort Russ News, that the US Surgeon General (equivalent of the British Chief Medical Officer) Jerome Adams is to officially dump the Bill Gates-CDC-Fauci nonsense predictions and start moving forward with… wait for it: FACTS! Real data, instead of propaganda.1

This will annoy (I hope) Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, who have made a media tour, threatening the public that businesses may not re-open for six months to a year, or until and unless governments purchase their conveniently patented, Big-Pharma vaccines.

Doctor (actually, college drop-out) Bill Gates is now President of Planet Earth, did you notice the switch. No election. He just is. Laying the down law and telling us what to do, from the heart of arrogance and the depth of ignorance, but bolstered by a degree of self-belief that only a psychotic would demonstrate.

Gates screwed up the computing world and saddled us all with Microsoft mush. Taxed everyone with a computer (in effect), to make himself obscene billions. Now he wants to do the same with health, politics and autonomy. Microsoft grabbed your rights, freedom and intellectual property. Now he wants you, a slave to his megalomania. He’s not a doctor. He doesn’t even have a first-aid certificate!

But there are sane voices out there too:

professor john Iaonnidis

Professor John Ioannidis is Professor of Medicine, of Health Research and Policy and of Biomedical Data Science, at Stanford University School of Medicine; and a Professor of Statistics at Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences; director of the Stanford Prevention Research Center; and co-director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS).

He is also the editor-in-chief of the European Journal of Clinical Investigation. He was chairman at the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Ioannina School of Medicine as well as adjunct professor at Tufts University School of Medicine.

In other words, this guy is no lightweight.

Ioannidis states baldly that we are getting a very distorted picture, because patients who have been tested up to now are mainly those with severe symptoms and bad outcomes.

The one situation where an entire, closed population was tested was the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its quarantine passengers. The case fatality rate there was 1.0%, but this was a largely elderly population, in which the death rate from Covid-19 is much higher.

Among normal, healthy people, the death rate is gradually falling to become about 0.1%, which is average for flu EVERY YEAR. We never locked down in the past!

There are deniers, of course, industry shills, who are paid to keep the fear-mongering going. They quote the distorted statistics for older people and try to pretend that the virus is the total cause of death, not the other 2, 3 or more pathologies which exist at the same time.

However, even some so-called mild or common-cold-type coronaviruses that have been known for decades can have case fatality rates as high as 8% when they infect elderly people in nursing homes.

In fact, as Ioannidis says:

“If we had not known about a new virus out there, and had not checked individuals with PCR tests, the number of total deaths due to “influenza-like illness” would not seem unusual this year. At most, we might have casually noted that flu this season seems to be a bit worse than average.”2

This wise interpretation is backed up by one of the only proper investigative studies, carried out in Santa Clara County, California, in which the authors estimated that the true infection fatality rate is somewhere in the range of 0.12% to 0.2%—far closer to seasonal influenza than to the original, case-based estimates.3

Michael T. Osterholm, a regents professor and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, is another voice of reason in the jungle of frenzy and fear:

Consider the effect of shutting down offices, schools, transportation systems, restaurants, hotels, stores, theaters, concert halls, sporting events and other venues indefinitely and leaving all of their workers unemployed and on the public dole. The likely result would be not just a depression but a complete economic breakdown, with countless permanently lost jobs, long before a vaccine is ready or natural immunity takes hold.

The best alternative will probably entail letting those at low risk for serious disease continue to work, keep business and manufacturing operating, and “run” society, while at the same time advising higher-risk individuals to protect themselves through physical distancing and ramping up our health-care capacity as aggressively as possible. With this battle plan, we could gradually build up immunity without destroying the financial structure on which our lives are based.4

Previously, the task force was working with predictive models, frequently criticized because of their tendency to exaggerate the possible effect of the virus on the United States. Models predicting the deaths of millions and hundreds of thousands in America appear to be overblown, as the real-time data is showing the death count much lower.

Adams said that the models usually took data from different cultures and places around the globe, but they were able to track more accurately what could happen in the United States based on real data gathered in places such as California and New York.

“We’re following this data every single day, and we’re giving that data to communities so that they can make informed and intelligent decisions about when and where to reopen,” he said.

A significant indicator for communities being allowed to reopen, Adams said, was actual testing data, not a predictive model.

“I feel confident that some places will start to reopen in May and June. Other places won’t; it will be piece by piece, bit by bit, but will be data-driven,” he said.

Real data? What’s he playing at? Oh, science, I guess, not propaganda!

I hope so…",1,
361,Lawyers risking their lives at police stations and courts due to lack of social distancing | UK | News | Express.co.uk,"MARCO GIANNANGELI, SUNDAY EXPRESS DEFENCE EDITOR","  The warning follows the death of solicitor Steve Knight, who contracted the virus during an interview with a client at a police station. Mr Knight, a former detective sergeant with the Metrpolitan Police who died on Thursday, his 70th birthday, began to show symptoms of Coronavirus six days after attending Folkestone police station in Kent. Though many solicitors have boycotted police stations Mr Knight, a freelance police station  representative, relied on police interviews for his income and felt obliged to carry on. Last night his heartbroken widow Jenny said: â€œSteve  was the most wonderful, caring and loving husband. He was also the proud father of Victoria and Richard â€œHe was the love of my life and I will miss him forever.â€ She described his anger at having been placed in that position. â€œHe was called to Folkestone Police Station to represent a client on 10th March,â€ she said. â€œWhen he got home he told me that if ever he was going to contract Coronavirus it would be after that visit,  as he had just been forced to spend a couple of hours in a small interview room opposite a translator who was clearly unwell.  â€œSix days later he began to develop symptoms. He became very ill but refused to go to hospital because he was convinced he wouldnâ€™t come out. When he was admitted, he was placed in ICU and was in a coma within two hours. It was the last time I saw him. â€œI hope and pray that police forces will learn from this, so that at least his death will not have been in vain.â€ Recent figures have shown that, despite a national lockdown, crime fell by only 28 percent in the four weeks leading up to April 12. Arrests of drug addicts, who have weakened limmunity to the virus, remain â€œrobustâ€ nationwide. Related offences  include theft, robbery and violent assault, which potentially spread the virus further. Under new government Covid-19 rules Crown Court trials have been suspended and the CPS is prosecuting only more serious offences. But work at Magistratesâ€™ court level continues. On Thursday it also emerged that the custody manager at Londonâ€™s Westminster magistratesâ€™ court had been rushed into intensive care after contracting the virus. Sources connected with the court said custody cells remained full on the following day and there still had been no deep clean, hand sanitisers, personal protective equipment or soap. The courtâ€™s diversion team, who identify those with mental health problems, have now boycotted the court.  Kent police immediately began to make changes. And a new protocol by the National Police Chiefs Council was launched two weeks ago in response to mounting concerns. It urged all police forces to enable solicitors to conduct â€œvirtualâ€ interviews with clients. But the initiative has met with mixed success. In the West Midlands, one solicitor told how in two separate occasions recently custody sergeants had interrupted phone interviews  to demand that solicitors attend in person. â€œThe officers in charge of cases are very understanding, but weâ€™ve had several examples where custody sergeants arenâ€™t complying with the guidelines and weâ€™re just not satisfied that our staff would be safe attending these police stations,â€ said Stephanie Brownlees, director with Eden Legal Services. â€œEven where PPE is provided, it is often removed. But the police response is â€“ if you donâ€™t want to come, other firms will. â€œWeâ€™re aware that some firms choose to send freelance agents like Mr Knight instead of risking their own staff. Our view is that, if itâ€™s isnâ€™t safe for us, it isnâ€™t safe for them either.â€ In the North East, Cleveland, Durham and North Yorkshire police forces are making an effort to comply, but custody sergeants â€œjust arenâ€™t getting the messageâ€ said Emma Williams, of Watson Woodhouse solicitors in Middlesbrough. â€œIâ€™ve been offered masks and hand sanitiser - but it very much depends on the police station,â€ she said. â€œWhen we tried to do Skype interviews recently both Durham and Peterlee police stations informed us theyâ€™d only make available rooms where recording equipment was always operating. Clearly, a solicitor cannot have a private consultation with a client under those circumstances. In Lincolnshire, police were still holding interviews in old, unmanned police stations not eqipped for social distancing or virtual conferences as recently as a fortnight ago, though this is changing, said Stuart Wild, a partner of Bird & Co solitons in Grantham. Hampshire Constabulary was accused of ignoring the guidelines altogether, with some solicitors  confiding that their concerns were met by accusations from  officers that they were â€œsnowflakesâ€. Yet the  force has issue more than 100 fixed penalty notices to people breaching social distancing rules. Last night Ian Kelcey, co-chair of the Law Society criminal law committee, said: â€œSolicitors are very anxious about  going into police stations  because we're dealing with coronavirus and frankly police stations don't have much in the way of PPE and arenâ€™t always the cleanest place to go. â€œBy far the worst force has been Hampshire who, solicitors tell us,  are insisting that they will not provide remote interviews in any of its stations.  â€œIt is the height of irresponsibility and hypocrisy for any police forces to be playing Russian Roulette with the health and safety of lawyers by trying to force them into confined spaces in police interview rooms when, at the same time, they are issuing fixed penalty notices to people who are not socially distancing in the open air.â€ Last night Hampshire Assistant Chief Constable Stuart Murray admitted: â€œAt this time, we do not have the video enabled capabilities in place in our custody blocks to host virtual interviews but we are working hard to explore what virtual options we have so that we can work safely within the guidance.â€ He added: â€œOur custody suites are designed in such a way that two metre social distancing is possible for those in the building, a thorough cleaning routine is in place, and custody sergeants have also been instructed that anyone who enters a custody block who wishes to have PPE should be given access to it.â€ Last night a spokesman for the NPCC said: â€œMany forces have introduced technology to facilitate live audio-visual communication as an alternative to defence solicitors being physically present and those that do not are very quickly developing and implementing measures to do so. â€œIn cases where this is still not possible, PPE is available in custody suites and police forces have been proactively writing to defence solicitor firms to reassure them of the enhanced health and safety measures that are in place.â€ Solicitor Steve Knight died on Thursday, his 70th birthday, after contracting Covid-19 at a police station.

139,Negligent “import” of refugees into Germany: most migrants are infected with coronavirus,Anonymous,"The German government is increasingly delivering the so-called refugees from Greek camps to Germany and believes that this is how the country fulfills its “humanitarian duty”. In fact, it jeopardizes public health – it is too likely that all of these migrants are infected with coronavirus.

Now in a camp on the Greek peninsula of Peloponnese, there are more than 150 refugees who were previously rescued in the Aegean. And everyone has a positive coronavirus test result. This was stated by the Greek Vice Minister of Civil Protection, Nikos Chardalias, according to media in Athens. Another refugee camp, which has about 470 migrants, was already quarantined the day before.

“We will do our best to limit the spread of the virus”, – said Athens’s government spokesman on Tuesday. Deputy Minister Chardalias hastened to emphasize in an interview for state television: “No need to panic”.

In recent weeks, two refugee camps north of Athens have been isolated. According to the Ministry of Migration, about 100,000 people live in Greek camps. All of them want to get to Central Europe. About 39,000 of them remain on islands in the east of the Aegean. Quarantine restrictions were in effect at all camps for several weeks.",1,
290,Japan to boost stimulus to $1.1 trillion as virus threatens deeper recession - Reuters,"Takaya Yamaguchi, Tetsushi Kajimoto","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan boosted its new economic stimulus package on Monday to a record $1.1 trillion to expand cash payouts to its citizens, as the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic threatens to push the worldâ€™s third-largest economy deeper into recession. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe formally decided the new stimulus less than two weeks after his cabinet approved an earlier plan to spend 108.2 trillion yen ($1 trillion), which had detailed payouts of 300,000 yen to households with sharp drops in income. Abe has caved into pressure from within his own ruling bloc to boost the help with a payment of 100,000 yen for every citizen, instead of 300,000 yen for a limited number of households, analysts say, casting doubt about his leadership amid falling support. The new amount triples the cost from what the government had originally planned to 12 trillion yen. â€œI understand the 100,000 yen payout scheme was decided with the aim of encouraging every citizen to help with each other to overcome this crisis as one,â€ Finance Minister Taro Aso said. â€œThe finance ministry will do the utmost to have this enacted quickly so that the payouts and other support will be delivered to the people as early as possible.â€ Expansion of the scheme may support private consumption that accounts for more than half of the economy, some analysts said, though many others believe most of the payouts would end up in savings rather than spending to shore up the economy. â€œRecipients of the payouts include the rich and the people whose incomes are not suffering, so savings will also rise,â€ said Ryutaro Kono, chef economist at BNP Paribas Securities. â€œEven considering more people will suffer economic pain this time than during the 2009 financial crisis, the proportion of the payouts that will be spent is estimated at about 40%. As such, it would push up GDP only by 0.3 percentage points.â€ The upsized package will total 117.1 trillion yen ($1.086 trillion), with fiscal measures making up less than half of it, the Ministry of Finance said. To help fund the stimulus spending, the government compiled a record supplementary budget worth 25.7 trillion yen for the fiscal year from April 1, to be funded entirely by additional bond issuance, the ministry said. It compared with an initial extra budget worth 16.8 trillion yen. Reuters was the first to report the stimulus budget and bond issuance plans ahead of the official announcement. While the government boosts fiscal stimulus, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has also joined other central banks to roll out stimulus to stave off the risk of a global recession. The BOJ eased monetary policy last month by pledging to boost risky asset purchases and create a new loan scheme to pump more money into firms hit by slumping sales. The central bank will discuss further steps to ease corporate funding strains at this monthâ€™s rate review as the impact hits profits. The government on the other hand will raise the market issuance of government bonds by 5.8 trillion yen to 152.8 trillion yen in the fiscal year to March 2021. The extra borrowing will add to the industrial worldâ€™s heaviest public debt burden, which is more than twice the size of Japanâ€™s $5 trillion economy. It is rare for the government to compile an extra budget at the start of a new fiscal year, and it is even rarer to revise a budget draft that has been approved by the cabinet after coordinating closely with the ruling coalition. Last week, the prime minister, who has been criticised by some over his handling of the pandemic, apologised for confusion over a plan to start distributing coronavirus relief payments next month. The government is expected to submit the extra budget to parliament early next week, with the aim of gaining approval by the â€œGolden Weekâ€ holidays early May. More than 200 people have died from the virus in Japan, which has reported more than 11,000 infections, of which more than a quarter are in Tokyo.

69,"COVID-19: Martial Law, Digital Currency, and World Government",Kurt Nimmo,"No chance, however. As I write this, Congress passed a pork-laden“stimulus” bill. 

If we can believe numbers put out by the CDC, as of Friday, March 27 there were 1,246 deaths in the US attributed to the virus. Compare this with the 1968 H3N2 “Hong Kong Flu.” It reportedly killed 100,000 people in the US and around a million around the world. 

At the time, the response was not to lock down the country and destroy the livelihood of millions of Americans and usher in the severe violations of the Constitution we are now witnessing.

Short of COVID-19 numbers shooting into the stratosphere in the long run, the death rate will be nowhere near those of the H3N2 pandemic. After the virus is put down by warm temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere, jobless and impoverished Americans will scratch their heads in wonderment at the overreaction by government. 

Back in 1968, the US economy was doing fairly well. It was the economic powerhouse of the world. The economy began the slow process of engineered deterioration after the so-called “Nixon shock” imposed wage and price freezes in response to Federal Reserve manufactured inflation and the direct international convertibility of the dollar to gold in 1971. 

10% inflation in the 1970s was “the result of the honest mistakes of a well-meaning central bank (sic),” according to the Fed.

The former Fed boss, Ben BerAnonymouske, said in 2002 “honest mistakes” were also responsible for the stock market crash in 1929 and the Great Depression that followed (see Jerry Mazza’s How the FED engineered the Great Depression; for historical comparison of the current economic trauma prior to COVID-19, see Doug Casey: Comparing the 1930s and Today). 

Is the current corporate propaganda media-generated hysteria over what appears thus far to be a normal influenza virus happenstance? 

I argue the pandemic was planned or conveniently exploited, if not beforehand then in its early stage as it swept China. I am convinced the virus was arranged or exploited to make an excuse for a coming and unavoidable Greater Depression, a historically unmatched depression as a direct result of the fraud, manipulation, and gambling debts of the fiAnonymouscial class. Blame for the pinpricks deflating absurdly enlarged and distorted asset bubbles horrendously crashing the economy will be laid at President Donald Trump’s door. Moreover, the crash and its enforced misery—only now beginning to gain fatal momentum—will be used by the ruling elite to demand several drastic “reforms,” beginning with a call for a centralized world government. This globalist scheme, long in the planning, will be rolled out “temporarily” to confront the virus. 

From The Guardian on March 27:

Gordon Brown has urged world leaders to create a temporary form of global government to tackle the twin medical and economic crises caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The former Labour prime minister, who was at the centre of the international efforts to tackle the impact of the near-meltdown of the banks in 2008, said there was a need for a taskforce involving world leaders, health experts and the heads of the international organisations that would have executive powers to coordinate the response.

Brown’s “executive power” will become permanent after the virus has subsided. It will be the foundation for a global government after the world economy finally falls off a cliff—possibly weeks or months away—and the desperate masses begin rioting in the streets over food shortages and the inevitable institution of martial law (or something similar without the namesake in an end-run around the Constitution, which does not explicitly grant emergency powers to a president). 

Prior to Gordon Brown’s demand, bankers and establishment economists began a heightened call for “a digital alternative to paper money” to stop the spread of the virus and “helping improve fiAnonymouscial inclusion by addressing the needs of millions of Americans that remain unbanked, according to the FDIC.” 

In January, the elite at Davos was way ahead of the curve on the effort to dispose of paper money and replace it with a digital fiAnonymouscial and societal control mechanism. 

“Users of the U.S. dollar are ‘underserved by an analogue currency in a digital world,’ Christopher Giancarlo, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), said during an event in Davos,” CNBC reported. 

The promise of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is that it could make cross-border movement of money easier and improve traceability to fight corruption or money laundering, according to Henri Arslanian, global crypto leader at PwC.

It would also make tracking and surveilling citizens far easier and more efficient. “There are two kinds of economic surveillance to take note of. One is surveillance by companies, the other is by the state,” writes Melissa Twigg. 

“It’s the companies that want to get data on you,” says [fiAnonymouscial analyst Tom Nicholls]. “But they form the pool of data that then a state would be able to access.” It may sound very Black Mirror, but it’s already happening in China, where mass fiAnonymouscial data from Alipay is helping to craft the country’s social-credit system, which will reward and punish citizens based on economic behaviour.

There appears to be no end to the manufacture of state and media-generated hysteria.

ABC News notes that a “Department of Homeland Security memo sent to law enforcement officials around the country warns that violent extremists could seek to take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic by carrying out attacks against the U.S… The memo, which was circulated on Monday, comes after assurances from FBI Director Chris Wray in a video message that agents would be even more vigilant in monitoring threats to the U.S. as the virus spreads.” 

Last August the FBI “for the first time has identified fringe conspiracy theories as a domestic terrorist threat,” according to a memo circulated at the FBI’s Phoenix office. 

“The FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts,” the document states. It also goes on to say the FBI believes conspiracy theory-driven extremists are likely to increase during the 2020 presidential election cycle.

For those who pay attention, there is ample evidence the FBI arranges terrorist plots and has done so at least since the agency ran its unconstitutional COINTELPRO takedown of numerous political opponents beginning in the 1950s. 

Both the FBI and DHS may begin categorizing those of us who differ with the state and its media on the origin and impact of the coronavirus as “domestic extremists” bent on destroying the nation. 

The real destroyers and psychopathic misanthropes, however, are in high places. They are cynically and criminally exploiting the coronavirus—so far no more dangerous than seasonal flu—to shove their one-world agenda down our throats as easily frightened Americans run around like Chicken Little, begging the state to take care of us before the sky falls.

504,Wuhan officials have revised the city's coronavirus death toll up by 50%  - CNN,"James Griffiths and Steven Jiang, CNN","(CNN) China has revised its official death toll from the novel coronavirus, raising the number of fatalities attributed to the pandemic by more then a third. Officials in Wuhan, where the virus was first reported late last year, on Friday added 1,290 coronavirus deaths to the city's toll. They also added 325 confirmed cases to the city tally. The total number of cases recorded in the city now stands at 50,333, with 3,869 deaths. The previous reported death toll for Wuhan was 2,579 -- so the revised figure marks a 50% increase in the number of deaths in the city from coronavirus. As of April 17, China's National Health Commission had reported 3,342 deaths nationally , before the revised Wuhan figures were published. Officials explained that the deaths had initially gone uncounted because in the early stages of the pandemic some people died at home, overwhelmed medics were focused on treating cases rather than reporting deaths and a delay in collecting figures from various government and private organizations. Read More They added that the figures had been revised to show ""accountability to history, to the people and the victims,"" as well as to ensure ""open and transparent disclosure of information and data accuracy."" This isn't the first time health authorities in China have changed numbers related to the pandemic. The way cases were counted was changed three times in January and February , leading to widespread confusion over the extent of the crisis in China. Experts have also previously raised the alarm over China's approach to measuring asymptomatic cases. Some patients who tested positive for the virus but did not show symptoms were not included in official tallies, making comparing China's figures to the rest of the world difficult.",0,
162,"Western Media Talks Up Big Pharma's Search For Coronavirus Vaccine While Ignoring Use Of High Does Vitamin C To Save Lives In China
",Dr. Leon Tressell,"Clinical trials using high dose vitamin C therapy in China ignored by Western media
New York hospitals now using vitamin C therapy to treat coronavirus patients
Not a day passes without some hyped up media story of how big-pharma is racing to the rescue of humanity with its search for a coronavirus vaccine. There are over 40 companies now searching for a vaccine. Collectively they are spending huge sums of money supported by lavish amounts of tax payer cash. Estimates of how soon a vaccine can be produced vary wildly but most estimates agree that it is unlikely to happen this year. It goes without saying that the first to market with a usable vaccine stands to make billions of dollars.

The mainstream media, scientific and political establishments are completely under the spell of big pharma. Governments reassure the public that they’re doing everything in their power to protect them with a variety of measures. These range from mass lock downs and trillion dollar bailouts for big business to limited amounts of helicopter money for the citizens of wealthier countries.

Regardless of where you live if you have to go to hospital with symptoms of the coronavirus the key question facing you is: will you be able to leave walking out front door or will you end up being wheeled out the basement back door?

The mainstream media in cahoots with governments and the medical establishment are suppressing any news regarding the use of a cheap, safe and easy to produce treatment for coronavirus patients. Maybe its because this treatment is being used in Chinese hospitals to save lives. Let’s face it there has been no let up in Cold War 2.0 during the current pandemic.

Dr. Andrew W. Saul, Editor in chief of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, sums up the Western big pharma approach nicely when he says:

 

“Medical orthodoxy obsessively focuses on searching for a vaccine and/or drug for coronavirus COVID-19). While they are looking for what would be fabulously profitable approaches, we have with vitamin C an existing, plausible, clinically demonstrated method to treat what coronavirus patients die from: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or pneumonia.”

On 17 March a group of Chinese physicians held a video conference to discuss the use of high dose intravenous vitamin C for patients with moderate to severe cases of corona virus. The keynote speaker at this meeting was Dr. Enqian Mao, chief of the emergency medicine Department of Ruiijin hospital in Shanghai.

Dr Mao is also a senior member of the expert team at the Shanghai Public health Centre, where all coronavirus patients have been treated from the Shanghai area. Dr Mao was also a co-author of the medical protocol for the treatment of coronavirus that has been adopted by the Shanghai Medical Association and the government of Shanghai. This medical protocol also advocates the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe cases of the coronavirus.

Over the last decade Dr Mao has been using high-dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to treat patients with a variety of acute medical conditions ranging from pancreatitis and sepsis to surgical wound healing. When the coronavirus epidemic first broke out he and several other colleagues thought that high-dose intravenous C could be a potential treatment for patients presenting with the coronavirus. Their recommendation for the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C as a treatment was adopted by the Shanghai expert team.

Dr. Richard Cheng, an American-Chinese doctor currently based in Shanghai has given a report of this meeting. He notes that:

“Dr. Mao stated that his group treated ~50 cases of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 infection with high dose IVC. The IVC dosing was in the range of 10,000 mg – 20,000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10,000 mg for moderate cases and 20,000 for more severe cases, determined by pulmonary status (mostly the oxygenation index) and coagulation status. All patients who received IVC improved and there was no mortality. Compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay about 3-5 days shorter than the overall patients. Dr. Mao discussed one severe case in particular who was deteriorating rapidly. He gave a bolus of 50,000 mg IVC over a period of 4 hours. The patient’s pulmonary (oxygenation index) status stabilized and improved as the critical care team watched in real time. There were no side effects reported from any of the cases treated with high dose IVC. ”

Dr Cheng also reported that he had a separate meeting with Dr. Sheng Wang, Professor of critical medicine of Shanghai’s 10th Hospital, Tongji University College of medicine. At this meeting Professor Weng said that there were several important lessons to be learned from Shanghai’s experience treating patients with the coronavirus. The most important lesson was:

“Early and high-dose IVC is quite helpful in helping Covid-19 patients. The data is still being finalized and the formal papers will be submitted for publication as soon as they are complete.”

Professor Wang also stated that coronavirus patients displayed a high rate of hyper-coagulability, i.e. an abnormally increased tendency toward blood clotting, which is best treated with heparin.

He also stated that it was vitally important for front line medical professionals to, ‘wear protective clothing at the earliest opportunity for intubation and other emergency rescue measures.’ The American health authorities should take notice of this considering that pictures of nurses in New York wearing black plastic refuse sacks have been appearing on social media.

Richard Chang has also noted that Professors Mao and Weng have stated that high-dose intravenous vitamin C is being used as a treatment for coronavirus patients in other hospitals around China.

Not surprisingly, reports of this cheap, safe treatment, that has been pioneered in China, have been being completely ignored by Western governments and the medical establishments that are beholden to the big pharma approach to the current pandemic.

Thankfully, there are doctors in the West who are not blinded by the close minded approach pursued by their governments and so called medical experts. Apparently, doctors at several hospitals in New York, which is the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic in America, have started to use the pioneering treatments coming out of China.

Dr. Andrew G. Weber, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, has said that coronavirus patients admitted to intensive care immediately receive 1,500 mg of intravenous vitamin C. This dosage is then repeated 3-4 times a day.

According to Dr. Weber this treatment regime is based upon the experimental use of high-dose vitamin C in Shanghai’s hospitals. He told the New York Post:

“The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C. It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.”

Apparently, high-dose intravenous vitamin C is been used in hospitals across New York. Sadly, its use appears to be patchy and is dependent upon the whims of individual doctors rather than being part of any systematic medical protocol.

As the global death toll soars higher we can only hope that more and more doctors will follow in the footsteps of their Chinese colleagues and have the courage to use a safe and cheap treatment that is totally at odds with the big pharma approach currently followed by the World Health Organisation and most governments. The current approach used by many Western Governments has been slow, clumsy and ill informed putting the interests of big business above saving the lives of ordinary people.

335,"Britain's dealmaking drops a third on coronavirus, recession fears - Reuters",Pamela Barbaglia,"LONDON (Reuters) - The volume of merger and acquisition (M&A) deals involving companies based in Britain has dropped 31% so far this year to a six-year low, according to Refinitiv data, amid the coronavirus outbreak and fears of a recession. The spread of the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19, has sent financial markets into a tailspin, fuelling fears of severe economic damage and forcing central banks to take some of the biggest emergency stimulus measures since the financial crisis. In Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered schools to shut down and people to work from home, four mega deals have skewed the picture, driving up the value of dealmaking while the volume has dropped significantly. On March 9, insurance broker Aon (AON.N) agreed to buy rival Willis Towers Watson (WLTW.O) in a $30 billion all-stock deal which is set to create a global powerhouse. In February, a consortium involving buyout funds Cinven and Advent clinched a deal to take control of Thyssenkruppâ€™s (TKAG.DE) elevators business for 17.2 billion euros ($18.5 billion), while Blackstone (BX.N) bought UK student accommodation company iQ for 4.66 billion pounds. And British retailer Tesco (TSCO.L) agreed to offload its Thai and Malaysian businesses for an enterprise value of $10.6 billion on March 9. These deals have played a key role in doubling the value of UK dealmaking to 84.3 billion pounds so far in 2020, compared with the same period last year. But the pace of dealmaking has almost come to a halt. In March, only 131 deals involving a UK-based company have been announced, compared with 447 in March 2019. The overall volume since the start of the year has also dropped to 749 from 1,090 in 2019, the lowest since 2014. The value of deals involving UK-based companies buying targets overseas is down 14%, totalling 7.7 billion pounds so far in 2020 and a seven-year low. This year, the vast majority of deals have seen British companies being sold to foreign rivals or merged with domestic players, with the value of inbound M&A totalling 13.7 billion pounds so far, up 8% on the same time last year. The value of domestic dealmaking has more than tripled with 31.4 billion pounds worth of deals in 2020, but Aonâ€™s 22.9 billion pound swoop on Willis Towers Watson accounted for 81% of that, as both firms are headquartered in London. Investment banking fees generated in Britain have totalled 822.4 million pound so far in 2020, 12% less than at the same time last year and the lowest year-to-date total since 2013. After a strong start to the year with 405.6 million pounds generated in January, fees subsequently declined to just 131.3 million pounds in March.

Top tips and advice from the NHS | Express.co.uk,Katie Sewell," Coronavirus cases are on the rise across the world with more than 100,000 cases confirmed. You may need to self-isolate if you have been in contact with someone confirmed to have the illness, or if you have travelled to an area affected by coronavirus. Health services are trying to trace people who have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus in the UK. If you need to self-isolate, you must avoid contact with people and stay indoors for 14 days. This is necessary even if you do not have symptoms. If you think you might have coronavirus, have been in contact with someone with it or have travelled from an affected area, the NHS recommends you do not go to your GP or hospital, and instead call 111 or use the NHS 111 online service. READ MORE: Virologist tells Nick Ferrari steps she is taking to avoid coronavirus   According to Public Health England, self-isolation means staying at home for 14 days. During this time, you should not go to work and should stay away from public places and transport. During this time you should keep away from other people in your home, and not receive any visitors. The NHS has issued guidance on its website about the doâ€™s and donâ€™ts of self-isolating.  The NHS advice is as follows: stay at home separate yourself from other people â€“ for example, try not to be in the same room as other people at the same time only allow people who live with you to stay stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened ask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you, such as getting groceries, medicines or other shopping DON'T MISS: Lefty doctor red-faced on BBC QT after admitting he canâ€™t blame Tories [VIDEO]Coronavirus horror: Patients funerals could be streamed online [INSIGHT]Coronavirus UK cases: How to track latest COVID-19 numbers in the UK [MAP] make sure you tell delivery drivers to leave items outside for collection if you order online clean toilets and bathrooms regularly think about a bathroom rota if a separate bathroom is not available, with the isolated person using the facilities last, before thoroughly cleaning the bathroom themselves use separate towels from anyone else in the household wash crockery and utensils thoroughly with soap and water; dishwashers may be used to clean crockery and cutlery stay away from your pets â€“ if unavoidable, wash your hands before and after contact  do not invite visitors to your home or allow visitors to enter do not go to work, school or public areas do not use public transport like buses, trains, tubes or taxis do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding or other items with other people in your home See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",0,
229,Breaking News - Vaccine Update!,Anonymous,"Government funding was pulled from Gates Foundation, WHO and CDC (Centre for Disease Control). U.S. Government lost a LANDMARK VACCINE LAWSUIT!

Vaccine injury lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Del Bigtree, producer of the suppressed vaccine documentary, ‘VAXXED’ and the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) are credited with this victory. They demanded the relevant government documents proving that all federally approved vaccines had been tested for quality over the past 32 years — and there were NONE! Zero, zilch, nada!

Here are the huge legal and practical implications in this victory for the American people: This means that the US Department of Health and Human Services and all vaccine makers have been deceiving the American people for over 30 years about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines; this may ultimately mean that the continuing existence — at least in their current form — of five US “healthcare” agencies is now in doubt: the CDC, the FDA, the IOM, the NIH and the “Health” part of DHHS itself!

This may also threaten the existence of state medical boards and exclusive medical guilds like the AMA. This means that vaccine makers have been fraudulently exempt from what all other pharmaceutical drug makers have been forced to do concerning biannual recertification for quality and effectiveness — meaning that their vaccines have never been tested for quality and have had no proven safety or effectiveness for over 30 years. This case can now be legally cited by all parents fraudulently mandated by any government/ organizational regulation/ requirements that they must vaccinate their children for school or any other activity to stop the forced vaccination of their children. This case can now be legally cited by all employees being mandated by their employers to be vaccinated in order to retain their jobs. This case can now be legally cited by all those who seek compensation for vaccine injury.

The future of allopathic medicine in its current form is now in doubt, and the global pharmaceutical cartel, since almost all of the drugs allopathic practitioners prescribe come from pharmaceutical corporations that have also committed vaccine fraud and injury. LIABILITY: All government officials who have passed laws legalizing vaccine fraud at the state, national, or international level, or otherwise aided and abetted this vaccine fraud can now be charged with vaccine fraud, criminal malfeasance and in some cases, war crimes under the Nuremberg Code.

As of May 1, the CDC website states that 37,308 people died from the Wuhan coronavirus, which includes confirmed and presumed deaths from the pathogen. The data also shows that the coronavirus pandemic peaked in the U.S. the week of April 11. Additionally, the number of coronavirus deaths have been decreasing since April 25, with about 93% of all coronavirus deaths happening to individuals over 55 years old. As Newsmax journalist John Cardillo noted, the data reported on by the media and Worldometer is a “scam” for likely attributing other causes of death to inflate coronavirus fatalities.

419,Nearly 3 million borrowers have been granted coronavirus mortgage aid,Diana Olick@in/dianaolick@DianaOlickCNBC@DianaOlick,"More than 2.9 million homeowners have taken advantage of a program designed to provide relief to holders of government-backed mortgages, part of the coronavirus CARES Act relief package. This represents 5.5% of all active mortgages, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data and analytics company that is now tracking the growing numbers daily. The program allows borrowers to delay their monthly payments for a year. Those payments are then tacked on to the end of the loan, or paid back over time in a mortgage modification. Borrowers must tell their mortgage servicers that they have had financial hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic, but they do not have to provide any proof. The 2.9 million loans in forbearance as of Thursday account for $651 billion in unpaid principal and include 4.9% of all government-sponsored enterprise loans (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) and 7.6% of all FHA/VA loans. ""In these times, it is essential to both our industry and for the benefit of the entire U.S. economy to have a clear understanding of the magnitude of the mortgage forbearance situation,"" said Black Knight CEO Anthony Jabbour. Even if borrowers don't make their monthly payments, those who collect the payments still have to advance the principal and interest amounts each month to bondholders. At the current level of forbearance, mortgage servicers would need to advance $2.3 billion per month to holders of government-backed mortgage securities on Covid-19-related forbearances. Another $1.1 billion in funds will be lost each month by those with portfolio-held or privately securitized mortgages (nearly 5% of these loans are in forbearance, as well). While Ginnie Mae, which backs FHA/VA loans, has set up a relief fund to help its servicers, there is nothing currently available for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA Director Mark Calabria, the regulator of the two, has held steadfast against setting a relief fund up, claiming it is not necessary. The entire mortgage industry has been fighting that hard, sending letters to the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, which would have to set up such a facility. ""It's frankly frustrating and ridiculous that we do not have a solution in place,"" said Jay Bray, CEO of Mr. Cooper, the nation's largest mortgage servicer, who consulted with the Trump administration to set up the bailout. ""When we were working on the Act, we had liquidity in it, and it did not make it into the Act. We were told it would be handled through the administration, and it's a real problem."" Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking for a bailout fund. Late this week, Democrats Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, and Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, sent another plea to Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, saying: ""The government must be prepared to respond quickly to prevent a liquidity shortfall in the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets, and to ensure that consumers are equitably served by that response. Any liquidity provided must be used to stabilize the market at a time when many families may fall behind on payments and facilitate relief to individual homeowners and renters throughout the market through forbearance, loss mitigation, and protection from displacement, rather than immediate defaults and evictions."" Calabria and Mnuchin did not respond to requests from CNBC for comment.",0,

However, it has been confirmed by anonymous sources that a league shutdown has been in the making for months and that they were simply looking for a good excuse to shut it all down. The players, led by Washington Generals All-Star Power Forward Art Tubolls, held a secret vote prior to the beginning of the season to suspend the league for any credible reason until President Donald Trump resigns from office or is voted out. Since much of the league is made up of Hollywood actor and musician wannabes, these millionaire crybabies overwhelming voted to approve the measure. Tubolls said “Our league is the most popular league in the world and we have a lot of teams in the swing states.

218,Facts Vs. Fake. A Worldwide Lockdown of Everything,Peter Koenig,"A complementary phrase developed in the last years is “fake news” — people who are saying well-founded truths, are being accused of spreading “false news” – and that by the very media that spread the real false news and lies in the first place. A dystopian world indeed, and most of the public doesn’t capture it.

Another denigrating term that has it lately into the vocabulary of the mainstream, “populist”. It refers to people or ideas from the left, the middle or the right – as soon as they don’t stick to the going narrative. By Webster’s definition, a populist is someone who represents the people’s views, a majority view, actually, it’s a very democratic term, because a true leader should represent the people’s views. But media manipulation has made of “populism” something of “lesser intellect” – and, of course, nobody wants to be of “lesser intellect”, hence, it’s become a derogatory term. That’s how the media and psychologically worked propaganda can alter what people would call “my common sense”.

The fear factor is always a crucial element in dividing people, and in corralling them into chambers of fear – which allows anything outside to happen – building up armament, faking an arms race – when there was none. The Soviet Union came out of WWII – where they lost between 25 and 30 million people to save Europe and the world from fascism.

But western history books have it, that it was the United States and her European allies, who foremost defeated Hitler. This false news is continuingly being propagated, last by the recent WWII Victory Celebration on 9 May 2020 – without any consideration of the key role of the Soviet Union – today’s Russia – in defeating the Hitler Nazis.

After this enormous sacrifice, the Soviet Union had no intention nor the resources to build up an army to defeat the west – as was being propagated by the US and then being aped by Europe, hence justifying 40 years of a Cold War, based on FEAR. The Cold War destroyed the natural relationship (trade, diplomatic, cultural) between Europe and today’s Russia.

Today, however, anybody who dares to remind the western media, politicians and friends of the real conqueror of Hitler, namely the Soviet Union – is a “conspiracy theorist” – or someone who spreads “false news”.

The Corona Crisis

The latest example of conspiracy galore, is the corona crisis. What is playing out in front of our eyes, a worldwide lockdown of everything, followed almost by every government of this globe with similar severity, quarantine, confinement at home for almost everyone under the “pretext” of protecting you – the people – from an invisible enemy – a corona virus. And every government KNOWS it is a disaster for the national and world economy – it is social suicide. Yet they go along – with the orders of whom?

As most of us who look for our own sources of information, outside the mainstream dominated, government dictated or supported lies, data collection and statistics on COVID infections, as well as death rates, are vastly inflated and willingly falsified, to increase the fear factor and prolong the all destructive lockdown. See this. This horrendous cheat is not just actively practiced in the US, but also in Europe. A point in case is Italy, see this.

Another case in point is Switzerland. The official Swiss Federal Office of Statistics (BAS, for German “Bundesamt für Statistik”), keeps records of all deaths in the country per week. In the first 18 weeks of 2020 (ending 3 May 2020), there were actually less deaths reported that in the first 18 weeks of 2015 – 25,400 (2020) vs. 26,596 (2015). How is that possible if the official death corona-death toll in Switzerland is 1,642, as of 24 May 2020. In other words, pretty much the same number of people die every year with or without corona. See this.

Since Switzerland has the 8th highest Covid death-rate in Europe, similar total death figures may most likely be found in other European countries and the US, i.e. virtually unchanged in the first 18 weeks of 2019 and 2020.

Unless solid proof is presented, like by the Italian Member of Parliament and a number of medical doctors, virologists and microbiologists from Italy and other European countries, as well as the US, anybody who refers to the fakeness and unreliability of the statistic is called a conspiracy theorist — a liar. And in some countries people who tell the truth are even liable to fines and legal pursuit. These threats and conspiracy accusations should shut us up. But they don’t and won’t. We want the truth to come out and be known to the entire world.

The World Economic Crisis

We already now realize the damage of unheard proportions. In the first four months of this so-called, WHO-denominated pandemic, we see a global disaster of proportions far exceeding those of 1929-33 and 2008-09. Never in recorded human history has so much misery been created.

Bankruptcies abound, the stock market plunged so far by more than 30% (with some ups and down – called “quick profit taking” by the rich and powerful on the back of the small investors). However, US billionaires increased their wealth during the the first 4 months in 2020 by US$ 406 billion, according to CNBC of 1 May 2020.

The universal Covid-lockdown has also caused a meltdown of productive assets, which now become easy prey to be bought by large corporations – unemployment soaring to heights never experienced before by modern humanity, currently at 40 million Americans out of a job. This does not account for those having given up looking for a job or claiming unemployment.

According to Fox Business News, up to 40% may never get back to work. The FED predicts unemployment may reach 50% by the end of the year (in the worst 1929 recession period unemployment attained 25%). These are only US statistics. The situation in more chaotic Europe may be even worse.

The International Labor Office (ILO) announced that within months worldwide unemployment may hit 1.6 billion people, half the globes work force. Many of these people, especially in the Global South have already been at the verge of poverty or under the poverty line, living from day to day, with no savings. Now they are condemned to begging – and many, maybe hundreds of millions, to die from famine, according to the World Food Program (WFP). Many if not most of them have no access to health services, no shelter, or any other form of social safety nets, because the COVID-caused economic collapse has wiped out even flimsy social safety structures poor countries may have set up.

Misery no end. And this is only the tiny tip of the iceberg. The worst is still to come – when in a few weeks or months a clearer picture of what industries will live or die will emerge – and more people will be relegated to economic paupers.

The Real Conspiracy

Taking a few steps back – it is clear, it is no coincidence that the entire world is stricken by the same virus and virtually at the same time. That does not happen naturally – but can happen, as it did, when the virus is artificially implanted in every country – and that at the same time. So, there is a diabolical plan behind this so-called corona-crisis which does not even have to be a crisis, if we look at real disease and death rates – not the inflated, fear-inspiring ones (see above, cases Italy and Switzerland).

Bill Gates and the Depopulation Agenda. Robert F. Kennedy Junior Calls for an Investigation
So, who is behind this all? – Well, without naming names and leaving that guessing up to you, there are several reports and events that have “predicted” such a pandemic. One of the most prominent ones, is the 2010 Rockefeller report – that described in surprising detail what is happening now, and calls it the “Lock Step” scenario. According to the report it should get worse and the current pandemic might be followed by a stronger wave later this year or in 2021. Strangely, the IMF’s economic projections for a “post-Covid economy, foresees 3 scenarios, two of which consider another outbreak in the second half of 2020, or in 2021.

Event 201 on 18 October 2019 in NYC, simulating among other atrocities a corona pandemic that would leave 65 million dead within 18 months (see this). This was the final stroke before the planned outbreak. Let’s just say that the evil masterminds behind this monstrous crisis are a few very rich, power-thirsty psychopaths and their families and cronies. They are planning a One World Government, also called the New World Order, or the One World Order – that has been under preparation since the latter part of the last century. It requires total control over the population and a sizable population reduction.



That’s where the eugenics come in. Many of the Rockefeller club, the “Bilderberg Society” members have been advocating population reduction for decades, including Bill Gates. He even bragged about it when in a 2010 TED talk in Southern California, “Innovating to Zero”, he said, “when we do a real god job vaccinating, we may reduce world population by 10% to 15%.” (see this). He wants to eliminate poverty, literally.

However, talking about it, and connecting the dots of what we are living today – is being labeled as Conspiracy Theory.

Why are Bill Gates’ new corona vaccines possibly killer vaccines? – Here is how it works. The Gates Foundation first created the pharmaceutical company “Moderna” in Seattle, Washington State, not far from his Microsoft empire, basically to produce tailor-made vaccines for the Gates Foundation. Then the foundation gave US$ 20 million to Moderna for the development of a COVID vaccine. A few days ago, Moncef  Slaoas resigned from Moderna’s Board to become White House Director of Operation Warp Speed, a plan to fast-track a COVID vaccine. Nobody seems to bother about the flagrant conflict of interest – let alone the health risk that poses. See Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the subject.

But it gets even better. The Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), a little-known agency that is hardly in the news, had, according to Whitney Webb (Last American Vagabond) knowledge of the pandemic outbreak at least since last November, possibly earlier.

This means that President Trump knew about it, but didn’t do anything about it, rather let it happen. His blaming China today for mishandling the corona crisis is a sheer lie and a propaganda bluff to denigrate China’s reputation and her rising economy and solid currency, the yuan – which may soon take over from the dollar as a key world reserve currency.

DARPA is also financially supported by the Bill Gates Foundation. They have been working on new vaccine technologies for several years. The COVID-19 outbreak brought this research work to prominence. DARPA is closely collaborating with Bill Gates in applying this new technology to the vaccine, Bill Gates wants to develop and impose on the world population.

According to Whitney Webb, DARPA and its partners agencies are planning to

“produce DNA and RNA vaccines, classes of vaccine that has never been approved for human use in the U.S. and involve injecting foreign genetic material into the human body. Notably, it is this very class of vaccine, now being produced by DARPA-partnered companies, that billionaire and global health “philanthropist” Bill Gates recently asserted has him “most excited”, relative to other Covid-19 vaccine candidates.”.

This is not conspiracy theory; this is real conspiracy. This sounds more like the Third Reich’s medical trials. The perpetrators were condemned at Nuremberg. In our dystopian world, nobody will be punished, even if thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands will be affected by the Gates WHO-supported rush with an untested vaccine. Though, it would match the eugenics agenda.

The so called (by WHO) COVID-19 “is the biggest scam ever perpetrated on the human race.” It is a multi-generational lie that has become a ‘false normal’, says Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, founder of the Tenpenny Integrative Medical Center. And as a piece of reference enhancing her reputation, she has 20 years of vaccine research experience and her articles are translated in 12 languages.She also appears frequently on radio and TV to educate parents.

“By putting vaccines into our bodies, we are inserting foreign matter, toxins, into our cells, like mercury and aluminum.” In legal terms vaccines are “unavoidably unsafe”. Through pharma lobbying, in 1986 Congress has passed the National Childhood Vaccine Children Act, a law whereby pharmaceutical companies cannot be sued for any damage their vaccines cause, including death. The United States Supreme Court Rules in favor of protecting vaccine makers from State Law Suits (5 May 2020).

Vaccines have enormous side effects, especially in small children, causing various lasting diseases, like peanut allergies, asthma, eczema and – yes – autism.

Particularly harmful vaccines are western-made MMR (measles), polio and DTP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough). Russian made vaccines have different compositions and have helped prevent millions from polio and other debilitating, crippling or killing diseases. Since 2002, when revenues from vaccines for US pharma companies amounted to about US$ 8 billion, revenues and profits have skyrocketed to more than 60 billion per year by 2020. Every new vaccine is worth about a billion dollars. Learn more here.

Anybody who speaks out against vaccination, irrespective of the evidence given, is labeled a conspiracy theorist by the media, and often by the pharma-coopted medical society.

People start understanding that Bill Gates and his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) call the shots on public health around the world, especially on vaccination – and now on vaccination against the corona virus. The sinister new vaccines to be developed by Bill Gates in tandem with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), one of 27 agencies of the National Institute of Health (NIH), andsupported by CDC and WHO – and in cooperation with DARPA – are described above. All Gates promoted vaccines are made by western pharma-corporations.

You should know, that the Bill Gates Foundation also generously funds NIAID, NIH and CDC. Both CDC and NIH own several hundred if not thousands of vaccine patents. So, they have a vested interest in promoting vaccination, no matter how much harm they cause to the population.

But this cannot be questioned, let alone criticized – else you will be denigrated as a conspiracy theorist.In fact, western Governments hire psychologists, sociologist and medical doctors to give interviews and talk to the media, on conspiracy theories – in a last-ditch effort to dissuade people from thinking and from believing the truth, if it is presented by non-mainstream media, or simply if it doesn’t correspond to the going political narrative. And many still fall for the lie, but ever more people are becoming suspicious and stick to their own investigated information – and demonstrate and protest, often with civil disobedience, against harsh government measure of police -and often military crackdowns.

They call out against Bill Gates and WHO, a corrupted organization that receives half to three quarters of its annual budget from private donors, mostly the pharma industry, Bill Gates, but also telecom-industries (that’s why WHO has been silent on the potentially nefarious effects of 5G). Bill Gates is the biggest single donor of WHO. Conflict of interest is never discussed in the media. Those who know the truth and don’t hesitate calling it out, are silenced by being called conspirators, liars by the media and – of course, by much of the medical community. In fact, Bill Gates literally calls the shots on matters of public health that affects the entire world.

People – be aware!

Also speaking out against vaccines and the lab produced viruses from which eventually vaccines are derived, is Dr. Judy Mikovits, a long-time NIAID micro-biologist, who has been severely punished by Dr. Fauci for defending her research results which Fauci wanted to hide. Her book, “Plague of Corruption” is currently Amazon’s number one Bestseller. That in itself tells a story of a public awakening.

Referring to her and her numerous interviews, peer-reviewed scientific articles and her book, is called a conspiracy, because even her own outspokenness is called conspiracy  – all in an effort to shut up critics of the current system, of the current new-normal that will soon require universal vaccination (Bill Gates with a sly smile wants to vaccinate 7 billion people in the next ten years). Will it be compulsory? Against most countries Constitutional and Democratic Rights? We don’t know. Sevenbillion is a slight exaggeration, because Russia and China will certainly not vaccinate their people with vaccines produced under Bill Gates funding and supervision.

But even if it is not compulsory, there may be so many “legal” hindrances put in place by western governments that most people eventually will roll over and accept the possibly killer vaccine that Bill Gates and his association of pharmaceuticals (GAVI) supported by WHO, will impose on humanity.

For example, you may not be able to receive or renew your driver’s license, going to concerts, to the movies, to sports events, to fly – and so on. That’s all been talked about and is part of the 2010 Rockefeller Report’s ”Lock Step” scenario , in which we are currently hopelessly navigating – under lockdown and with social distancing’ – so nobody can get together and possibly organize a plot against these draconian inhuman measures.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., JFK’s, nephew, founder of “Children’s Health Defense” an NGO advocacy organization has this to say:

“Bill Gates is the world’s largest vaccine producer and the single largest donor to WHO and the CDC Foundation. Those agencies are now marketing-arms for his vaccine empire.

In January 2019, Gates had WHO declare “vaccine hesitancy” the top “global health threat” (with Ebola, cancer, war, and drug-resistant pathogens), signaling a worldwide Pharma Gold Rush to mandate vaccines to all people.

Acting on behalf of Big Pharma and the Gates Foundation was Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s Political Action Committee (PAC). In February 2019, Schiff wrote to Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Pinterest, demanding they censor “vaccine misinformation, “a term meaning all skepticism toward government and industry pronouncements about vaccine safety or efficacy––whether true or not. – “Vaccines are both effective and safe,” Schiff wrote.

“There is no evidence to suggest that vaccines cause life-threatening or disabling disease.”

This was misinformation. A year earlier, Schiff pushed a bill to hike the Vaccine Court admin budget to $11,200,000 to reduce vaccine injury backlogs. The court had already paid out $4 billion for vaccine deaths and disabilities.

Facebook and Pinterest said that they will rely on Gates’s WHO and CDC to say which on-line statements are “misinformation or hoaxes.” Facebook and Google hired “FactChecker” (Politifact) to censor vaccine misinformation. The Gates Foundation is “FactChecker’s” largest funder. In his article, “Fact Checker, a Propaganda Device,” investigative journalist Jeremy Hammond concludes, “Facebook is guilty of misinforming its users about vaccine safety…

They have no problem with lies about vaccine safety and effectiveness, as long as it’s intended to persuade parents to vaccinate their children.”

On May 4, 2017, FactChecker declared as false, Del Bigtree’s statement, “Vaccines include aluminum and mercury, which are neurotoxins, and vaccines cause encephalopathy.”

FactChecker explained, “Current data show vaccines are safe and do not cause toxicity or encephalopathy.” [However], manufacturer’s inserts reveal that many vaccines contain aluminum and mercury, and cause encephalopathy. – Finally, massive gifts to NPR & PBS buy Gates biased vaccine coverage.

This statement is from public media Highwire.

“I’m (Robert Kennedy) not anti-vaccine. I’m against dangerous, shoddily tested, zero liability vaccines with toxic ingredients. If someone came up with a thoroughly tested vaccine that was completely safe and efficient, one that performed as promised, one that made people healthier rather than sicker, I’d be for it. – Indeed, only an idiot would oppose it.

But under no condition, would I support mandatory vaccination. Government has no right to force citizens to take unwanted medicines or to submit to involuntary medical interventions.”

And he adds:

“Google is a vaccine company. It has a $760 million partnership with Glaxo-the world’s largest vaccine maker and similar deals with Sanofi and Merck to mine your medical information. Googles mother company, Alphabet, has 4 vaccines developers working on flu, and other, vaccines.”

Google and Youtube are removing videos from highly experienced doctors, epidemiologists, biologists and virologists – censuring is also the new normal – but they are promoting a billionaire software developer and a 16 year old climate change “expert” about viruses and vaccines — what does that say for the media, for the governments that support and finance the media.

The Strategy behind shouting Conspiracy – Conspiracy Theorist

There is a lot of psychology behind the strategy – leading people to a state of cognitive dissonance, of believing a narrative they know is a fiction, meaning, you know there is something not quite right, but you don’t’ dare questioning it. Why? Because of being called a conspiracy theorist. And why does that matter? Because it is a demeaning term, robbing the accused of his credibility (well thought-out by the CIA in the 1950s). Somebody stamped as a conspiracy theorist, believing in conspiracy theories – in fake news, makes you a lesser person in your friends’ eyes. So, they may avoid you – and if you stick to your opinion, you may gradually move into isolation. Being isolated, no friends, is fear-provoking. So, better believe the official narrative.

The silver lining around this dark cloud is ever more visible and ever brighter.

Be self-assured. Don’t cave in.

Stick to your own research, to your fact-based opinion, regardless of being insulted as a conspiracy theorist. Stand up for what you believe – and do it with passion. Other people also have doubts, and when they see people defending their believes with passion, they may join you. And so, a critical mass grows. And the conspiracy theory strategy loses rapidly power – and fades away. Fading is already visible throughout European and US cities, where tens of thousands take to the streets, defending their civil and human and Constitutional Rights.

These are encouraging signs. Hope never fades – until “we shall overcome.”",1,
513,'Stay at home' New Zealand PM urges ahead of coronavirus lockdown - Reuters,Praveen Menon,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urged New Zealanders on Tuesday to reduce contacts to a bare minimum to help fight the coronavirus, as the country prepared for a one-month lockdown. New Zealandâ€™s cases of the coronavirus crossed the 100 mark this week as the government imposed self-isolation for everyone, with all non-essential services, schools and offices to be shut for a month from midnight on Wednesday. New Zealand has fewer infections than many other countries but Ardernâ€™s government wants to move fast to halt the spread. It was one of the first to force all arriving travellers into self-isolation and to ban indoor and outdoor gatherings. Cases in neighbouring Australia have soared to 1,886 but it has yet to announce a nationwide lockdown. â€œSimplest thing is to stay at home ... thatâ€™s how we will save lives,â€ Ardern told a news conference at parliament. â€œThe underlying principle of an alert level 4 is to reduce contact between people to the bare minimum,â€ she said. Parliament will sit on Wednesday to impose the state of emergency and lockdown, she said. The prime minister said the lockdown would give the country of about 5 million people a good chance of beating the virus but it would only work if everyone followed the restrictions. New Zealand has a total of 155 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus, with four local transmission cases. It has had no deaths. Under the lockdown, people can go out for a walk or take their children out but they have to keep a distance of 2 metres from others. They can also go to supermarkets. On Tuesday, office staff were preparing to work from home while students moved out of their hostels and cafes shut down. Domestic airports and other regional transport services were choked as people headed home before the lockdown. In the capital of Wellington, ferry services going from the North Island to the South Island were packed, as were supermarkets with people stocking up with food despite government assurances the country will be well supplied. Retail banks agreed to offer a six-month principal and interest payment holiday for mortgage holders and small business customers, the finance minister, Grant Robertson, said. â€œA six-month mortgage holiday for people whose incomes have been affected by COVID-19 will mean people wonâ€™t lose their homes as a result of the economic disruption caused by this virus,â€ Robertson said. The government and banks would also implement a NZ$6.25 billion ($3.62 billion) business finance guarantee scheme for small and medium-sized businesses, he said. The scheme will include a limit of NZ$500,000 per loan and will apply to firms with a turnover of between NZ$250,000 and NZ$80 million per annum. The government will carry 80% of the credit risk, with the other 20% to be carried by the banks, Robertson said. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) had decided to reduce banksâ€™ core funding ratios to 50% from 75%, further helping banks make credit available.

345,Gold slides 2% as Trump's restart plan boosts risk sentiment,,"Gold fell as much as 2% on Friday after President Donald Trump's new guidelines to re-open the U.S. economy and encouraging early data related to a potential COVID-19 treatment drove investors towards riskier assets. Spot gold was down 1.7% at $1,689.22 an ounce, more than $60 lower than the 7-1/2 peak hit earlier this week on concerns over the worst recession in decades. ""Gold and stocks are negatively correlated today with the overnight equity rally pressuring gold. The guidelines from Trump for re-opening the economy have boosted equity markets,"" said Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO. ""If stocks can extend overnight gains it could trigger more profit-taking in gold,"" he added. World stock markets sprinted towards a second straight week of gains after Trump laid out plans to gradually reopen the coronavirus-hit U.S. economy. Bullion has on occasion moved in tandem with stock markets this year, with recent sharp sell-offs prompting investors to sell precious metals to cover their losses elsewhere. Late on Thursday, Trump outlined a plan to ease the shutdown in a staggered, three-stage process, but the plan was a set of recommendations rather than orders and left the decision largely up to state governors. Also lifting the mood, a report detailed encouraging data from trials of U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc's experimental drug remdesivir in severely ill COVID-19 patients. The pandemic has infected more than 2 million people globally and killed 143,744. Many countries have extended lockdowns to curtail its spread, while central banks have unleashed a wave of monetary support measures. ""Risk appetite is soaring, but it might be overdone as permanent damage to the economy will see a battered U.S. consumer,"" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at broker OANDA, in a note. ""Gold will remain supported by the boatload of monetary and fiscal stimulus that will be in place for the foreseeable future. In the event of a deeper pullback, the $1,650 level remains key support."" U.S. gold futures slipped 1.6% to $1,704.70 an ounce, narrowing their lead over London spot prices, signalling hopes for an improvement in strained supply chain logistics that have hampered bullion shipments to the United States to meet contract requirements. Among other precious metals, palladium gained 0.9% to $2,173.44 an ounce, silver dropped 3.3% to $15.11 and platinum fell 1.8% to $768.98.",0,
83,Coronavirus shock claim: ‘Smoking gun of Chinese lab leak’ exposed by bioweapons expert,CALLUM HOARE,"The Professor of international law at the University of Illinois served on the board of directors of Amnesty International, the Advisory Board for the Council for Responsible Genetics and drafted the US legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989.

Appearing as a guest on the Alex Jones Show last month, he said: “I have come up with what I conclude to be the smoking gun that the Wuhan coronavirus came out of that level four facility. 

“You’ll note now that Senator Cotton saying the same thing he was behind me at Harvard law school, and despite that, the New York Times slammed him. “So yes, I have this scientific study now, I read these over the weekend, which is why I've changed my mind. “I want to go through this scientific study so that you and the viewing audience understand their implications,  I believe they are the smoking gun of what happened here.

""It was published on antiviral research February 10, 2020, I read this over the weekend, now I’m not going to go through this whole study, but they did a genetic analysis of the Wuhan coronavirus.”

Professor Boyle is referring to a study titled “Coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade,” revealed by Express.co.uk yesterday.

Published on ScienceDirect this month, the paper identified a ""gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population compared to other coronaviruses"".

Professor Boyle added: “Let me just conclude, the critical part here where it says: ‘And may provide a gain of function to the 2019 nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population compared to other beta coronaviruses.’ “And the smoking gun here is on page 11, near the bottom, the last full paragraph from the bottom where it says: ‘May provide a gain of function to coronavirus for efficient spreading in the human population.

“‘Gain of function technology is DNA genetic engineering of a dangerous biological warfare substance, but turbocharging and gain of function work can only be done safely in a BSL-4 or a BSL-3 facility.’

“So, I think clearly that the Wuhan coronavirus came out of that BSL-4 facility, this is clearly a weaponised biological warfare agent and there is no legitimate scientific or medical use for gain of function technology.”

But, Professor Boyle is jumping the gun slightly, as the paper does not specifically refer to genetic engineering.

The medical definition for gain-of-function, also known as GOF, is a mutation that confers new or enhanced activity on a protein.

While gain-of-function research can involve genetic engineering, it can also be naturally occurring in the virus.",1,
425,Would Trump Actually Pay Oil Producers Not To Pump? | OilPrice.com,Haley Zaremba,"The global oil industry has been scrambling for a solution to the dramatic oil price crash and enduring global crude glut from last month. As the novel coronavirus swept the globe over the past few months, shutting down countless industrial endeavors, the devastating economic impact tanked international oil demand and overall energy use. When the OPEC leading members of Russia and Saudi Arabia began talks to determine how to respond to the faltering oil demand, the alliance quickly disintegrated, leading to an all-out oil price war and a global crude glut to the tune of about 10 million barrels of oversupply per day.  On Sunday OPEC decided to try to reduce the glut and thereby bolster oil prices with historic production cuts. On Monday the coalition led by Russia and Saudi Arabia announced that they will slash production by a whopping 9.7 million barrels in May and June. The United States, for its part, has been typically polarized as to how to respond to the crisis in global oil markets.&nbsp;  Before the Sunday announcement from OPEC Trump had been entertaining oil lobbyists from two different camps, arguing over whether the United States should impose tariffs on Moscow and Riyadh, and the President had made public statements that he planned to impose &ldquo;very substantial&rdquo; tariffs on oil imports to the United States.  Now, the Trump administration has changed its tune and is considering discouraging U.S. oil producers to curb their own oil extraction. &ldquo;The Trump administration is contemplating paying oil companies to leave their product in the ground, a measure that could help boost the struggling industry while the market has been crushed by an oversupply of crude,&rdquo; The Hill reported this week. &ldquo;According to reporting from multiple outlets, the Department of Energy DOE is drafting a plan that would pay companies to leave as much as 365 million barrels untapped by considering it part of the nation&rsquo;s emergency stockpile.&rdquo;  Premium The Oil Sector That Will Suffer The Most  This news has sent shockwaves through the domestic energy sector, which has never seen this kind of unprecedented policy from the federal government. This initiative is still in a very tentative phase, however, as this plan &ldquo;would be unprecedented and likely to face resistance from Congress, where Democrats were able to thwart a $3 billion request to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve SPR outright.&rdquo;  This has not stopped President Trump, however, from speaking publicly and assertively about the idea, saying that &ldquo;the government should stock up on oil while prices are at historic lows, and the DOE plan appears to already have some support from Republicans,&rdquo; as paraphrased by The Hill. The DOE has not yet sent a formal proposal to Congress, but existing legislation dictates that &ldquo;federal law allows DOE to set aside up to 1 billion barrels of oil for emergencies, but it doesn&rsquo;t stipulate where it must be stored.&rdquo; To this point, President Trump has repeatedly spoken about the possibility for oil companies to store crude oil on private tanker ships, and some crude is already being stowed in rail cars.&nbsp;  Even if they go through, however, these measures will do little to put a dent in the current crude glut. What&rsquo;s more, the considerable more austere measures taken by OPEC over the weekend have so far done little to correct the market either. &ldquo;Even with market forces expected to drive U.S. oil companies to drop production by 500,000 barrels a day, a little less than 5 percent of average production,&rdquo; reports The Hill, &ldquo;the market is still facing a glut of oil as demand for fuel has declined 30 percent in the midst of the coronavirus.&rdquo;  Energy demand will not bounce back in the immediate future, either, as the global economic shutdown persists, and some countries are only now beginning widespread shelter-in-place measures.

450,Mike Tyson would KO Deontay Wilder in ONE MINUTE - ex-trainer hits out at Bronze Bomber | Boxing | Sport | Express.co.uk,Chisanga Malata,"  Deontay Wilder wouldn't last a minute in the ring with a Mike Tyson, according to the former undisputed heavyweight champion's old coach Jeff Fenech. Over the last two years, the boxing world has been debating who would win a fantasy fight between the pair. Much of the intrigue in the fantasy bout stems from the pair's ridiculous knockout power, with Wilder regarded by many as the hardest-hitting heavyweight since 'Iron Mike'. Wilder's mesmerising record attests to that fact, with the American knocking out all but one of his 41 professional opponents. In fact, the Olympic bronze medallist firmly believes he would've got the better of Tyson if they fought in the same era. Speaking after his knockout victory over Luis Ortiz last November, he said: ""What I do is not textbook, you can't really reach it and that's what makes me unique and different to other fighters. JUST IN: Anthony Joshua explains why he didn't mock Wilder after Fury loss  Iâ€™d guarantee that if Mike Tyson trained for six weeks, heâ€™d knock Wilder out in a minute Mike Tyson's former trainer Jeff Fenech ""At this point in time I've earned my due respect and credit. I am the hardest-hitting puncher in boxing history, period, and I've earned that."" Fenech disagrees with the notion that Wilder would best Tyson and firmly believes 'The Baddest Man on the Planet' would mop the floor with the former WBC heavyweight champion at the ripe old age of 53. â€œBoxingâ€™s not the same now. Iâ€™d guarantee that if Mike Tyson trained for six weeks, heâ€™d knock Wilder out in a minute,â€ Fenech told Sporting News. â€œHe would hit them. If these guys are getting knocked out by Tyson Fury â€“ whoâ€™s a great fighter, but not a huge puncher â€“ Tyson would kill these guys. DON'T MISS Anthony Joshua explains why he's willing to fight Pulev in empty arena Anthony Joshua predicts outcome of Tyson Fury unification fight Deontay Wilder blasted by boxing legend Roy Jones Jr â€œTheyâ€™re not on the same level today.â€ Despite being significantly shorter than the likes of Wilder, Fury and Anthony Joshua, Fenech firmly believes a prime Tyson would run riot in the today's heavyweight division. He added: â€œMike today, I reckon if he trained he could still beat these guys. â€œFuryâ€™s got these other skills, but Deontay Wilderâ€™s got a punch and nothing else. If you punch him, itâ€™s over. And Mike donâ€™t miss.â€  Wilder and Fury, 34 and 31 respectively, are set to renew their rivalry in Las Vegas in the autumn. Their third meeting was initially slated to take place in July but has been delayed until October due to the coronavirus outbreak. A date for their trilogy fight has not yet been announced, although it's been reported they will lock horns on October 3.

298,Saudis shed light on oil production increase that rattled markets | Business | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/phillipinman,"Saudi Arabia, the worldâ€™s biggest oil exporter, has spelled out details of the dramatic increase in its production that prompted Mondayâ€™s huge falls in global stock markets and is regarded as a targeted attack on the US shale oil industry. The state-owned oil firm Saudi Aramco said in April, when a three-year Opec deal with Russia expires, it would increase output from 9.7m barrels per day (bpd) to 12.3m, flooding the market and bringing oil prices lower. On Monday, Brent crude plunged more than 30% to its lowest levels since February 2016. The drop was the biggest one-day percentage decline since the first Gulf war began in 1991. Within hours of the Saudi statement, Occidental Petroleum, the biggest shale oil producer in the US, slashed its dividend payout from 79 to 11 cents a share. The Houston-based company, which spent $57bn with mostly borrowed funds to buy the oil and gas rival Anadarko Petroleum last year, announced it would also cut investment this year to between $3.5bn and $3.7bn, from $5.2bn to $5.4bn in 2019, to cope with an expected drop in operating profits and a 50% dive in its share value after the price crash. â€œDue to the sharp decline in global commodity prices, we are taking actions that will strengthen our balance sheet and continue to reduce debt,â€ the company said. Several of the largest shale oil producers are heavily in debt and known to be unprofitable with an oil price below $50 a barrel. John Forsythe, the chief global strategist at Boston-based BrightSphere Investment, said: â€œContinuing downward price pressures on the heavily leveraged US oil and natural gas industry could lead to missed debt payments. â€œThat would have an outsized impact on the US economy given that the shale industry, for example, has accounted for as much as 10 percent of economic growth in recent years and the broader oil and natural gas industry supports more than 10 million jobs.â€ Oil prices had rebounded by 8% on Tuesday after Russia signalled that talks to limit supplies in line with the Opec oil cartel, which broke down last Friday and triggered the biggest price drop in nearly 30 years, were still possible. It was the breakdown of talks with Russia at the weekend that prompted Saudi Arabia to turn on the taps and push down the price. The talks had been expected to agree production cuts, to maintain prices at a time when the global economy is under increasing pressure. The price of Brent crude rose $2.80 to $37.16 a barrel by lunchtime after investors were reassured by the Russian intervention and other moves by Japan and the US. Tokyo announced a second $4bn economic stimulus package, while Donald Trump said he would push for tax cuts to tackle the economic spillovers of the coronavirus. The Russian oil minister, Alexander Novak, said he did not rule out joint measures with Opec to stabilise the market, adding that the next meeting to discuss production levels and prices was planned for May-June. However, Saudi Arabiaâ€™s energy minister told Reuters he did not see a need to hold a meeting in May-June if there was no agreement on what measures should be taken to deal with the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand and prices. â€œI fail to see the wisdom for holding meetings in May-June that would only demonstrate our failure in attending to what we should have done in a crisis like this and taking the necessary measures,â€ Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said. Oil company share prices recovered some of their Monday losses, with BP adding 11% to close at 333p and Shell up 3.7% to Â£13.66. Before this weekâ€™s stock market collapse, Shellâ€™s share price in London was above Â£16 a share. Analysts at RBC said: â€œPrice wars and pandemics are nothing new to the commodity markets, but both occurring simultaneously is something we have yet to witness in our careers.â€ They said without a deal between Russia and the Opec countries it was difficult to see where the oil price would settle. The last time the price of Brent crude dropped below $40 a barrel in 2016, the US shale oil boom was in full flow and global oil markets were flooded with supply.",0,
62,COVID-19 and the CIA’s Biological Warfare on Cuba,Timothy Alexander Guzman,"Maybe it was a plan that went horribly wrong, something they could no longer control. Was the Corona virus or COVID-19 spread intentionally? What if this virus was used against China as a weapon of choice to destabilize China’s economy and push back against China’s growing influence? We don’t know for sure, but it is possible. Investigations are ongoing. Nothing has not been confirmed.

But what has been confirmed is what history has taught us given the facts on how the use of biological warfare for various purposes, against many peoples and nations has been happening for some time. One of the most well-known incidents of biological warfare occurred in 1763, the British Empire had planned and successfully managed to spread smallpox virus to the Native Americans during the Pontiac Rebellion in Pennsylvania. Chief Pontiac of the Ottawa launched an attack on Fort Detroit, a British military base.

Other nations joined the rebellion including the Senecas, the Hurons, Delawares, and Miamis. As the war raged, an Indian delegation asked the British to surrender, but they refused, however, the British offered gifts including food, alcohol and material items that included two blankets and a handkerchief from people who had smallpox. Although the American Indians had experienced the disease in the past, the idea was to spread the disease among the Native American populations in an attempt to push back the rebellion or to defeat it once and for all.

Another example of biological warfare was when Imperial Japan before and during World War II had a bio-weapons program that managed to drop numerous bombs on a number of Chinese cities from airplanes killing an estimated 580,000 Chinese people with bombs that were made of infected fleas, some even contained cholera and shigella during the Sino-Japanese war between the 1930′s and 1940′s.

In 1981, the CIA with help from U.S. military had launched an operation against Cuba by unleashing a strain of Dengue Fever also known as “hemorrhagic fever’ effecting more than 273,000 people killing 158 including 101 children. On September 6, 1981, The New York Times reported on Fidel Castro’s comments regarding the U.S. government in particularly, blaming the CIA for the outbreak when he said that

”we urge the United States Government to define its policy in this field, to say whether the C.I.A. will or will not be authorized again- or has already been authorized – to organize attacks against leaders of the revolution and to use plagues against our plants, our animals and our people.”

The report said that the“epidemic of dengue fever that has made 340,000 people ill and has killed about 150″ but the State Department under-then President Ronald Reagan stated that “Mr. Castro’s charges of possible United States involvement in the epidemic were ”totally without foundation.” The State department quickly blamed the Castro’s revolution as a failure:

The Geopolitical Deployment of Biological Weapons
The Cuban Government has always tried to blame the United States for its failures and its internal problems,” the department said. ”The Cuban revolution is a failure, and it is obviously easier to blame external forces like the United States than to admit those failures”.

Dr, Ronald St. John, chief of communicable diseases for the Pan American Health Organization was interviewed by the New York Times said that “for the first time, so-called dengue-2 spread to Cuba.” Dr. St. John claimed that it is common in Southeast Asia and that it produces

“the same symptoms as the other three” and that ”if you get a wave of dengue-1, dengue-3 or dengue-4 and then another wave of type 2, this is a bad combination.”

Dengue-2 causes you too loose body fluids causing shocks that can lead to eventually death. Convenient for the CIA who saw it as an opportunity to cause panic on Cuba which is located in one of the most hot and humid regions in the world. However, The New York Times managed to downplay Cuba’s accusation’s by ending the story by blaming the spread of the disease on returning Cuban troops from Africa and other people from other parts of the Caribbean who might have brought Dengue fever into Cuba:

Some State Department officials believe the introduction of dengue-2 into Cuba is a result of the return to Cuba of troops who had been stationed in Angola or elsewhere in Africa, where the strain is found. But Dr. St. John said dengue-2 had been found in other parts of the Caribbean and might have been carried to Cuba from there or elsewhere overseas

Reports suggested that Cuba had a very small number of cases in 1944, and again in 1977. The 1981 outbreak was blamed on covert flyover operations conducted by the CIA with military owned airplanes, you know, the same airplanes that were most probably used against Nicaragua’s Sandinistas to transport weapons and other materials to the Contras around the same time.

Since the 20th century, the U.S. has been the leader in developing various biological and chemical weapons through the U.S. Army’s Biological Warfare Laboratories based at Fort Detrick, Maryland since the late 1940′s, around the start of the Cold War.

The U.S. biological warfare program that supposedly ended in 1969 developed a handful of biological weapons ready for use including anthrax, Q-fever and botulism and conducted research in hopes of weaponizing diseases including smallpox, Hantavirus, Lassa fever, yellow fever, typhus, dengue fever and the bird flu among them.

An article from August 6, 2019 on Fort Detrick from the UK’s ‘The Independent’ titled ‘Research into deadly viruses and biological weapons at US army lab shut down over fears they could escape’ last August. Ironically, Secretary of State and Neocon Mike Pompeo called it the “Wuhan virus” since they blame China for the outbreak, but it seems that the U.S. had its own problems when it comes to their own labs who conduct research with the most deadly viruses:

America’s main biological warfare lab has been ordered to stop all research into the deadliest viruses and pathogens over fears contaminated waste could leak out of the facility. Fort Detrick, in Maryland, has been the epicentre of the US Army’s bioweapons research since the beginning of the Cold War. But last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – the government’s public health body – stripped the base of its license to handle highly restricted “select agents”, which includes Ebola, smallpox and anthrax

The story was basically about the CDC who inspected Fort Detrick and found problems with new procedures used to decontaminate waste water. The article says that Fort Detrick continued its research for defensive purposes to “protect the warfighter from biological threats” although the U.S. declared that it abandoned their biological weapons program since 1969:

Although the United States officially abandoned its biological weapons programme in 1969, Fort Detrick has continued defensive research into deadly pathogens on the list of “select agents”, including the Ebola virus, the organisms that cause the plague, and the highly toxic poison ricin. The army’s Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, based at Fort Detrick, says its primary mission today is to “protect the warfighter from biological threats” but its scientists also investigate outbreaks of disease among civilians and other threats to public health. In recent years it has been involved in testing possible vaccines for Ebola, after several epidemics of the deadly virus in Africa

Sooner or later, the truth will come out. I believe that the U.S. government knows how COVID-19 began and where it was going. The U.S. government and major corporate arms manufacturers and the rest of the Military-Industrial Complex is no stranger to biological weapons adding to their arsenal of nuclear and chemical weapons at their disposal which makes them, much more dangerous. The truth about COVID-19 will eventually come out. In the meantime, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, a war against Russia, China, Iran or Venezuela is in the works and a coming economic crisis with an election coming this November seems like 2020 will be the year of a perfect storm.",1,
143,World Health Organization Demanded Sweden Lock Down To Cover Its Own Fraud,Martin Armstrong,"The New York Times and others are out in full force to defend Bill Gates, their savior of the world. They distort everything and try to pretend he is this wonderful man who only our best interests at heart. They also refuse to address how the World Health Organization has carried out the greatest fraud perhaps in modern history and the links of the United States to the drive for Climate Change also go back to Bill Gates. The press refuses to expose the World Health Organization (WHO) which called for Sweden to take more action, telling CNN that it is “imperative” that Sweden “increase measures to control spread of the virus, prepare and increase capacity of the health system to cope, ensure physical distancing and communicate the why and how of all measures to the population.”

Note that the entire theory for the lockdown was that they agreed with Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, also a target for donations from the Gates Foundation, that 2 million Americans would die and we would not have enough bed space to accommodate the people. The WHO has tried to ignore Sweden where they did not lockdown everyone and the death rate was no worse than any other country and in fact. Sweden stands as a testament that this has been the greatest scam of all time which has used a virus to achieve the very same goals as Climate Change.

UNDER NO CONDITIONS should President Trump resume any support for WHO. All health organizations that want to pretend to be unbiased governmental agencies MUST stop taking private donations. That includes the CDC, NIH, and the WHO. Any university that accepts donations from the Gates Foundation should be PROHIBITED from providing any such studies whatsoever given that they have ALL been wrong concerning this staged viral Plandemic (a more realistic term for what they have done).

393,Brexit news: UK and EU face four hurdles before a deal can be done | UK | News | Express.co.uk,"Joe Barnes, Brussels Correspondent "," Officials will meet by video conference for a full week of negotiations as the process resumes after the coronavirus pandemic forced both sides to shelve plans for face-to-face talks. Chief negotiators David Frost and Michel Barnier havenâ€™t met since the first week of March, but agreed to reboot the talks. They have scheduled two further negotiating rounds for May 11 and June 1 as part of a cutdown timetable. Both sides were due to hold at least five weeks of negotiations before the middle of May, as agreed before the COVID-19 outbreak brought Europe to a standstill. Messrs Frost and Barnier will lead a high-level opening session this afternoon before handing down the majority of work to 11 sub-committees. Negotiators will discuss areas such as trade in goods and services, fisheries, and the so-called level-playing field to prevent unfair competition. There will also be discussions on road and aviation transport, energy and nuclear cooperation, justice and home affairs issues and how the overall deal should be set out before a closing session on Friday afternoon.   The talks face a dramatic escalation in the coming months after Boris Johnsonâ€™s Government signalled it would reject any further delays to Brexit. Mr Frost said: â€œTransition ends on December 31, we will not extend it. â€œIf the EU asks, we will say no.â€ This leaves both sides hunting significant process before a high-level meeting between Mr Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commissionâ€™s president, in June. The Prime Minister has previously warned he would walkaway from the negotiating table if a deal with Brussels looks unlikely and prepare for a World Trade Organisation exit from the EUâ€™s single market and customs union. Negotiators face challenges in bridging the gap between key four areas of divergences.  Brussels, and some of the blocâ€™s most influential leaders, have insisted on â€œupholdingâ€ reciprocal access to the UKâ€™s fishing waters as the price for any future trade deal. Britain, however, has insisted on taking back control of its waters as the cornerstone of its Brexit policy. The Government has decided to allow EU fishermen some access, but wants to decide this during annual negotiations with the EU Commission. Under the plans, quota shares will be divided up using new scientific methods instead of the blocâ€™s hated Common Fisheries Policy. MUST READ: UK using fishing as weapon to gain upper hand over EU in trade talks  The so-called â€œlevel playing fieldâ€ is at the heart of the EUâ€™s demands for any future relationship with Britain. Brussels wants to keep Britain tied to its state aid rules, which requires oversight from judges at European Court of Justice, and prevent the Government from slashing environmental and workersâ€™ rights standards. But Mr Frost has warned his army of over 100 negotiators that their role in the talks is to deliver on the result of the 2016 EU referendum, which means reclaiming sovereignty from the bloc. He has warned his EU counterparts that Britain will, under no circumstances, allow the ECJ any influence in UK law. DON'T MISSNo10 says Brexit MUST be done by end of 2020 and there's a good reason [ANALYSIS]EU already making plans to use UK cash to fund coronavirus recovery [EXCLUSIVE]UK could pay â€˜massiveâ€™ coronavirus EU payments if transition extended [INSIGHT]  Mr Barnier has said if Britain wants to continue working with Brussels on security and criminal justice this section of the deal must face oversight by the ECJ and the European Convention on Human Rights. The EUâ€™s chief negotiator insists any data-sharing agreements, which handles information on European citizens, should be enforceable by the blocâ€™s Luxembourg-based judges. But in line with his negotiating guidelines, Mr Frost has refused to accept this demand as part of any pact. The UK still wants to maintain as near as possible to the existing arrangements on the same basis as other third countries, such as Iceland Norway, who do not have full access to some of the EUâ€™s security databases and joint policing operations. Governance remains a huge challenge for both sides to overcome, with Brussels favouring an all-encompassing agreement and Britain instead hoping for a series of mini deals. Mr Barnier wants every aspect of the deal housed within a framework that is underpinned by governance and level playing field provisions. The Government is seeking to replicate standard free-trade agreements, such as the Canada pact, that have already been agreed with third countries by the bloc. Mr Frost argues he does not want as ambitious a deal as being sought by Brussels and is willing to settle for a bare bones agreement with a series of side deals.

382,Website selling fake coronavirus vaccine shut down by Justice Department,Matt Binder," The U.S. government is taking swift action on what is sure to be the first of many coronavirus-related scams. On Sunday, the Justice Department announced it had taken its first enforcement action in federal court to combat coronavirus-related fraud. The scam came from a website called â€œcoronavirusmedicalkit.comâ€ which was promoting supposed coronavirus vaccination kits from the World Health Organization. The website has since been taken down thanks to a court order. These vaccine kits do not exist. There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19. Experts estimate that a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away from being developed and made available. The federal government was able to take such quick action thanks to a statute that ""permits federal courts to issue injunctions to prevent harm to potential victims of fraudulent schemes."" The Justice Department says the investigation into the website and its operators is ongoing. Mashable has reached out to the Justice Department to find out more about how it discovered the fraudulent website and to find out how many people were possibly victimized. Justice Department Files Its First Enforcement Action against COVID-19 Fraud https://t.co/3A37F5a5xf â€” Justice Department (@TheJusticeDept) March 22, 2020 According to the DOJ statement, â€œcoronavirusmedicalkit.comâ€ was â€œengaging in a wire fraud scheme seeking to profit from the confusion and widespread fear surrounding COVID-19.â€ The website was charging a shipping fee of $4.95 for these nonexistent medical kits. The site also included fake testimonials from fictional customers. The scam website claimed that upon receiving the vaccine kit, the user needed to mix the ""drugs and vaccines"" contained in one ""pellet"" with a second pellet ""containing instructions"" telling the drugs ""which compound to create."" Once water is added to the concoction, the ""treatment is ready,"" according to the site.  A screenshot of the â€œcoronavirusmedicalkit.comâ€ homepage before it was removed. Image:  SCREENSHOT / DOMAINTOOLS.com A temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman required that Namecheap, the the domain's registrar, block access to the website. The â€œcoronavirusmedicalkit.comâ€ domain name was registered on March 4. In a statement, U.S. Attorney John F. Bash requested that domain registrars continue to act in order to â€œquickly and effectively shut down websites designed to facilitate these scams.â€ Attorney General William Barr has called for the Justice Department to prioritize illegal activity surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. Itâ€™s unclear who is behind the website. A WHOIS search for the domain can usually pull up the name and contact information for the registrant. However, â€œcoronavirusmedicalkit.comâ€ is using a WHOIS privacy service which obfuscates the registrants personal details. â€œThe Department of Justice will not tolerate criminal exploitation of this national emergency for personal gain,â€ said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justiceâ€™s Civil Division in a public statement.  â€œWe will use every resource at the governmentâ€™s disposal to act quickly to shut down these most despicable of scammers, whether they are defrauding consumers, committing identity theft, or delivering malware.â€",0,
124,Romania develops Coronavirus Vaccine able to Cure White People only,Anonymous,"Romanian scientists have just developed a working vaccine which is able to cure the 2019-nCov virus (also known as novo coronavirus).

Turns out human races are different in more ways not just skin color as mentally incapacitated liberals would have you believe. Liberalism is the biggest disease the world has ever seen, its a disease so great that it kills people in many ways. One of the ways now is the inability to study this virus the right way.

Human races are different and they have different immune systems with different reactions.

So it took a bunch of Romanian scientists to study and come up with the right answer to this mess:

“We’ve put up a new scientific report on our institute’s website, which is hard to understand by the ones who are not in the medical field but in short, we began to study a new approach to vaccines since the last Ebola pandemic because we thought that vaccines through their traditional methods used until now will soon be unable to work on new viruses as they have reached their limits. I cannot tell you if a mass population vaccine for all peoples will work or not but if it would, it would have been released by now.

This is about an individual populations vaccine. We studied Romania’s immune system’s characteristics which are of Caucasian descent and which is generally found throughout Europe and North America. Now taking into account those immune characteristics and the diverse responses to various antigens such as Coronavirus, we proposed a mix of antigens, peptides and proteins and we were able to find a cure which would be able to cover Romania’s entire population explained Dr. Virgil Paunescu head of Institute of Research OncoGen Timisoara.

If we had the necessary equipment we would be able to produce the vaccine faster. We will order those peptides from Germany in the form of powder and we should receive it in a month. We will then conduct tests and hope we will get the results we are hoping for. From this point we cannot produce a large scale of this vaccine, we just came up with a solution, the current approach is a compromise between an industrial large-scale global vaccination strategy and an individually-targeted personalized vaccination strategy which is generally more expensive to produce, said Dr. Virgil Paunescu.”

According to the research published on their institute’s website, the research is “Based on this model, additional peptide candidates can be identified for the Caucasian population from different geographic regions and for other communities.”

Well boyz and galz, as we already knew, it turns out that there is more to it than just skin color, a lot more!!!! There’s plenty of diseases which are racially based but because a liberal curtain has been pulled over our eyes not even science is able to function properly!

We have as a part of medicine the fact that certain races experience certain health issues:

Cystic fibrosis, the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disease among people of Northern European heritage
Sickle-cell anemia, most prevalent in populations with sub-Saharan African ancestry but also common among Latin American, Middle Eastern populations, as well as those people of South European regions such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy
Thalassemia, most prevalent in populations having Mediterranean ancestry, to the point that the disease’s name is derived from Greek thalasson, “sea”
Tay–Sachs disease, an autosomal recessive disorder most common among Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, Cajuns of Louisiana and Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania
Hereditary hemochromatosis, most common among persons having Northern European ancestry, in particular those people of Celtic descent
Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome, most common among Puerto Ricans
Finnish heritage diseases, autosomal recessive diseases that are far more common among Finns
Many disorders that are much more common in Ashkenazi Jews. Never forget dumb retarded liberals, its only skin color, there is NO OTHER DIFFERENCE between human races but don’t you dare say there’s no difference between dog races or breeds, which its the same thing. Race/breed are synonymous words. Liberals are so brain dead they even use scientifically incapacitated terms such as “human race”. There is no “human race” you dumb animals.

Its called the human species and within this species there’s plenty of races/breeds such as the caucasoid race, the negroid, mongoloid, australoid, semitic and others, each with their own different set of haplogroup genes. Those genes do not dictate only the colors of our skins, its not like your skin is a freaking coat of various colors. It dictates different biological traits such as strength, stamina, metabolism, height, intelligence, immune systems and plenty of other things.

Almost all species of the earth have sub-breeds/races. Even bears do, you can’t f-king say ohhh all bears are the same, its only the color of their fur that differs. Are you like mentally ill? Yes… liberals are.

Did you know for example that its extremely difficult for mongoloids (Asians) to get fat because their metabolism is much faster than ours? It burns calories at a significantly faster rate than us.

In order for a Han Chinese person to get fat he/she has to eat like almost non-stop… Europeans can go for days without eating but Chinese can’t skip meals or they will start to shake and get dizzy.

Asians also don’t even need to use deodorants as they barely sweat because Allele G and Allele A frequencies are very different among human races. Africans have the highest percentage of body odor for example. Europeans have medium to high, East Asians, especially Chinese and Koreans have little to ZERO body odor, their genes also do NOT produce any yellow ear wax. Chinese are lactose intolerant, almost all of them. They cannot consume any diary products.

Let’s take it deeper into the rabbit hole. If you mixed with someone of a different race (let’s say Asian) and you have a child and that child is in need of a heart, kidney or any other organ, did you know that the child is going to be doomed? Donor organs from both whites (you) and Asians are going to be incompatible. The child is going to be doomed.

So STFU with your liberal mental illness “ohhhhhhh we’re all the same, who cares about color of the skin”!? Who cares? Science does! Who are you to say such words? Are you a scientist? No, you’re just a dumb insignificant ant in the colony.

Liberals are like the psycho fanatical Christians of the Dark Ages who burned anyone at the stake for the slightest reason, accused of being a heretic. Talking about race even scientifically is the heresy of the 21st century. This will be our doom, not just to whites but to everyone.",1,
505,UK coronavirus news: Covid 19 lockdown could extend to 2021  | UK | News | Express.co.uk,James Bickerton,"  On Saturday authorities announced another 888 coronavirus related deaths in UK hospitals. This takes the total to over 15,000 since the crisis began.   However the real figure may well be significantly higher, as home and care home deaths arenâ€™t included in the Governmentâ€™s figures.  The Government has extended Britainâ€™s coronavirus lockdown for another three weeks.  There are growing concerns in Whitehall about the impact this will have on the economy.  Speaking to the Sunday Times one source compared the economic consequences of a greatly extended lockdown to â€œthe end of civilisationâ€.      Another said: â€œIf we donâ€™t start lifting the lockdown in the next few weeks there wonâ€™t be anything left to come back to.â€  The paper reports a briefing document seem by ministers warns 60 percent of businesses will run out of cash reserves within three months whilst some airlines will run out of money â€œwithin a matter of weeksâ€.  The report also suggests six out of ten local newspapers could go bust whilst a third of fashion companies will come under threat within a month.  Under current lockdown rules people should only leave the house for essential shopping, once a day for exercise or to work if they canâ€™t do so from home.

159,Putin And Trump vs The New World Order: The Final Battle,Sylvain LAFOREST,"We live in exciting times.

The unknown that lays ahead for all of us is both exhilarating and scary. Exhilarating in the long term, but rather scary in the short term. All empires eventually die and we’re in the terminal phase of the New World Order that will not recover from the Russian roulette game it has been playing, for Vladimir Putin handed it a loaded gun and it pulled the trigger.

The last few weeks put everything in place for the last battle. There are so many different facts and events, left and right, and I will try to do my best to remain methodical in this complicated expose. Bare with me, I’ve been struggling for three weeks with this article because of the insane amount of additional details that each day provides. It might have been a wrong time to quit smoking, but I enjoy a good challenge.

Dropping dollars
A little context is required. The New World Order concept is simply the wish of a handful of international bankers that want to economically and politically rule the whole planet as one happy family. It started in 1773 and if it went through important changes over the years, but the concept and objective haven’t changed an iota. Unfortunately for them, international banks that have been looting the planet through the US dollar since 1944 are now threatened by hyperinflation, as their printing machine has been rotating for years to cover their absurd spendings to sustain oil and resource wars that they’ve all ultimately lost. In order to prevent this upcoming hyperinflation, they generated a virus attack on four countries (China, Iran, Italy and now the United States) to spread panic in the population, with the precious help of their ignominious medias. Even though this corona virus isn’t different from any new viruses that attack humans every year, the media scare pushed people to voluntarily isolate themselves through fear and terror. Some lost their jobs, companies are going bankrupt, the panic created a stock exchange crash that emptied wallets and dried assets, resulting in a few trillion virtual dollars off the market to release pressure off the currency.

So far, so good, but everything else went wrong in this desperate and ultimate banzai. The top virologist on the planet confirmed that chloroquine was being used by the Chinese with spectacular results to cure patients, then he improved his magic potion by adding a pneumonic antibacterial called azythromicin, and saved everyone of his first 1000 cases, but one. Donald Trump immediately imposed the same treatment through a fight against his own Federal Drug Administration, bought and owned by the deep state. This forced all medias to talk about Dr Didier Raoult’s Miracle Elixir, signing the death warrant on our confidence in all Western governments, their medical agencies, the World Health Organization, and medias that were trying to destroy the impeccable doctor’s reputation, while inventing sudden «dangerous side effects» of a nearly inoffensive drug that has been used for 60 years to treat malaria. Not so far away in Germany, internationally praised Dr Wolfgand Wodarg noted that the engineered panic was totally useless, since this virus isn’t any different than the others that affect us every years. This has been an amazing victory for Trump and the general population on social medias, whom exposed together the pathological lies of the official communication channels of every New World Order country. De facto, the credibility’s of these puppet governments have vanished in the air, and from the eye of the storm, Italy will surely exit the EU right after the crisis, which will trigger a domino effect running through every EU countries and NATO members. My friends, globalism is dead and ready for cremation.

Digging the abyss
International bankers couldn’t see it coming in 1991, when they dominated 95% of the planet after the fall of the Soviet Union. It seemed that nothing could halt their ultimate mission to complete their Orwellian dream: destroy a few countries in the Middle East, enlarge Israel, and get the total control over the world oil market, the last piece of their Xanadu puzzle that they’ve been working on for a whole century, starting with the Balfour declaration in 1917.

When Vladimir Putin got charge of Russia, there was no sign that he would do better than the drunk he had replaced. An ex KGB officer seemed like a choice more driven by nostalgia rather than ideology, but Putin had many more assets going for him than first met the eyes: patriotism, humanism, a sense of justice, cunning ruse, a genius economist friend named Sergey Glazyev whom openly despised the New World Order, but above all, he embodied the reincarnation of the long lost Russian ideology of total political and economical independence. After a few years spent at draining the Russian swamp from the oligarchs and mafiosis that his stumbling predecessor had left in his trail of empty bottles, Vlad rolled his sleeves and got to work.

Because his opponents had been looting the planet for 250 years through colonization insured by a military domiAnonymousce, Vlad knew that he had to start by building an invincible military machine. And he did. He came up with different types of hypersonic missiles that can’t be stopped, the best defensive systems on the planet, the best electronic jamming systems, and the best planes. Then to make sure that a nuclear war wouldn’t be an option, he came up with stuff which nightmares are made of, such as the Sarmat, the Poseidon and the Avangard, all unstoppable and able to destroy any country in a matter of a few hours.

Putin and the military
Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, gestures while speaking during an annual meeting with top military officials in the National Defense Control Center in Moscow, December 24, 2019. Putin said that Russia is the only country in the world that has hypersonic weapons even though its military spending is a fraction of the U.S. military budget. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, left, and Chief of General Staff of Russia Valery Gerasimov, right, attend the meeting.
With a new and unmatched arsenal, he could proceed to defeat any NATO force or any of its proxies, as he did starting in September 2015 in Syria. He proved to every country that independence from the NWO banking system was now a matter of choice. Putin not only won the Syrian war, but he won the support of many New World Order countries that suddenly switched sides upon realizing how invincible Russia had become. On a diplomatic level, it also got mighty China by its side, and then managed to protect independent oil producers such as Venezuela and Iran, while leaders like Erdogan of Turkey and Muhammad Ben Salman of Saudi Arabia decided to side with Russia, who isn’t holding the best poker hand, but the whole deck of cards.

Ending in the conclusion that Putin now controls the all-mighty oil market, the unavoidable energy resource that lubricates economies and armies, while the banksters’ NATO can only watch, without any means to get it back. With the unbelievable results that Putin has been getting in the last five years, the New World Order suddenly looks like a house of cards about to crumble. The Empire of Banks has been terminally ill for five years, but it’s now on morphine, barely realizing what’s going on.

Tragedy and hope
Since there is no hope in starting WW3 which is lost in advance, the last banzai came out of the bushes in the shape of a virus and the ensuing media creation of a fake pandemic. The main focus was to avoid a catastrophic hyperinflation of the humongous mass of US dollar that no one wants anymore, to have time to implement their virtual world crypto-currency, as if the chronically failing bankers still have any legitimacy to keep controlling our money supplies. It seemed at first that the plan could work. That’s when Vlad took out his revolver to start the Russian roulette game and bankers blew their brains out upon the pressure on the trigger.

He called a meeting with OPEP and killed the price of oil by refusing to lower Russia’s production, taking the barrel to under 30 dollars. Without any afterthought and certainly even less remorse, Vlad killed the costly Western oil production. All the dollars that had been taken out of the market had to be re-injected by the Fed and other central banks to avoid a downslide and the final disaster. By now, our dear bankers are out of solutions.

In the meantime, Trump also poked at the tie-wearing gangsters. While medias avoided the corona-killing chloroquine subject, an old pill designed to cure malaria, Trump imposed to the FDA the use of this life-saving drug on US infected patients. Medias didn’t have any choice but to start talking about it, which ignited a chain reaction: big pharmas CEO’s were fired because they had just lost the vaccine contract, countries like Canada looked like genocidal fools for not using the cheap and inoffensive medication, while a most outrageous criminal act by a government was exposed in full light: the Macron government had proclaimed in January 2020 that chloroquine was harmful and had restrained its use, just a couple of weeks before the burst of the fake pandemic! Russian roulette is a popular game in Western governments these days around.

Russia announced its own corona-killing brew

On Saturday March 28th, Russia announced its own corona-killing brew, based on Dr Raoult’s magic potion. Yet another Cossack blow, this time to the big pharmas jugular vein, while most Western countries now have to implement the good doctor’s treatment, or face the slap of a Russian pill coming to save its citizen. Putin is in the lifesaving business these days: in the last week of March, he sent 15 military planes filled with doctors and supplies directly to North Italy, after an aid plane from China was blocked by the Czech Republic. We’re about to learn that European countries fear that China or Russia finds the truth in the Lombardy region, where people are not dying from some corona bug, but probably from a deadly cocktail hybrid from two earlier vaccines for meningitis and influenza, that they were injected in separate vaccination campaigns.

The punchline
I said earlier that everyday brings amazing news. Well on Sunday March 29th, the most stunning of them all fell like a ton of bricks on social medias: confined onlookers learned that Trump had taken control over the Federal Reserve, that is now handled by two representatives of the Treasury of State. Of all the crazy news within the last month, this is by far the best and most shocking. After three years in power, Trump has finally fulfilled his electoral promise of taking private banks out of the US public affairs, ending a century of exploitation of the American citizens. He has put the infamous Blackrock investment group to start buying important corporations for the Fed, meaning that he’s nationalizing chunks of the economy, while avoiding the crash of the market by implicating important private investors in the deal.

Trump and Powell
President Donald Trump gestures with Jerome Powell, his nominee to become chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 2, 2017
This outmost daring move comes at a crucial point in time, and faces us with the realization that Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump are united and have taken humanity to the crossroads of the New World Order and freedom. As I have stated often before, I thought that the world would deeply change between 2020 and 2024, because these would be the last 4 years of these two heroes in political power of their nations.

The New World Order is facing the two most powerful countries on the planet, and this fake pandemic changed everything. It showed how desperate the banksters are, and if we don’t want to end up with nuclear warheads flying in both directions, Putin and Trump have to stop them now.

Terminate the BIS, the World Bank, the IMF, the European Central bank, the EU, NATO, now. Our world won’t be perfect, but it might get much better soon.

194,Dr. Blaylock: Face Masks Pose Serious Risks to the Healthy,Dr Russel Blaylock,"With the advent of the so-called COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. One of these measures is the wearing of facial masks, either a surgical-type mask, bandana or N95 respirator mask. When this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior, it was assumed that it would behave, in terms of spread among communities, like other respiratory viruses. Little has presented itself after intense study of this virus and its behavior to change this perception.

This is somewhat of an unusual virus in that for the vast majority of people infected by the virus, one experiences either no illness (asymptomatic) or very little sickness. Only a very small number of people are at risk of a potentially serious outcome from the infection--mainly those with underlying serious medical conditions in conjunction with advanced age and frailty, those with immune compromising conditions and nursing home patients near the end of their lives. There is growing evidence that the treatment protocol issued to treating doctors by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mainly intubation and use of a ventilator (respirator), may have contributed significantly to the high death rate in these select individuals.

By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.

Russell Blaylock, MD

As for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, ""None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.""1   Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission.

It is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history.

Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications.

There is a difference between the N95 respirator mask and the surgical mask (cloth or paper mask) in terms of side effects. The N95 mask, which filters out 95% of particles with a median diameter >0.3 µm2 , because it impairs respiratory exchange (breathing) to a greater degree than a soft mask, and is more often associated with headaches. In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers (47 males and 165 females) asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches.2

They found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation (hypoxia) or an elevation in blood C02 (hypercapnia). It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death.

A more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask.3   Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance.

Unfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind--which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung.

While most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well. In this study, researchers examined the blood oxygen levels in 53 surgeons using an oximeter. They measured blood oxygenation before surgery as well as at the end of surgeries.4 The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels (pa02) significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels.

The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.5,6,7

People with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers.8,9  Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular (strokes) diseases.10

There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number.

It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain.11,12 In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.13

It is evident from this review that there is insufficient evidence that wearing a mask of any kind can have a significant impact in preventing the spread of this virus. The fact that this virus is a relatively benign infection for the vast majority of the population and that most of the at-risk group also survive, from an infectious disease and epidemiological standpoint, by letting the virus spread through the healthier population we will reach a herd immunity level rather quickly that will end this pandemic quickly and prevent a return next winter. During this time, we need to protect the at-risk population by avoiding close contact, boosting their immunity with compounds that boost cellular immunity and in general, care for them.

One should not attack and insult those who have chosen not to wear a mask, as these studies suggest that is the wise choice to make.",1,
219,“Globalized Wellness”: The Big Pharma COVID Vaccine Marathon,Brett Jordan,"Despite serious concern as this coming from a veteran virologist such as Jiang back in March (which, in our current COVID culture, might as well be a hundred years ago), it does appear that the die has now been cast in terms of pharmaceutical companies’ expectations about when a vaccine could appear on the market – never mind asking the question of whether it even should appear in the first place.  The expectation is official and companies want to deliver it yesterday.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla announced that “the short, less than four-month time frame in which we’ve been able to move from preclinical studies to human testing is extraordinary.”  Bloomberg reports that, across the board, “drugmakers have been working with regulators to compress development times to stop the spread of the virus…”

Incidentally, Pfizer’s shares were seen to rise by 2.2% shortly after releasing their news about potential early vaccination options.

Bloomberg warns, however, that “given what has happened with the development of other vaccines in the past, there is a risk that the new inoculation could actually make patients more susceptible to severe illness.”  As for specific time-frame, Pfizer has projected the fall of 2020 as an intended target period for emergency use of their vaccine. Currently, the company is working on four different potential products – each of which are based on a “new type of RNA technology.”

Specifically, upon injection into the body, the RNA (ribonucleic acid) inserts itself into human cells, which results in the formation of viral proteins that ultimately trigger the development of protective antibodies.

The only problem with this technology is that it has not actually been approved yet.

NYU Langone Vaccine Center director Mark Mulligan has pointed out that this type of vaccine technology that Pfizer is using is actually more of a “mimic of what happens with a natural immune response to an invader,” and that there are some definite advantages to such a vaccine product “in terms of the speed with which they can be produced and this idea that this is a natural type of vaccination” (Bloomberg, May 5).

Alternatively, the Saturday Evening Post recently revealed a major push towards a vaccine that is built specifically upon synthetic biology – the advantage being that such a product can be rolled out in mass quantities much sooner.  “To create new vaccines, researchers are using computers to design nanoparticles that self-assemble from protein building-blocks, LEGO-like, and attach viral molecules that trigger a strong immune response” (Saturday Evening Post, June 2020, Vol. 292).

An additional (so-called) benefit of this alternative brand of vaccine technology is that, once developed, it will not require refrigeration.  Naturally, this has considerable implications for wide-spread use in third world countries.  Unsurprisingly, funding for this emerging variation of vaccine technology is coming from the NIH as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

It goes without saying that pharmaceutical companies have become so infused into our globalized wellness infrastructure to the point that we don’t even see them anymore. They have become pervasively entrenched into the background of our social fabric, and are considered as mundanely-important and essential as the plumbing in our houses and our cities. This widespread habituation has ultimately numbed our sense of collective concern to the point where we aren’t as alarmed by how their products are conceived, nor by who is ultimately funding their research and development.  Their deeper, inner-workings are not a part of our personal lives, so why should we care?

When paired with the official COVID-19 narrative itself and the insidious scare-tactics that are being paraded by ill-informed public servants and the mainstream media, it is safe to say that we have officially entered into an age of radicalized and globalized med-seeking.  The intended consumers are those who don’t question the risks, the side-effects, or the injuries that are possible under such sped-up industrialized conditions; it is for those who simply want the promise of a cure for something which they blindly perceive to be a biological monstrosity.

The frightening thing about it is that so many citizens are just going along with it, no questions asked.  And if you do ask questions about it, then be prepared to be instantly dismissed as having no valid perspective, and your perspectives chalked up to the ramblings of a ‘tinfoil hat-wearing’ conspiracy theorist.

But my overall urge is to consider that this unusual and fascinating event in our history can actually serve as a very poignant stimulant in turning our attention back to the critical issue of freedom. 

After all, this really is the most important things that we can share as a global society.  Without it, I would argue that we ultimately don’t even have a society.

With this in mind, we can actually look to the blatantly-admitted foregoing of safety policies that are being employed by our drug providers, and do our fellow neighbours a true public service by simply not being okay with such irresponsible standards.

Furthermore, our collective resistance to such sociopathic medicating should ultimately serve as the newstandard – in contrast with what we are endlessly being offered as the “new normal.”  Otherwise, by silently and willingly accepting the desperate, profit-driven standards behind such ramped-up vaccine developments in the world today, we are telling the developers and funders behind such things that our bodies (along with our intellectual integrity for that matter) are essentially for sale.",1,
489,"'Captain Tom', 99, to help open hospital after raising $29 million - Reuters",,"LONDON (Reuters) - Captain Tom Moore, a 99-year-old British war veteran who has raised more than $29 million for the health service by walking 100 laps of his garden, will be a guest of honour at the opening of a new field hospital next week. Moore will praise National Health Service (NHS) workers via video link at the opening of a new â€œNightingaleâ€ hospital in Harrogate, northern England, which is being set up to help deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The World War Two veteran, who completed his challenge on Thursday, had raised 23.35 million pounds ($29.21 million) by 1606 GMT on Saturday. Moore said he was honoured to be opening the hospital and to have the chance to thank NHS workers directly. â€œI am still amazed by the amount of kindness and generosity from the UK public who continue to give despite it being an uncertain time for many,â€ Moore said in a statement. â€œI think the amount raised demonstrates just how much we all value the dedication and sacrifices made by our NHS workers. I have fought during a war and they are now fighting in a war too.â€ The retired army captain, who has used a walking frame with wheels since breaking his hip, set himself the target of walking the 25 metres around his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday on April 30. His original target was 1,000 pounds, but that modest aim as blown away as media attention from around the globe zoomed in on his garden in Bedfordshire, central England. He is in the running to be Britainâ€™s â€œSports Personality of the Yearâ€ and has been hailed as an â€œabsolute legendâ€ by Queen Elizabethâ€™s grandson, Prince William. He has said the walk was inspired by the care he received from Britainâ€™s state-run National Health Service when he broke his hip and when he was treated for cancer. â€œOn behalf of the NHS our heartfelt thanks go to Captain Tom Moore for his remarkable fundraising efforts for NHS charities, and to the public for their generosity in supporting him and our staff,â€ Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive, said. â€œInviting Captain Moore to be our guest of honour at the opening of NHS Nightingale Yorkshire and Humber is the least we can do to thank him for his inspiring service and example, and no doubt there will be further ways in which we will be able to express our gratitude.â€ Reporting by William James and Alistair Smout; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Ros Russell",0,
80,George Soros Groups Order Dems to Secure Healthcare for Illegals While Everyone Is Distracted By Coronavirus,Baxter Dmitry,"George Soros-funded groups have instructed the Democrats to use the coronavirus crisis to make radical changes to American society, including taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal aliens.  coalition of progressive groups, many funded by far-left billionaire Soros, is demanding Congress use the next COVID-19 stimulus package — intended to help Americans struggling due to the pandemic — to achieve a wishlist of leftist goals.

Breitbart report: The groups are sponsoring a “People’s Bailout” community organizing outfit to put pressure on lawmakers to use the crisis to enact reforms that would fundamentally transform American society.

The newly-created People’s Bailout group is demanding that the next coronavirus relief package adheres to “five principles.”

According to the group, the principles are endorsed by “nearly 1,000 organizations, unions, and community leaders, and nearly 100 members of Congress.” Those “principals” include far-left wish list items such as taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal aliens, a $15 per hour minimum wage, and government regulation of private companies’ directors to ensure “worker representation.”

Also within the “five principles” list are “direct sizable cash payments to every person” and the use of stimulus legislation to push what would amount to a massive “green” new deal, according to Breitbart.The “green” section calls for public funds to (below are direct quotes):

expand wind and solar power
build clean and affordable publictransit
weatherize our buildings
manufacture more clean energy goods
expand public services that support climate resilience
[reduce] climate emissions and toxic pollution.
Using progressive keywords, the group exclaims that a “people’s bailout should be rooted in justice” and “we demand the bailout provide a just recovery.”

The group is pushing the #PeoplesBailout hashtag and has gone so far as to provide activists with wording to use in social media posts directed at lawmakers. 

The group’s website also provides exact scripting for people to read when calling their lawmakers to demand the “five principles” be incorporated in stimulus legislation.

The People’s Bailout held an online May Day rally and now wants activists to get further involved by displaying banners and forming car caravans.

The website promotes a “helpful slideshow and handout on key tactics to use” to push promote the transformative agenda.

The “helpful slideshow” and “tactics” linked on the site are from the Ruckus Society, which specializes in the disruption tactic of so-called direct action.

Ruckus provided training and resources to the Occupy movement.It’s been funded by the Soros-fiAnonymousced Tides Foundation.

Ruckus leaders infamously helped to spark the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle that turned violent.

The Occupy-Ruckus link is instructive. Besides Ruckus, Occupy was also backed by groups like MoveOn.org and the Working Families Party.

The Soros-funded MoveOn.org and the Working Families Party are two of 13 listed “sponsors” of the People’s Bailout group.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, one People’s Bailout sponsor is the Sunrise Movement which helped craft the socialist utopian Green New Deal blueprint introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Sunrise was in part inspired by the activism of Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and the radical immigration group United We Dream.

Another sponsor is the Indivisible Project, which has partnered with Organizing for Action, the activist group that morphed from Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign.  Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups fiAnonymousced by Soros.

Indivisible yesterday endorsed Joe Biden for president. The group’s leaders say they are engaged with Biden’s campaign on such policies as universal voting by mail.

The other 13 sponsors of the People’s Bailout include the Center for Popular Democracy, Climate Justice Alliance, Greenpeace and the Soros-funded Sierra Club.

The People’s Bailout also boasts over 1,000 “signatories” which reads like a who’s who of far-left activist groups, including a large number of groups funded by Soros as well as the Soros-fiAnonymousced Tides Foundation.

The People’s Bailout is not alone. Many of the same far-left, Big Government proposals are also being peddled by other influential progressive organizations for Democrats to include in the next round of emergency stimulus funding, which the groups say should be at least as large as the $2.2 trillion CARES Act.

The Center for American Progress (CAP), which functions as an idea factory for the Democratic Party, compiled its own wish list for the next round of recovery legislation.

Like the People’s Bailout, CAP wants those defined as essential workers to get paid minimum wages of at least $15 dollars and they must have the ability to join a union.

Progressives have long pushed minimum wage hikes despite warnings that such proposals could lead to disastrous economic consequences.

The federal minimum wage hike is a progressive plan that in the past was marketed as a “living wage.” The living wage scheme, deployed in the past locally, has a history of hurting small businesses, negatively impacting local economies and decreasing employment opportunities for low income workers. Indeed, the living wage has monumentally failed during numerous high profile trials.

Increased abortion funding, stimulus checks for illegals, permanent housing guarantees, mail-in voting for elections and more union access also make their way into the CAP proposals.",1,
68,COVID-19: A US Scheme for Greater Consolidation of Wealth and Power?,Stephen Lendman,"Earlier global crises were manufactured to enhance the power of US ruling authorities, serve corporate favorites, and transfer wealth from ordinary people to privileged ones.

Since the neoliberal 1990s alone, that’s what the 1997-98 Asian fiAnonymouscial crisis, 2000 dot.com bust, and 2008-09 fiAnonymouscial crisis were all about.

Is that what’s behind COVID-19 fear-mongering, lockdowns, and market turmoil? Are things not what they seem?

If past is prologue, what was manufactured before appears to be happening again — establishment media playing a key roll as before by scaring the public to death.

While great care needs to be taken to prevent a highly infectious disease like COVID-19 from spreading, public angst generated by fear-mongering suggests motives other than protecting public health are in play.

Notably since the neoliberal 90s, US-led Western governments, in cahoots with corporate favorites, consolidated greater power and transferred enormous wealth from ordinary people to privileged interests.

For decades, monied interests never had things better, profiting hugely from market manipulated casino capitalism — at the expense of the public welfare.

Since the 2008-09 Wall Street orchestrated fiAnonymouscial crisis, protracted Depression conditions adversely affected ordinary people in the US and elsewhere.

Poverty, unemployment, underemployment, homelessness, food insecurity, hunger, overall deprivation and human suffering are growth industries in the US and West.

While Washington spends unlimited trillions of dollars for militarism, forever wars, and homeland security to protect privileged interests from nonbelievers, vital popular needs to health and welfare increasingly go begging.

The world’s richest country doesn’t give a hoot about the vast majority of its people, just its privileged class.

Class warfare pits private wealth against public health and welfare. For decades in the US, wages haven’t kept pace with inflation. Benefits steadily eroded.

High-paying jobs with good benefits disappeared by offshoring to low-wage countries. Improved technology forced wage earners to work harder for less. So-called free markets work only for elements that control them. See below.

Powerful interests benefit from class struggle by exploiting ordinary people with bipartisan support from Washington.

Instead of goverAnonymousce of, by, and for everyone equitably, only the privileged few are served.

Until the late 1970s in America, new generations were better off fiAnonymouscially than previous ones — no longer by institutionalized inequality.

The notion that markets move randomly is pure fiction. They’re manipulated up and down to serve monied interests.

Schemes include pumping and dumping, naked short-selling, precious metals price suppression, illegally profiting from inside information unavailable to the public, and government/Fed intervention to serve privileged interests at the expense of the public welfare.

Banks and other corporate favorites get bailouts, ordinary people sold out by their ruling authorities.

In cahoots with government, powerful private interests create fiAnonymouscial shocks to eliminate competition and consolidate to greater size and power by buying damaged assets cheap.

FiAnonymouscial history in the US and elsewhere has numerous examples of preying on the weak, crushing competition, socializing risks, privatizing profits, and redistributing wealth upward to a fiAnonymouscial oligarchy, creating tollbooth economies in debt bondage, getting what Michael Hudson calls a “free lunch” for privileged interests at the public’s expense.

When foxes guard the henhouse, new ways are invented to get a “free lunch” by creating crises for greater consolidation of wealth and power.

Orwell might have put it this way. At times like now, instability is stability, creating systemic risk is containing it, sloping playing fields are level ones, extracting maximum profit is sharing it, and what benefits the few helps everyone.

Market collapses can be hugely profitable for powerful insiders.

Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulators created an environment that serves speculation through futures, options, index funds, derivative securities, and short-selling, etc.

At times like now, greater concentration of wealth and power can be achieved at the expense of savers, seniors,  other ordinary people, and personal freedoms.

The road to tyranny is paved with ill-intentions. It’s happening in the US, West, and elsewhere in plain sight.

A Final Comment

Michael Hudson explained that lockdowns, social distancing, mass layoffs, crashing markets, and corporate bailouts “threat(en) a (global) depression,” adding:

History shows “it doesn’t have to be this way.” Hudson’s solution is “a debt jubilee…(R)estore…balance (by) slate-cleaning…”

“(W)hen debts grow too large to be paid without reducing debtors to poverty, the way to hold society together and restore balance is simply to cancel the bad debts.”

Extraordinary times call for extraordinary actions. Ones taken by America’s oligarchy benefit privileged interests exclusively at the expense of most others.

This time is highly likely to be no different than earlier in the US.

Hard times are likely to get much harder for ordinary Americans while favored interests benefit greatly from what’s going on. ",1,
16,NYC Man Drops Dead In Middle Of Street – Suspected Coronavirus! [VIDEO],Anonymous,"An Asian man wearing a surgical mask passed out yesterday in the middle of a crowded street in Queens. The man was rushed to the hospital, where according to social media reports, he is believed to have died. The man’s cause of death has not yet been determined, but plenty of people suspect that he may have died of the coronavirus. The incident occurred in Flushing Queens, an area of the city filled with Chinese immigrants. According to reports, a man was walking down the street, when he was suddenly overcome with a bought of coughing. He collapsed onto the floor, and after a few seconds, he stopped moving. As the video shows, officers quickly arrived on the scene, but seemed unwilling to physically assist the man, perhaps out of fear. Unfortunately, New York City has been facing a rise in racism against Asian Americans since the outbreak of the coronavirus.",1,
84,Did scientists know about coronavirus before outbreak? 'Disease X' warning revealed,CHARLIE BRADLEY,"CORONAVIRUS chaos appeared to come out of the blue as the illness has swiftly impacted countries all over the world. However, it has emerged that scientists warned about a new deadly virus long ago, deeming it a remote threat at the time and dubbing it ""Disease X"". The World Health Organisation released a report in 2017 in which various pathogens that posed a risk and needed addressing were listed. Featuring among the threats were Nipah disease, which causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). The list was comprised of viruses which had no known treatments or vaccines, and all had the potential to trigger pandemics that could kill thousands – just as Ebola and swine flu did in previous years. But later on, a new illness was added: Disease X. The mysterious name referred to “a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown”. It added that humanity should now be working to seek out and tackle unknown diseases, but assumed they would remain a remote threat for some time. The recent outbreak of coronavirus – known as Covid-19 – bears similarities to the description of Disease X and suggests that researchers underestimated the danger of an enigmatic virus they the likes they warned of three years earlier. As the NHS highlights, coronavirus' main symptoms include a cough, a high temperature and shortness of breath. While scientists have been able to flag various illnesses as potential threats, some have argued that the research has been negligent in some areas, allowing the coronavirus breakout to occur under the radar. Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust said: “World health authorities have spent a lot of time and money making plans for dealing with the next major outbreak, which was assumed would be an influenza pandemic. A lot of investment has gone into making influenza vaccines, for example. “But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don’t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.",1,
248,"BREAKING: Coronavirus Hits 15% Fatality Rate, 83% Infection Rate for Those Exposed; Lancet Publishes Early Study That Points to Alarming Consequences for Humanity",Mike Adams,"BREAKING: The U.S. news media is currently running about one to two days behind the Chinese media in covering the bombshell revelations surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. Natural News has Chinese-speaking investigators on the ground in Taiwan, and they’re scanning the Chinese media for the most important announcements.
Earlier today, the Taiwan media began reporting on a new mainland Chinese study that specifically looked at the individuals involved in this Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. We have a partial translation and link below. According to this news, which is widely circulating in the Taiwan press and is based on a study published in The Lancet, the Wuhan coronavirus fatality rate has leaped to 15%, and the infection rate among those exposed is 83%.
These numbers are virtually unheard of in the world of microbiology and infectious disease transmission. It means that 15 out of every 100 infected people will die. It also means that 83 out of 100 exposed people will become infected and able to transmit the disease to others.
So for every 100 people who are exposed, around 12 will die (15% of 83). The only criticism of this study is that its sample size was relatively small, given that it’s still very early in the outbreak of this disease. The study looked at 41 cases of individuals who were exposed.
If the infection rate stands at 83%, this pandemic will be impossible to contain
The story is from TaiwanDaily.net and says this (translated):
Hong Kong and Chinese researchers published the latest research on “New Coronavirus 2019” (referred to as “Wuhan pneumonia”) in the medical journal “Lancet” on the 24th. Chinese experts pointed directly to the disease. The [fatality] rate is fifteen percent. Hong Kong experts confirmed for the first time that Wuhan pneumonia can be transmitted from person to person, and patients may not have surface symptoms. Taking a Shenzhen seven-person home with six people as an example, the analysis shows that the attack rate is as high as 83% and the incubation period is three to six days It is expected that a large number of cases will break out in China within a week, and the next two weeks will be a crucial period to prevent any place from becoming “another Wuhan”.",1,
35,"Black cats turned into paste, sold as coronavirus remedy in Vietnam",Yaron Steinbuch,"It’s very bad luck to be a black cat in Vietnam, where the poor animals are being killed and eaten amid rumors their ground-up bodies can treat the coronavirus, animal rights activists said.
The No to Dog Meat charity said the black felines are boiled, skinned and cooked before being turned into paste and sold as medicine to fight COVID-19, according to South West News Service. The gruesome and barbaric practice is centered around the city of Hanoi, but the concoction also is being sold online, the news outlet reported.
One stomach-churning image purportedly shows the mixture being fed to a baby.
Horrific video obtained by the group shows rows of dead cats drying in the sun after being slaughtered, as well as a live cat being boiled.
Charity founder Julia de Cadenet said the footage made her blood curdle.
“People all over the world are understandably terrified of COVID-19, but this does not excuse the horrific cruelty that Vietnamese people are inflicting on these poor cats,” she said.
“There is no evidence whatsoever that eating cats cures coronavirus, and even if there was, this inhumane treatment is a level of cruelty that is unacceptable even for those who eat meat,” de Cadenet continued.
“In China, when the virus first broke, rumors flew around that pets could spread the disease. This led to many people and the authorities rounding up animals and killing them,” she said.
“Our human fears about this pandemic should not be used as an excuse to treat defenseless animals who look to us for protection, with utter contempt.” The campaigner has warned both the UK and the UN that unsanitary meat production, such as the dog and cat meat trade, could spark a global health crisis.
“They recognize that live slaughter of animals in markets is particularly unsanitary and that human consumption of wildlife and endangered species must end,” she said.
“China recently banned eating wildlife and formally recognized dogs and cats as pets, not food, but more needs to be done throughout Asia,” de Cadenet added.
“In Vietnam and Indonesia, the practice of eating dogs and cats and exotic wildlife is still highly prevalent. Traders have been promoting ‘exotic’ meats as a cure to coronavirus.",1,

More than 70 UK nationals stuck onboard a Japan cruise ship infected by the Coronavirus will be evacuated. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed this morning that it is ""working to organise"" a flight back to the UK for British nationals. A Number 10 spokesman announced that Brits currently quarantined on board the Diamond Princess, were being contacted about the possibility of a repatriation flight in a statement yesterday. The news comes after a British citizen trapped onboard the vessel spoke out, saying they felt â€˜forgottenâ€™ by the UK Government.   Pressure has been mounting over the past few days for the FCO to take action. Brits have been calling for the FCO to fly home the 74 Britons on the Diamond Princess after the US chartered two planes and repatriated 340 of its citizens. Canada, South Korea, Hong Kong and Italy have already announced flights home for their citizens and residents. On Monday, the Japanese Health Ministry confirmed 99 more people on board have been diagnosed with the illness, bringing the total to 454.

The star responded to a Twitter appeal from trapped citizens David and Sally Abel. The terrified couple asked the British businessman to charter a special plane to rescue the stranded Brits. In an interview with Channel 4 news, David Abel began to lash out at the UK Government for failing to provide them with means to return home.  He said he felt abandoned by the UK Government whilst he saw many Americans being flown back home on Sunday. Speaking to Channel 4 News, he said: â€œItâ€™s making it worse seeing all the countries coming alongside their people and taking them home. â€œPutting them into quarantine in their homeland.â€ The couple's son Steve Abel renewed appeals for the Government to help his parents, who he fears may become separated in Japan.

And it would also mean that the severe measures, justified or not, are a sort of large-scale “sociological experiment” which aims to see how much repression would people be willing to accept, for a vague justification, and how politicized could the entire situation be. It could potentially also show how far people can be pushed before there’s riots on the streets, and the lack of “entertainment” leads to people finding ways to “entertain” themselves. As it has been proven time and again, mob mentality dictates that “entertainment” usually means decapitating the elite.",1,

79,The President of Madagascar Quits World Health Organization & Urges Other African Nations To Leave Too,Niamh Harris,"The President of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina has called on all African countries to quit the World Health Organization (WHO) amid a growing demand for a covid -19 herbal remedy. Rajoelina announced last month that scientists from the country’s research institute had developed Covid Organics, or CVO, to treat the coronavirus.

The president said CVO is made from the artemisia and other local plants. The herb is a source of artemisinin, a significant component of modern antimalarials, and the plant has been the subject of Western studies looking at potential coronavirus treatments.

But the World Health Organization has warned against any self-medication and said that it has not recommended to be used as a cure for the COVID-19.

Celeysylv reports: The Malagasy president says, Europe created organizations with the desire for Africans to remain dependent on them. Africa has found a medicine against Coronavirus but Europe thinks they have a monopoly of intelligence as such they are refusing to acknowledge it. It is against this backdrop that I invite all African Nations to quit the international organizations in order for us to build ours. Rajoelina has put his reputation and credibility on the line touting the medicine as a cure. He said it cures COVID-19 in 10 days.

“No one will stop us from moving forward – not a country, not an organisation,” Rajoelina said in response to the WHO’s concerns.

He said the proof of the tonic’s efficacy was in the “healing” of “our patients”.

He called the medicine a “preventive and curative remedy”.

Rajoelina said Madagascar till date, has reported 212 coronavirus infections and 107 recoveries.

The country has one critical case, but no death.

“The patients who have healed have taken no other product than Covid-Organics,” the president said, adding that his country has a history of traditional medicine.

“What if this remedy had been discovered by a European country, instead of Madagascar?”, Rajoelina queried WHO and other skeptics.

“Would people doubt it so much? I don’t think so,” Rajoelina told FRANCE 24 and RFI .

The drink is derived from artemisia – a plant with proven anti-malarial properties – and other indigenous herbs.

“What is the problem with Covid-Organics, really?, he said.

“Could it be that this product comes from Africa?

“Could it be that it’s not OK for a country like Madagascar, which is the 63rd poorest country in the world… to have come up with (this formula) that can help save the world?” asked Rajoelina.

My country Madagascar leaves all the organizations tonight and I call on other African Nations to do same.",1,
207,Is the media TRYING to spread the coronavirus?,Ethan Huff,"For months, the mainstream media has been pretending as though it desperately wants to save lives by combating the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) through any means necessary. But once President Donald Trump actually presented a promising solution, they all flipped a switch nearly in unison.

According to Attorney General William Barr, news coverage about the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine quickly shifted the moment Trump endorsed its usage, even though Dr. Anthony Fauci himself endorsed the drug back in 2013 during the Obama years when it was used to treat SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), two “cousins” of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“Before the president said anything about it, there was fair and balanced coverage of this very promising drug and the fact that it had such a long track record that the risks were pretty well-known, and as soon as he said something positive about it, the media has been on a jihad to discredit the drug,” Barr is quoted as saying.

“It’s quite strange,” he added. “The stridency of the partisan attacks on him has gotten higher and higher, and it’s gotten disappointing to see.”

What could be the key to quickly getting everyone out of lockdown and back to normal is being vilified by Fauci, the media, and other anti-Trump elements that, in many ways, seem to want the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to continue spreading. After all, if they really wanted to stop this scourge, then they’d be supportive of any possible solution, regardless of who presents it. Describing hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer” in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), President Trump’s recent announcement appeared to shock many deep state hacks who were clearly planning to unveil mandatory vaccinations as the “solution,” not some generic pharmaceutical that won’t make any of them rich. This is presumably why he’s now under attack both by the mouthpieces of Operation Mockingbird and by leftovers in his administration such as Fauci.

Barr, at least, is thrilled that Trump made the announcement, also declaring his entire handling of the situation to be “statesmanlike.” On the other hand, Barr stated that the White House press corps has been asking a lot of “snarky gotcha questions” to try to derail his efforts.

Some in the media are claiming that Trump cited a “flawed” study out of France, which suggested that hydroxychloroquine may be effective against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). But this hasn’t phased Trump, who also recently announced that his administration had purchased “a tremendous amount” of the drug, which is to be distributed to the states following emergency approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The day before this, White House economic adviser Peter Navarro reportedly got into a heated argument with Fauci over the drug, which Fauci has been downplaying despite his previous endorsements while working under Obama. Fauci continues to claim that there exists no “strong” evidence to suggest that hydroxychloroquine works for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and that it shouldn’t be prescribed because of this.

“Day by day there are more articles about the success of the drug in combination with some other drug,” wrote one Zero Hedge commenter about the news.

“Yes, it may have side effects but it has been in use since 1955 … I am not aware of one article that has spoken about how this drug has failed.”",1,
128,Kudos To Louisiana State Rep. Abramson For Introducing House Resolution 145 “To Study The Environmental And Health Effects Of Evolving 5G Technology And Report Its Findings”,CATHERINE FROMPOVICH,"Well, well, well! It’s happening: The push to learn the hazards threatening human health and the environment from 5G cellular network technology by StateRepresentative, Neil C. Abramson. Democrat, District 98 (Orleans Parish, New Orleans).

How lucky are those living in that state to have a legislator who “gets it” regarding the fact no health or environmental hazards/adverse effects fromINDEPENDENT SCIENCE STUDIES have been performed regarding fifth generation microwave technology (5G) currently being forced dogmatically—similar to mandatory vaccines enforcement—on to consumers, who have absolutely no idea what is about to befall them, their children, pets, an over-stressed environmentincluding tech’s anti-natural workings compromising “Mother Nature,” i.e., weather geoengineering. Can/will 5G interfere with numerous high technologies, e.g., HAARPand spy satellites?

How will 5G beaming down from satellites ‘perched’ above Earth; transmitting from poles outside bedroom windows or small cell towers erected anywhere, including your back yard which you cannot protest nor remove, affect your ability to perform cognitively, all while malfunctioning, or suffering, from “electrosmog” at its super-charged RF energy transmissions?
As with previous generations, 5G is dependent on spectrum in many different bands. The three 5G ranges are: Sub-1 GHz, 1-6 GHz and above 6 GHz. The 26 GHz and 28 GHz bands fall in the latter group. However, the actual 5G communication range is being offered in the millimeter wave length, i.e., 5G Ultra Wideband 24 GHz and above.

Since 5G is a “given and known weaponized military microwave genre,” not just a communications technology, shouldn’t the public have access to the military’s research? Why did the military choose to ‘share’ 5G with microwave industry corporations? Is there more to it than just “business as usual,” e.g., complete control and surveillance, all while promoting 5G as “better and much faster tech”?

LouisiaAnonymouss certainly want to know “what 5G communication RFs do,” so they are asking for research and facts, something every state also should be engaged in soliciting. Below is the Louisiana House Resolution in the current 2019 Regular Session.",1,
63,COVID-19: An Ocean of Fears and Lies,Dr. Pascal Sacré,"“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.” – Lao Tzu

Are you too waiting for the second wave?

What type of waves are we talking about?

Your eyes are riveted perhaps on a multifaceted agent called Covid-19 [1] and you hear that this agent will be coming back every year, or even several times a year.

Personally, I am more afraid of waves of panic, and downpours of fears and lies inflicted on us every year, even several times a year.

Your minds are fed with various of fears and contradictory measures, sometimes as absurd as forcing thirteen-year-old children to wear face masks.

It is not surprising that people of all walks of life, nationalities and cultures are starting to lose faith in what they are told.

We hear ad nauseam the alternative voices being called ‘conspirational’ by the ‘official’ commercially sponsored media.

Among those accused of promoting ‘conspiracy theories’, we find university professors, serious scientists, level-headed researchers and highly qualified doctors.

These persons have a proven track record of seriously done work.

They are reliable. They can be trusted.

In fact, as soon as you deviate even so slightly from the official line, you are called a conspiratorialist spreader of dangerous disinformation, a conspiracy theorist, or more simply, an unreasonable person. Yes, idiot.

Fortunately, despite the insistence coming from some quarters to discredit any alternative to the official discourse, the people themselves are waking up. Citizens feel that something is amiss, and they are more and more losing confidence in the narrative of the ‘Ministry of Truth’.

Lie # 1: Hydroxychloroquine doesn’t work

Lie # 2: Hydroxychloroquine is too dangerous

Some countries use it with good results and without major side effects.

In countries where prescriptions have been banned outside hospitals, such as in France andBelgium, some field doctors have “disobeyed” and done what they thought was right, with good results and without major side effects.

Just imagine!

Qualified, experienced doctors, normally responsible and free to prescribe, prohibited from doing their job!

I refer you to my previous article (in French): Covid-19: And what now?  ( Covid-19: Et mainteAnonymoust?)

Beyond the controversy over the scientific merits of giving an inexpensive drug (that has been known and prescribed in huge amounts for more than 70 years) to infected and symptomatic people or people at risk (caregivers, residents of nursing homes or hospital patients), in a specific setting (cardiac monitoring, compliance with contraindications, dosages, earliness) and this without waiting a year or more for a “gold standard double blind randomized clinical control trial” which hasn’t even been scheduled yet, my question is:

Do the authorities, helped by the media, want to take away all hope from the people?

Any hope that could overshadow expensive, unknown and very profitable treatments for merchants who infiltrate all governments and health institutions, especially in France and Belgium [See my article: Covid-19: Check the Source of your Information!  War against…  Corruption?], but also throughout Europe, worldwide [Politics and Corruption at the World Health Organization (WHO …].

Let us be clear: any new vaccine, although it can bring huge benefits to the vaccine industry, is potentially dangerous for the vaccinated.

Any new drug is potentially dangerous, and for some, they are very expensive, especially those ending in –ab [2-3] and in -ir, like Remdesivir which already does a lot of good for the fiAnonymousces of the Gilead firm [4] despite proof of its ineffectiveness, as stated in the Economic Times site, on Apr 23 2020 [5].

These molecules are even more risky if they are prepared under special emergency authorizations, in haste, without respecting the standard steps of marketing authorization that every drug must follow, according to the very same rigorous procedures that university establishment requests loud and clear for hydroxychloroquine, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc…   maybe the next will be H2O…

Lie # 3: Do not look to food supplements such as ZINC, Vitamin C and Vitamin D

Let me make it simple so that everyone understands.

Our best ally against any aggressive pathogen, or any infection, is our immune system.

It is not the masks, the physical distance, nor the vaccines, but first and foremost our immune system in perfect good working order that will protect us.

Our immune system!

By analogy, this system is like the defense of a country, with its borders, its soldiers, its planes, its radars, its armored vehicles, its artillery, its snipers …

For all of the following statements, please refer to the footnotes.

Zinc [6], vitamin D [7], vitamin C are all three essential elements of our immune defense system.

These are ammunition, missiles, gasoline and body armor when you go to war.

Now read the following carefully:

Most populations are deficient in these three elements [8].

Our Health Authorities know this well.

For Zinc in particular, this deficiency affects populations precisely at risk of developing a serious form of COVID-19 (leading to intensive care, and death): the obese, diabetics and the elderly [9].

Not to supplement these populations in zinc, today, it would be like sending the soldiers of an army to go to the front without ammunition for their rifles, without gasoline in their armored vehicles.

In addition, intense and prolonged confinement resulted in under-exposure to the sun and lack of sunlight is aggravating the deficit of vitamin D, which is otherwise produced in the skin under the effect of by the sun’s rays. Sunlight also kills viruses in minutes, yet they tell us to hunker indoors.

What is more, such an excessive and prolonged lock-down has brought about a dropin physical activity and phenomenal level of stress, thus further diminishing the effectiveness of our immune systems [10-11], even more than it was before.

Findings from the outset!

Findings from research provide solid grounds for giving supplements of these three elements, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D to help the immune system fight coronavirus infections [12].

Side effects from these three time-tested nutrients are rare, and are easy for general practitioners to control [Read: It Is Not Only the COVID-19 Virus that Is Dangerous. It Is How Our …  ].

But, as expected, here in Belgium the Health Authorities disapprove of these potential natural treatments. “No multi-center, double-blind, peer-reviewed studies. ”

“No evidence of effectiveness. ”

“There is no clinical evidence. ”

Always the same screeds repeated ad nauseum to disqualify these inexpensive therapeutic avenues, devoid of side effects but that they are very unprofitable for anyone, except for the patient.

Above all, it is clinical common sense to admit that there is value in using these substances for any infectious disease and for COVID-19 more specifically, and also to trust general practitioners who know their job.

Lie # 4: “COVID-19” deaths are all due to “COVID-19”.

No!

This may be the hardest thing to believe.

However, no, the “COVID-19” counted deaths did not all die from the “COVID-19”.

Many reliable testimonies bear witness to the fact that the dead labelled “COVID-19” have not all died from that cause.

Especially in the old-peoples nursing homes that were under an authoritarian lock-down like in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy.

Thousands of frail and elderly people have died of loneliness, stress, physical inactivity, deficiencies in zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D, inability to move to eat and drink and receive love from their closest ones.

With or without COVID-19.

Thousands of people may have died or may have had to be hospitalized, threatened with the use of damaging respiratory ventilators, because they could not be treated by their general practitioners with drugs such as hydroxychloroquine.

Looking back at what was done with the benefit of perspective, could it even be that a large scale, planned euthanasia has been presented as the covid-19 pandemia?

I could have gone on listing the many more lies.

Other whistleblowers are doing that, and this story is not over.

For instead of this unleashed ocean of fears and lies, I suggest that we substitute it with a peaceful ocean of calm and common sense.

More and more people are starting to realize that something is wrong.

There will be a demand for accountability.  We will need to confine the mad captains that led us astray to these troubled waters to their cabins and take back control of our bodies and our minds.

Soon.

I have good hope we shall.",1,
481,Halliburton to 'significantly' cut 2020 capex below $1.2 billion budget - Reuters,Liz Hampton,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services firm Halliburton (HAL.N) is accelerating its cost-cutting and will significantly reduce spending this year below its original $1.2 billion budget, its finance chief said on Tuesday. The Houston, Texas-based company did not disclose a new spending target, but is testing scenarios including a 60-65% reduction in some areas of the oilfield services sector, Chief Financial Officer Lance Loeffler told investors on a webcast. He pointed to a reduction to $800 million done during the last downturn that began in late 2014 as a potential target. Crude oil prices have more than halved since the start of the year as the spread of coronavirus slashes demand, and after Russia and Saudi Arabia launched an unanticipated price war. On Tuesday, U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading at $23.72 a barrel. [O/R] â€œThe industry is facing an unprecedented dual impact on demand and supply side that none of us have witnessed over our professional lifetimes,â€ Loeffler told investors. Halliburton had already been cutting cost by idling equipment and laying off workers. Last week, it said it would furlough 3,500 workers for two months. â€œAll options are being considered,â€ Loeffler said. He emphasized that Halliburton would focus on returns and free cash flow, rather than slashing prices to gain or hold onto market share, as the company did in the last downturn. He said one reason Halliburton was taking a different strategy this time was because financing from Wall Street had dried up for the oil and gas industry. â€œThere is no more lifeline,â€ he said. Shares of Halliburton were up 24.4% on Tuesday to $6.52. They are down 72% from the beginning of the year. Reporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Marguerita Choy",0,
436,"How Shake Shack, Potbelly and Ruth's Chris got small-business loans",Greg Iacurci@GregIacurci,"Some big restaurant chains have gotten called out in recent days for using a loophole in the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief law to access loan money earmarked for smaller businesses. Potbelly Sandwich Shop, for example, got a $10 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program â€” the upper lending limit. Ruth's Chris Steak House got $10 million for each of two subsidiaries. And it's not just restaurants. Other large businesses like hotel operators and energy companies have gotten loans for millions of dollars, according to news reports. The $349 billion in program funding ran out on Thursday and left many small businesses shut out. ""There have been some people, some companies approved that I believe should not have been under the intent of the law,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, told CNBC on Monday. Hamburger restaurant chain Shake Shack is among the companies to have received a $10 million loan. Company executives subsequently said they would return the money so it could be reallocated to businesses in greater need. ""If this act were written for small businesses, how is it possible that so many independent restaurants whose employees needed just as much help were unable to receive funding?"" CEO Randy Garutti and founder Danny Meyer wrote in a blog post Monday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was ""glad to see"" Shake Shack returning its loan, according to a Tweet. Ruth's Chris and Potbelly didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. How were such companies able to get funding in the first place? The Paycheck Protection Program offers forgivable loans to business with 500 or fewer employees. Companies can secure loans of equal to 2Â½ times their monthly payroll, up to $10 million. The $349 billion program was created as part of the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package enacted last month. The law makes an exception for some companies â€” namely, those with a North American Industry Classification System code of 72, which covers businesses in the accommodation and food services industries. This is a broad category that includes hotels, motels, casino hotels and other travel accommodations, as well as restaurants, caterers, bars and others. Such businesses that have more than one physical location, but which don't employ more than 500 people per location, are eligible for loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, according to the coronavirus relief law. The law, known as the CARES Act, also has a carve-out for foreign-owned entities. A large foreign company with a U.S. subsidiary of 500 employees or fewer is also eligible for a loan covering its U.S. entity, said Christopher Maher, CEO of New Jersey-based community bank OceanFirst Financial. It makes sense to have a loophole for certain businesses, said Maher. Those with a franchise model, for example, operate like independent businesses, he said.

It could take months But it doesn't make as much sense to give funding to large corporate entities like Shake Shack that don't operate with franchises, he said. Large companies can raise money in the stock market and have other avenues available to them for loans, Maher said. The Federal Reserve, for example, recently announced a $600 billion Main Street lending program for mid-sized businesses. The carve-out for certain groups is a function of being asked to draft the CARES Act to ""cover as many people as possible,"" said Rubio, who also defended it. ""These hotels, they might say Marriott or Hyatt or Hilton, but it's actually owned by an individual,"" he said. ""And the same can happen with restaurants and franchises."" Some observers wonder why the accommodation and food services industries were singled out for relief in the CARES Act, and not others like health clubs with multiple geographic footprints. They also fear similar legislative language will apply to a new, $310 billion round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program that federal lawmakers could pass by mid-week. ""I think it would be prudent for it to change,"" Maher said. The Treasury Department and Small Business Administration, which oversee the program, didn't return a request for comment.",0,
78,Japanese TV report sparks speculations in China that Covid-19 may have originated in US,Global Times,"A report from a Japanese TV station that suspected some of the 14,000 Americans died of influenza may have unknowningly contracted the coronavirus has gone viral on Chinese social media, stoking fears and speculations in China that the novel coronavirus may have originated in the US.

The report, by TV Asahi Corporation of Japan, suggested that the US government may have failed to grasp how rampant the virus have gone on the US soil.

On February 14, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they will begin to test individuals with influenza-like-illness for the novel coronavirus at public health labs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City.

However, it is unknown whether Americans who have already died of the influenza had contracted the coronavirus, as reported by TV Asahi.

The story sparked various conspiracy theories on Chinese cyberspace.

The Military World Games were held in Wuhan in October. ""Perhaps the US delegates brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, and some mutation occurred to the virus, making it more deadly and contagious, and causing a widespread outbreak this year,"" a user posted on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo.

Shen Yi, an international relations professor at the Shanghai-based Fudan University, noted that global virologists are working to track the origin of the virus, including the intelligence agencies. Netizens are encouraged to actively partake in discussions, but preferrably in a rational fashion.

""The symptoms and the contagiosity of the COVID-19 are evident to all. It is impossible to conceal the origins of the disease,"" Shen said, urging the public to rely more on facts.

The epidemic is a major test for many systems and media should report in a clear and accurate manner. Asahi's report is actually using ambiguous Japanese expressions to lead readers to think that the COVID-19 is more serious than it appeared to be in the US, he added.

US officials have so far confirmed 35 cases of the novel coronavirus in the country.

Media reported the US CDC has been working with the healthcare sector to heighten preparedness before the virus ""take(s) a foothold in the US.""

Reuters quoted US health officials on Friday as saying, they are preparing for the possibility of the spread of the new coronavirus through US communities that would force closures of schools and businesses.

The US is concerned that a larger spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus could overwhelm emergency rooms, and cause supply shortages of some crucial medical supplies, during an already busy time dealing with seasonal flu that has resulted in the illness of between 9 to 45 million annually, since 2010.

310,Facebook to launch gaming app as amateur-friendly Twitch competitor,Alison Foreman,"Facebook is getting serious about gaming. On Sunday, The New York Times reported the social networking service would launch Facebook Gaming â€” a new mobile app dedicated to livestreaming video game content â€” via the Google Play store on April 20. (Yes, tomorrow.) The app will be free to download, devoid of ads for now, and only compatible with Android. An iOS rollout is expected soon, pending Apple's approval. Facebook did not immediately return Mashable's request for comment. ""Itâ€™s literally just a few clicks and then live, youâ€™re a streamer.â€ A competitor to sites like Twitch and YouTube, Facebook Gaming aims to capitalize on a growing community of amateur streamers by simplifying the user experience and harnessing the accessibility of mobile games. While Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook's existing gaming presence are predominantly PC focused, the mobile app's ""Go Live"" feature promises to speed up sharing. â€œThere are a lot of people who listen to music and say, â€˜I can imagine myself being a musician,â€™â€ Vivek Sharma, Facebookâ€™s vice president for gaming, told The New York Times. â€œPeople are watching streams and theyâ€™re like, â€˜I want to be a streamer,â€™ and with 'Go Live' itâ€™s literally just a few clicks and then live, youâ€™re a streamer.â€ Creators will be able to share livestreams to their personal Facebook pages â€” a tool particularly handy amidst social distancing measures â€” as well as play ""casual"" games included in the app. Per The New York Times, the increase in gaming popularity due to coronavirus motivated Facebook to accelerate the app's launch, initially planned for June. Over the past 18 months, Facebook Gaming has been tested in Southeast Asia and Latin America. To keep the app ad-free, Facebook allows users to give donations (aka ""stars"") to streamers they like. Facebook will then take a portion of the money, though they have yet to say how much. SEE ALSO: Best beginner-friendly video games for your coronavirus lockdown Though consoles (particularly, the Nintendo Switch) have seen a boom in recent weeks, Facebook maintains their focus on mobile gaming will pay off. â€œWe donâ€™t want to be the background window in a Chrome tab while someone is doing their homework or doing something else,â€ Sharma said to The New York times. â€œWith mobile, if you have the app open and youâ€™re using the app, itâ€™s in the foreground. You canâ€™t do anything else on your mobile phone, and that is extremely powerful.â€",0,
251,I’ve Signed Death Certificates During COVID-19. Here’s Why You Can’t Trust Any of the Statistics on the Number of Victims,Dr. Malcolm Kendrick,"As an NHS doctor, I’ve seen people die and be listed as a victim of coronavirus without ever being tested for it. But unless we have accurate data, we won’t know which has killed more: the disease or the lockdown? I suppose most people would be somewhat surprised to know that the cause of death, as written on death certificates, is often little more than an educated guess. Most people die when they are old, often over eighty. There is very rarely going to be a post-mortem carried out, which means that, as a doctor, you have a think about the patient’s symptoms in the last two weeks of life or so. You go back over the notes to look for existing medical conditions. Previous stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, angina, dementia and suchlike. Then you talk to the relatives and carers and try to find out what they saw. Did they struggle for breath, were they gradually going downhill, not eating or drinking? If I saw them in the last two weeks of life, what do I think was the most likely cause of death? There are, of course, other factors. Did they fall, did they break a leg and have an operation – in which case a post-mortem would more likely be carried out to find out if the operation was a cause.

Mostly, however, out in the community, death certification is certainly not an exact science. Never was, never will be. It’s true that things are somewhat more accurate in hospitals, where there are more tests and scans, and suchlike. Then, along comes Covid-19, and many of the rules – such as they were – went straight out the window. At one point, it was even suggested that relatives could fill in death certificates, if no-one else was available. Though I am not sure this ever happened. What were we now supposed to do? If an elderly person died in a care home, or at home, did they die of Covid-19? Well, frankly, who knows? Especially if they didn’t have a test for Covid-19 – which for several weeks was not even allowed. Only patients entering hospital were deemed worthy of a test. No-one else. What advice was given? It varied throughout the country, and from coroner to coroner – and from day to day. Was every person in a care home now to be diagnosed as dying of the coronavirus ? Well, that was certainly the advice given in several parts of the UK. Where I work, things were left more open. I discussed things with colleagues and there was very little consensus. I put Covid-19 on a couple of certificates, and not on a couple of others. Based on how the person seemed to die. I do know that other doctors put down Covid-19 on anyone who died from early March onwards. I didn’t. What can be made of the statistics created from data like these? And does it matter? It matters greatly for two main reasons. First, if we vastly overestimate deaths from Covid-19, we will greatly underestimate the harm caused by the lockdown. This issue was looked at in a recent article published in the BMJ, The British Medical Journal.  It stated: ""Only a third of the excess deaths seen in the community in England and Wales can be explained by Covid-19. …David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, said that Covid-19 did not explain the high number of deaths taking place in the community.” “At a briefing hosted by the Science Media Centre on May 12 he explained that, over the past five weeks, care homes and other community settings had had to deal with a ‘staggering burden’ of 30,000 more deaths than would normally be expected, as patients were moved out of hospitals that were anticipating high demand for beds. Of those 30,000, only 10 000 have had Covid-19 specified on the death certificate. While Spiegelhalter acknowledged that some of these ‘excess deaths’ might be the result of underdiagnosis, ‘the huge number of unexplained extra deaths in homes and care homes is extraordinary. When we look back . . . this rise in non-covid extra deaths outside the hospital is something I hope will be given really severe attention.’ He added that many of these deaths would be among people ‘who may well have lived longer if they had managed to get to hospital.’” What Speigelhalter is saying here is that people may well be dying ‘because of’ Covid, or rather, because of the lockdown. Because they are not going to hospital to be treated for conditions other than Covid. We know that A&E attendances have fallen by over fifty percent since lockdown. Admissions with chest pain have dropped by over fifty percent. Did these people just die at home? From my own perspective, I have certainly found it extremely difficult to get elderly patients admitted to hospital. I recently managed with one old chap who was found to have sepsis, not Covid-19. Had he died in the care home; he would almost certainly have been diagnosed as “dying of Covid.” The bottom line here is that, if we do not diagnose deaths accurately, we will never know how many died of Covid-19, or ‘because of’ the lockdown. Those supporting lockdown, and advising governments, can point to how deadly Covid was, and say we were right to do what we did. When it may have been that lockdown itself was just as deadly. Directing care away from everything else, to deal with a single condition. Keeping sick, ill, vulnerable people away from hospitals.

The other reason why having accurate statistics is vitally important is in planning for the future. We have to accurately know what happened this time, in order to plan for the next pandemic, which seems almost inevitable as the world grows more crowded. What are the benefits of lockdown, what are the harms? What should we do next time a deadly virus strikes?

If Covid-19 killed 30,000, and lockdown killed the other 30,000, then the lockdown was a complete and utter waste of time. And should never happen again. The great fear is that this would be a message this government does not want to hear – so they will do everything possible not to hear it.

It will be decreed that all the excess deaths we have seen this year were due to Covid-19. That escape route will be made far easier if no-one has any real idea who actually died of the coronavirus disease, and who did not. Yes, the data on Covid-19 deaths really matters.",1,

Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and Deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam will lead the vaccine taskforce. It comes as a total of 14,576 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Thursday, the Department of Health said, up by 847 from 13,729 the day before. Sign our petition to give Captain Tom Moore a knighthood Speaking at Downing Street, Mr Sharma said: ""This taskforce is up and running and aims to ensure that a vaccine is made available to the public as quickly as possible."" He continued: ""It will back Britain's most promising research and position the UK as a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing. ""The taskforce will coordinate with regulators to facilitate trials that are both rapid and well supervised and will work with industries in the UK and internationally so we are in a position to manufacture vaccines at scale.

A vaccine against the novel coronavirus is seen as key to defeating the COVID-19 pandemic which has killed over 100,000 globally and delivered a large blow to the global economy. But timeframes for its development vary. While the Oxford scientists said their vaccine would be available by September, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Sanofi SA, who earlier this week said they would develop a vaccine, forecast that it would not be available until the second half of 2021. Britain's government said it wanted a vaccine to be available as quickly as possible but did not give more details on an expected timetable for development.  The taskforce will focus on five strands of activity including supporting the discovery of potential coronavirus vaccines and preparing the UK for clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing. It is also working with the Bioindustry Association, which has set up an industry-led group, to accelerate vaccine development and manufacturing. Across the UK GP surgeries have been invited to take part in the trial to determine whether it could reduce the need for affected patients to go to hospital and speed up their recovery.

421,Tesco online shopping warning: 'Free voucher' could seriously cost you | Express.co.uk,Dion Dassanayake,"  Tesco has seen its online shopping business surge in popularity throughout the coronavirus pandemic. As the country remains in lockdown, scores of people have turned to home deliveries from supermarkets like Tesco for their essentials. In recent weeks, Tesco has had to add 120,000 delivery slots to cope with increased demand sparked by COVID-19. And amid this surge in popularity for online shopping Tesco customers have been warned about a dangerous scam to look out for. A fake email claiming to be sent from Tesco has been sent out allegedly offering 'free vouchers' for all customers with the deal set to expire in April. The message says: ""Dear customer, Tesco is giving you the chance to shop for free this COVID-19 season at any of our outlets or online by giving out free vouchers. ""This offer is for All users and it will be on until the end of April 2020. To Qualify, follow the link below and input all the details required. After validation, if selected your voucher will be sent via text message or posted to your Mailbox. ""Thanks for taking part, The Tesc0 team"". READ MORE: Save money!

""The link leads to a convincing-looking #phishing website that is designed to steal your login, personal and financial information! #coronavirusfrauds"". Action Fraud said they had received 30 reports about this Tesco scam and also advised what to do if you receive the message. They said: ""Don't click on the links or attachments in suspicious emails and never respond to messages that ask for your personal or financial details"".   Tesco said they were aware of the scam and are advising anyone that has received this email to delete it. Speaking to Express.co.uk, a Tesco spokesperson said: ""We have been made aware of an email scam and are working to get this content taken down immediately. ""We advise anyone who receives his email to delete it and if any customers have already shared their personal details, they should contact their bank immediately and report this to Action Fraud."" In the email there are a number of things which giveaway that it's not genuine. One of these danger signs is the number of spelling errors in the message, with Tesco spelt 'TescO' and capitalisation in incorrect places.

302,"August Tour de France 'recipe for disaster', public health expert warns | Sport | The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeremy-whittle,"Devi Sridhar, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh and also a key adviser to the Scottish government on the Covid-19 pandemic, has described the plan to stage the Tour de France in August as a â€œrecipe for disasterâ€. â€œThe wise thing to do is cancel for this year,â€ Sridhar said. â€œItâ€™s a painful decision but they have no choice.â€ The Tour was moved this week from its original start date in late June to a new Grand DÃ©part in Nice on 29 August, following the banning of any large public events until 11 July by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. â€œThis is a long-term problem, a chronic problem,â€ Sridhar told cyclingnews.com. â€œThis virus is here to stay and will come back. Even if France gets a handle on it by August, then of course the issue is people coming in from different countries.â€ Sridhar pointed to a series of potential risks, that might even lead to the Tour being halted if there was an outbreak within the race convoy during the race. â€œThereâ€™s definitely a risk that the Tour de France moving around and unwittingly spreading the virus could kick-start a new lockdown.â€ While the Tourâ€™s television partners were delighted to hear the race was going ahead â€“ â€œItâ€™s very good news,â€ said Laurent Prudâ€™homme, director general of French Eurosport â€“ Sridhar urged the Tour owner ASO to rethink its plan. â€œThey have to weigh the risks against the benefits. Thousands of people from all over the world, gathered together, moving around, from town to town, this is where a virus could thrive â€“ it could be a recipe for disaster,â€ Sridhar said. She also suggested those arriving in Nice for the race from countries outside France should be quarantined. â€œThis [the arrival of the Tourâ€™s international convoy] could set off a new cluster of infections so youâ€™d have to think, at minimum, of a two- to three-week quarantine before they properly come into the country.â€ Ideally, Sridhar said, while acknowledging the logistics would be â€œmind-bogglingâ€, once the race has started the organisation would test everybody in the convoy every day. â€œWe know 20% to 60% of people are pre-symptomatic, in that they feel fine and exhibit no symptoms but are passing the virus to others.â€ While most European riders have reacted positively to the new scheduling, the participation of some, including the defending champion Egan Bernal, who is confined to Colombia, is not yet a given. â€œIt hasnâ€™t escaped me that the current champion is in Colombia, but Europe is at the heart of cycling and the majority of riders live in Europe,â€ the Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, said. The rescheduled dates have also caused a headache for other lesser race promoters, including the Tour of Britain organiser Sweetspot, as the postponed Tour de France now clashes with its own race on 6-13 September. Another problem for the British race is a clash of live TV coverage as the official race broadcaster ITV also shows each stage of the French race. â€œThe position we find ourselves in is unprecedented,â€ Sweetspot said in a statement. â€œWe are closely monitoring each development as it happens and acting accordingly with our partners and stakeholders across Britain to do the right thing, with the health and wellbeing of all of our supporters being of paramount importance.â€",0,
220,The Montreal Nursing Homes’ COVID-19 Fatalities. “Increasing” Quebec COVID-19 Death Rate?,William Walter Kay and Prof Michel Chossudovsky,"We bring to the attention of our readers this important article by author William Walter Kay. The article raises two fundamental issues:

The first pertains to the deplorable heath care conditions (and the lack of personnel) affecting patients in Quebec’s nursing homes and geriatric wards which inevitably have an incidence on mortality. And that mortality has nothing to do with COVID-19.

The second relates to the outright manipulation of the statistics pertaining to the causes of death in the Province of Quebec. Patients are  either diagnosed by a medical doctor, and/or “tested” for COV-19 with the standard antibody test plus respiratory tract specimen. Neither of these procedures prove unequivocally the incidence of COVID-19. Moreover, in many cases patients are arbitrarily categorized as COV-19 without a test or diagnosis.

Once the patient is categorized as COVID-19 (“presumed”, with or without tests) COVID-19 will be included as “a cause of death” (on the death certificate) irrespective of the actual health condition of the elderly patient who has passed away in the nursing home.

And then this mortality data (based on COVID-19 as a cause of death) will be tabulated and entered into the COVID-19 data banks of the Province of Quebec and Canada. And these data are then transmitted to the WHO, which will then integrate them into the global COVID-19 data bank.

In all probability, the majority of the terminally ill patients in the nursing homes did not die of COVID-19.

These recorded death statistics (arbitrarily assigned to COVID-19) will then be used to sustain the illusion that the coronavirus in Quebec is increasing at an alarming rate, thereby providing a justification to maintaining the lockdown and social distancing.

It’s a big lie. And the medical personnel and Quebec politicians know it. Yet it is not being reported by the media. Health authorities knew intimately where they were sending and confining these patients. Problems at Quebec nursing homes have been studied ad nauseam. Many homes have crowded communal dining rooms and narrow hallways. Many have wards with multiple beds per room and shared toilets. Most have residents incapable of following elementary hygiene protocols meandering about the building. Staff often work at more than one home and continued to do so during the pandemic.

Also amidst the pandemic, nursing home staff earning little more than minimum wage were expected to buy their own personal protective gear. By April’s end thousands of nursing home staff had contracted C-19 or had walked off the job. One home had 2 staff attending to 60 bedridden patients.

On April 30 the government reported 6,603 C-19 cases among nursing home residents.

Quebec’s elderly C-19 sufferers were sent to and/or confined in circumstances approaching the opposite of quarantine. The contagious were not isolated and well-tended. They were herded into cloistered proximity with the most vulnerable, then abandoned.

Quebec has 9,280 C-19 cases aged over 70. Quebec is only treating 1,763 COVID-19 sufferers in hospital (many of whom caught COVID-19 whilst in geriatric wards). Hence, thousands of C-19 patients continue to languish inside bio chambers alongside tens of thousands of elderly neighbors.",1,

In Saudi Arabia:

UPDATE: Saudi Arabia's Health Ministry said Thursday that five people have died and two other patients were in critical condition with confirmed cases of a new respiratory virus related to SARS.

The ministry said in a statement that it had informed the World Health Organization of the seven new cases of novel coronavirus.

The germ is from a family of viruses that cause the common cold, as well as SARS – the severe acute respiratory syndrome that killed some 800 people, mostly in Asia, in a 2003 epidemic. Health experts still aren't sure how humans are being infected. The new coronavirus, which can cause acute pneumonia and kidney failure, is most closely related to a bat virus and scientists are considering whether bats or other animals like goats or camels are a possible source of infection.

Since September 2012, WHO has been informed of 24 confirmed cases. Sixteen of the patients died.

The new virus was first identified last year in the Middle East and several of the people infected had all traveled to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan or Pakistan.

WHO says the virus is probably more widespread than just the Middle East and has advised countries to test any people with unexplained pneumonia. In Saudi Arabia last year, four members of the same family fell ill and two died.

The Saudi government is conducting an ongoing investigation into the outbreak.

The seven people who contracted the virus are not from the same family and there is no indication that any of them were in contact with animals or had traveled recently.

This development comes a day after Los Angeles County public health officials said it was “very possible” the area will see at least one patient, given the number of people traveling between the Southland and China.

Health screenings continue at LAX for passengers arriving from China amid the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began conducting health screenings of passengers arriving at Los Angeles International Airport from China on Saturday.

OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — A number of patients in Alameda County are being tested to see whether they have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus, according to health officials.

A spokeswoman for the Alameda County Health Department stressed Thursday that there is no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus that has led to epidemic fears and quarantines in China, as well as increased screening at San Francisco International and other airports.

 

COOKEVILLE, Tenn. — The Tennessee Department of Health says a Tennessee Tech student is being tested for the Coronavirus.

The student had ""very mild symptoms"" and had a recent travel history that met the criteria to test for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), according to university officials.

School officials say health providers quickly recognized that the patient met the testing criteria and are awaiting the results. In the meantime, the student is being kept isolated and nothing has been confirmed.

 

In Vietnam:

Two Chinese nationals in Vietnam have tested positive for the SARS-like coronavirus and are being treated in hospital, officials said Thursday.

A Chinese man living in Ho Chi Minh City was infected by his father who traveled to Vietnam on January 13 from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.

PROTECT YOURSELF NOW

Filter masks prevent tiny (microscopic) particles from going into your lungs.  They can help protect you long enough for you to get home from work, school, or to evacuate from a contaminated / infected area.  These will not function correctly if a man has any kind of beard. Beards MUST be shaven off or the mask will leak from the whiskers. They're inexpensive  $8-$12 each.  You should have at least one for each member of your family at home; in each family car and one for each of you while at work or school.

These filter masks are rated by the US Government's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

QUARANTINES COULD COME HERE, TOO!

For people in the USA, One confirmed case is already in Seattle, WA, and a new REPORTED CASE is in Brooklyn, NY. . . . When a biological Quarantine is enacted, Health Authorities cannot lift that Quarantine until TWO FULL INCUBATION PERIODS have elapsed.   There are still varying reports about the actual incubation period of THIS virus; some say four days, others say two weeks.

IF IT IS TWO WEEKS, then you have the initial Quarantine of two weeks, followed by another FOUR WEEKS where (hopefully) there are no new cases.

If YOU could not go out for a total of 6 weeks, do YOU have enough food in your house to feed yourself and your family?  If not, what do you think you would do?  You can't go out under penalty of arrest.  No one can come deliver to you because stores are all closed.  So what do you do?

STARVE!

Those of you with means, should arrange to get supplied with EMERGENCY FOOD.  Outlets specializing in that are shown below.  Get something so you can survive. UPDATE 10:55 PM EST --

China's Hubei and Guangdong provinces declare first-level public health emergency

All major hospitals in Wuhan have fallen. On the first floor of the neurosurgery, all the doctors and patients were infected, and all the wards were closed.

The director of the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Union Hospital and the director of the department of nail and breast surgery of the Central Hospital, all the recruits have been on the ventilator! Cai Xin, executive deputy editor-in-chief, said in a message:

Well over 10,000 people have become ill, and the remaining 10 million people in Wuhan are also in danger.

Chinese Government Official Proudly Boasts: ""80000 respirators donated by Chinese members of the public that live abroad, have arrived in Wuhan.  Another 160000 respirators and 15000 sets of protective coverall are on its way to Wuhan, China""   

REMARK:  (Gee, if they only have 830 sick people and only 25 deaths, why this much gear?   Oh, wait, could it be because the numbers they've given out publicly are FALSE and the numbers being reported on the Hal Turner Show web site are true?)

36,FAKE FLUS Black cats are being killed & eaten in Vietnam after fake news spreads that their ground up bodies cure coronavirus,Alahna Kindred,"BLACK cats are being killed and eaten in Vietnam after fakes news spread claiming grounding up their bodies could cure coronavirus. The No To Dog Meat charity said the cats are being boiled, skinned, cooked and then turned into a paste in order to be ingested. Disturbing images show the liquid aftermath of killing the cats packaged in containers to be sold.
One image shows a baby reportedly being fed the concoction.
The charity says the practice is centred around the capital Hanoi, but it is also being sold online.
In a graphic video obtained by the charity,a live cat in a bag being placed in a cooking pot, and boiling water being poured over it.
In another gruesome clip, rows of dead cats are seen drying in the sun after being slaughtered.
The cat-based ""cure"" is made by grinding up the cooked animals into a paste, which is then taken by those suffering from coronavirus as well as those trying not to catch it.
Julia de Cadenet, who founded the charity that campaigns the end the dog and cat meat trade, said the footage made her blood run cold.
She said: ""People all over the world are understandably terrified of COVID-19, but this does not excuse the horrific cruelty that Vietnamese people are inflicting on these poor cats.
""There is no evidence whatsoever that eating cats cures coronavirus, and even if there was, this inhumane treatment is a level of cruelty that is unacceptable even for those who eat meat.
""In China when the virus first broke rumours flew around that pets could spread the disease, this led to many people and the authorities rounding up animals and killing them.
""Our human fears about this pandemic should not be used as an excuse to treat defenceless animals who look to us for protection, with utter contempt.""
NO EVIDENCE
The horrifying images and footage come after an investigation found the coronavirus crisis has sparked a surge of sales of dog and cat meat through food delivery apps in Vietnam and Cambodia.
Despite other countries looking to reduce the sale and consumption of live animals, doctors in the region are encouraging many to eat dog and cat meat, claiming its properties help fight off viruses.
The shocking investigation, carried out by the animal charity FOUR PAWS, revealed that not only have sales risen, sellers have adapted to the market by offering the meat on food delivery apps as a takeaway option.
The horrendous trade came to light over fears that the coronavirus pandemic was sparked by a live exotic animal market in the city of Wuhan, China, back in January.
Doctors are also said to be promoting the consumption of dog meat because it is perceived to be ‘natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat’.
One seller in Cambodia said that those in her community believe that, ‘dog meat is good for health and helps ward off cold or viral illness, like COVID-19’, however the meat is often linked to outbreaks of cholera, and cases of trichinella and rabies.
There is no evidence to back up these bizarre claims.
Julia has warned both the UK Government and the UN many times that unsanitary meat production, such as the dog and cat meat trade could cause a global health crisis.",1,
341,Novo Nordisk will give free insulin to diabetes patients whose jobs were affected by the coronavirus pandemic  - CNN,"Harmeet Kaur, CNN","(CNN) One insulin maker is trying to alleviate the financial strain that people are experiencing due to the coronavirus pandemic . Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced on Tuesday that it will offer insulin free of charge for 90 days to diabetes patients who lost health insurance coverage because they lost their jobs. ""Patients have enough issues to worry about at this moment,"" Doug Langa, executive vice president of North America operations and president of Novo Nordisk, said in a statement. ""We don't want being able to pay for their insulin to be one of them."" After years of skyrocketing costs, lawmakers across the US push for caps on life-saving insulin payments The benefit is offered through the company's diabetes patient assistance program. Eligible patients must provide documentation that shows they have lost health-care coverage or that they are being offered Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) benefits. Those who can't quickly access the required documentation can take advantage of the company's immediate supply option, Novo Nordisk said in a news release. While the free insulin offer is only for 90 days, Novo Nordisk said people who are later denied Medicaid benefits can apply to receive free insulin through the end of the year. Read More Novo Nordisk is the latest insulin manufacturer to step in during the pandemic. Earlier this month, Eli Lilly announced that it would allow anyone with commercial health insurance or without health insurance to refill their insulin prescriptions for a $35 co-pay. Insulin prices are notoriously high Insulin costs between $2.28 and $3.42 for drug makers to manufacture, yet people with diabetes pay hundreds of dollars for the lifesaving drug. And though little has changed about the way insulin is produced, prices have skyrocketed -- some more than tripling over the past 10 years. As a result, as many as one in four people who take insulin skip doses because they cannot afford the medication that is keeping them alive. To combat rising prices, lawmakers across the US have begun a push to cap costs. Colorado, Illinois and New Mexico have passed legislation to cap insulin co-pays, while more than a dozen others are considering similar bills. Last year, executives from Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi -- the country's leading insulin manufacturers -- were ordered to testify on Capitol Hill regarding the rising prices of their drugs. More than 30 million people in the United States -- nearly one in every 10 Americans -- have diabetes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another estimated 84 million are prediabetic and could require insulin later in life. CNN's Alaa Elasaar contributed to this report.",0,
201,More On Coronavirus,Sally Fallon Morell,"TESTING FOR CORONAVIRUS: I received several comments challenging my statement that there is no good test for coronavirus. Please read this excellent discussion by David Crowe, of the PCR test, used to determine the presence of coronavirus. To quote: “The coronavirus test is based on PCR, a DNA manufacturing technique. When used as a test it does not produce a positive/negative result, but simply the number of cycles required to detect sufficient material to beat the arbitrary cutoff between positive and negative. If positive means infected and negative means uninfected, then there are cases of people going from infected to uninfected and back to infected again in a couple of days.”  In other words, lab technicians can get the result they want by setting the number of cycles they do in the test.

More from Crowe: “Scientists are detecting novel RNA in multiple patients with influenza or pneumonia-like conditions, and are assuming that the detection of RNA (which is believed to be wrapped in proteins to form an RNA virus, as coronaviruses are believed to be) is equivalent to isolation of the [corona]virus. It is not, and one of the groups of scientists was honest enough to admit this: ‘we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood.’” To determine whether a person died from coronavirus, you need to detect the virus in the blood post mortem, and in general these tests are not being done.

And even if they were, the rate of false positives makes the testing meaningless.  According to one published study, “In those close contact of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more the ‘asymptomatic infected individuals’ reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.”  (Please note that this study has since been “Retracted,” meaning it was not acceptable to health authorities.)

So, I am sticking to my statement. The tests for corona virus are not good; whatever we are reading in the papers or hearing on the news about coronavirus should be interpreted with this fact in mind and pretty much makes all the statistics meaningless.

IS CORONA VIRUS CONTAGIOUS? This is the assumption that drives all conventional medicine.  But many experts, including virologists, hold a different view—that the viral material is not attacking the body to make it sick, but that sick bodies give off the viral material in efforts to detoxify.  If this is the case, then quarantining and social distancing are not necessary, and even counterproductive, as such measures create fear and loneliness, certainly not conducive to good health and healing.

HOW BAD IS CORONAVIRUS? Is this a pandemic that is filling the hospitals? Here’s where it gets confusing.  I’ve had first hand reports of overcrowding and chaotic conditions in some hospitals, but also reports of hospitals where everything is normal, with only two or three people in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or even completely empty.  See this report on a hospital in Berlin.

We also need to know how many deaths attributed to corona virus are actually deaths from existing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, all potentially exacerbated by panic. In Italy, more than 99 percent of fatalities attributed to coronavirus were in patients suffering from previous medical conditions. I do not want to minimize the suffering of those who are sick—indeed it does seem that there is an outbreak of severe respiratory illness, at least in certain locations.  But I do not believe that this justifies shutting down the world economy, removing our right to assemble or practice religion, and making it illegal to give folks a hug. When this is all over, I’d like to know the disease and death rate in areas where the restaurants have remained open and quarantining is not required, compared to those areas where governments are imposing draconian measures.

WHAT’S CAUSING THE CURRENT OUTBREAK OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS? I think the best theory is the rollout of 5G, which at 60 gigahertz disrupts oxygen, including oxygen in your cells.  5G has a similar frequency to the scanning machines used in airports—and have you ever noticed that pregAnonymoust women and children are not put through these machines?  And 5G bathes us in this frequency not for a few brief seconds, but 24/7. This explains the cases of people literally collapsing in the streets in Wuhan. Wuhan was the first Chinese city to roll out 5G.  The Princess line boasts state-of-the-art Wi-Fi , presumably 5G, throughout the ship. Kirkland, Washington, where the first coronavirus cases appeared in the U.S. was an early 5G location and home of a number of IT companies boasting about getting 5G inside buildings. 5G blankets northern Italy and parts of Spain and is now installed in many U.S. cities.

If 5G is the precipitating cause, many other factors may make people susceptible to respiratory disease, such as vaccinations (including mass vaccination campaigns in China and a “novel” Italian influenza vaccine introduced in late 2019, known to increase susceptibility to coronavirus), exposure to toxins like diesel fumes from old vehicles (really a problem in many European cities) and jet fuel fumes (lots of cases in Brooklyn and the Bronx, near major NY airports), high intake of glyphosate in wheat and other foods, having metal in the body (from amalgam fillings, aluminum in vaccinations, pins, implants, etc.) smoking, taking statins or blood pressure medications–and the standard American diet.

The important thing is not to panic. Most people recover from this illness—it has a much lower death rate than the common flu. And this too shall pass–with many potential silver linings—including a wake up about the dangers of 5G. Meanwhile, a nutrient-dense diet including cod liver oil, liver, raw milk, oysters and meat, butter and eggs from grass-fed animals will provide protection against all these toxic influences as well as help in maintaining mental equanimity during these troubling times.",1,
152,COVID-19: Some Thoughts On The Impending Collapse Of The State,Anonymous,"Most people living the “West” have been telling themselves they were citizens of a democratic state. Not surprising, since they were taught this in school and have been hearing the same ever since from their media. Few realize that the much-vaunted democracies they reside in, are at best just badly disguised plutocracies, certainly since the Fall of the Berlin Wall, when neoliberal capitalism was adopted as the universal state ideology in the “West.” This has led to the establishment of what may be properly called kakistocracy, the Greek word for rule by the worst elements in society. Since the availability of easy money has siphoned off many otherwise capable and talented people to the world of business and banking, politics has been abandoned to men (and women) without qualities. Effortlessly adopting whatever form, stance or position only to get ahead in the world and line their pockets along the way, most of these new generation politicians have no morals, no intelligence, no principles, no ideas, nothing.

The choices made by “Western” governments in response to the “corona pandemic” are a case in point. From the point of view of medicine and public health, the dreaded coronavirus is not a serious problem. Sure enough, the World Health Organization, headed by a politician with a dodgy past and funded largely by Bill Gates, has officially declared a pandemic. In response, one “Western” government after another has declared a national emergency and put the country in lockdown. As a result, millions and millions are now losing their jobs and entire national economies are made to suffer irreparable damage, yet aggregate average monthly death rates are not even higher than in 2019, 2018 and 2017. From the very beginning, aided by a supine press, governments have been fiddling with the numbers, going to extremes to give the impression that the coronavirus death toll is appalling.

The question arises as to why a responsible government would want to wreck the national economy, cause incredible personal suffering by forbidding people to leave their homes, and to wreak irreparable social havoc al for the sake of a handful of fat, unhealthy elderly citizens with respiratory problems caused by the virus? Most of these patients had a very low life expectancy to begin with, then why overburden and imperil the entire heath care system? Are those the policies that a responsible government would adopt? If so, that would give the word “responsible” a whole new meaning.

Only a government without a grasp of reality, with a total lack of ethical and political principles, accustomed to trampling on the rights of citizens for decades, would decree a total lockdown just to save a few people, or a government that would be taking orders from some unknown higher authority. But let us not go in that direction for the moment. Let us assume the lockdowns were ordered by incompetent and irresponsible leaders. The next question then should be if those governments were aware of the possible consequences of their decrees.

What might these consequences be? In the first place, widespread bankruptcies. As a result of government-ordered closing, countless retailers, bars, and restaurants will disappear, forever changing inner cities. Many small industries will also have to close down. Big players like Amazon, Starbucks and assorted fast food giants will gladly fill any gaps, which means that those laid off as a result of bankruptcies will be forced to either take low-paid wage-slave work or be without a job for many years to come. GNP will shrink everywhere, and average incomes will drop sharply. Faced with high budget deficits, governments will have to resort to widespread tax increases, causing even more social misery. Crime rates will soar, inner cities and many residential areas will morph into no-go areas. Many cities will begin to look like Dearborn, Michigan.

Secondly, most people will have lost their trust in government, while many will be very angry and try to oppose, subvert and sabotage government policies. Very likely, most “Western” governments will face a legitimacy crisis never seen before. Government authority is likely to crumble everywhere, except in those few areas where the rich assemble, living in permanent fear of the rabble's wrath.

Many places will be taken over by a kind of permanent, low-intensity civil war, as predicted by Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld. Western Europe will begin to look a lot like Libya after the NATO intervention, war-torn Yemen or Syria. Governments facing increased breakdown of law and order will tend to resort to violent repression and some may succeed in clinging to power that way. Others will be overthrown, setting off an endless chain of power grabs and armed political struggle. Civil war may come to many places.

Would all those fools still in power have realized such might be the result of their hypocritical decision to “protect the citizens against COVID-19?” If they haven't, it might actually be kind of reassuring.

If they have and the current socio-economic destruction is intentional, it would mean their objective is precisely that: to destroy the economy, to drive the citizens to despair and to roll out a totalitarian state.",1,
475,Stocks slide and dollar rally runs as economic realities bite - Reuters,Tom Westbrook,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asiaâ€™s stock markets retreated from their highest levels for a month and the dollar extended gains on Thursday as the damage the coronavirus has wrought on the world economy soured appetite for risk. Data showed U.S. retail sales fell the most on record last month and manufacturing output fell by the most in 74 years, raising fears of a deep recession. Another sky high figure is expected when U.S. weekly jobless claims land later in the day. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 ESc1 fell half a percent in Asia after a 2.2% drop on the index .SPX on Wednesday and European futures were marginally lower STXEc1 FFIc1. MSCIâ€™s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS lost about 1%, wiping out early week gains that had taken the index to its best level since mid-March. â€œMarkets seem to have run out of good news to trade off,â€ said Kyle Rodda, analyst at IG Markets in Melbourne. â€œThey are still effectively betting on the global economy springing out of this in an energetic fashion, but the challenge is that no-one can give with any level of certainty what the future is going to be like.â€ The risk-sensitive Australian dollar AUD=D3 fell to a one-week low and oil prices struggled to rise against the expectation of cratering demand. U.S. crude CLc1 sat at $19.90 per barrel, 70 cents above an 18-year low hit on Wednesday, and Brent crude LCOc1 rose 28 cents or 1% in Asian trade to $27.92 per barrel. The International Monetary Fund is predicting zero growth in Asia this year for the first time in 60 years, as exporters are pounded by slumping demand and anti-virus measures force consumers to stay home and shops to shut down. China is expected to report on Friday that the health crisis likely knocked its economy into its first decline on record. In Japan, where a Reuters survey showed most firms feel stimulus measures announced so far were insufficient, the Nikkei .N225 fell 1.3%. Benchmark indexes in Australia , Hong Kong .HSI and Shanghai .SSEC also posted falls between 0.4% and 1.3% and emerging markets fell harder. â€œA recovery timeline...remains impossible to predict,â€ said Ronald Lam, chief customer officer at airline Cathay Pacific (0293.HK), which has slashed nearly all its passenger capacity and lost a fifth of its value this year. Millions more Americans likely sought unemployment benefits last week, lifting total filings for claims over the past month above an astounding 20 million. Official data is due at 1230 GMT, with a weekly figure of 5.1 million expected. The U.S. dollar extended its rally against the risk-sensitive Antipodean currencies, for its best two-day gains against the Australian and New Zealand dollars in a month. It rose on the yen, euro and pound and last bought 107.94 yen JPY= and traded at $0.6273 per Aussie AUD=D3 and $1.0875 per euro EUR=. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RR were pinned at 0.6456%, more than 100 basis points below where they began the year. The path to an economic re-start and the effectiveness of gigantic stimulus packages around the world is also unclear. In the United States, the hardest-hit nation, the coronavirus death toll topped 30,000 on Wednesday and set a record single-day increase for the second day running. President Donald Trump said he would announce guidelines for reopening the economy on Thursday, however, state governors - especially on the East Coast - seem to be pushing for a cautious approach. â€œMarkets are looking for the peak in the viral spread, but this is only the start of a very bumpy road back to economic strength,â€ said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. â€œInvestors should remain vigilant to what the market is pricing and realise that market rallies in a longer bear market are not unusual.â€ Reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore and Koh Gui Qing in New York; Editing by Sam Holmes",0,
96,Gates – WHO – World Bank – just lost billions as President Trump – Trumped!,Helena,"In 2017, the World Bank collaborated with WHO, Bill Gates, Soros, and a number of governments and private investors to create Pandemic Bonds to assist aid agencies with managing the crisis that a pandemic outbreak would cause.   Sounds reasonable – sortof…

These bonds were issued with a maturity date of July 15, 2020, paying 6.5 to 11% interest above Libor, and were created to only apply to a pandemic resulting from flu – or coronavirus.   (In other words, they felt the probability of a pandemic from Coronavirus was possible as of 2017.)   Meaning that the bond would mature at par or premium as of that date, 7/15/2020, if no pandemic was called by WHO.   Mind you – 2017.   The interest payments have been funded by the governments -our good friends – Germany and Japan.

Today Class A Bonds are trading at a 25% discount and Class B Bonds are trading at a 95% Discount… meaning investors LOST money, and may explain the reluctance of WHO to declare a pandemic knowing the money that Gates and others would lose.

Another ‘term’ of the Bond was that money would not be released to actually help any country until 12 weeks after the Pandemic was declared.

March 11th was the Pandemic declaration by WHO – meaning any actual assistance wouldn’t be released until June 3rd  – at which point the Bonds may be deemed Junk and there is no money to aid.

Given there is evidence that WHO was aware of the potential for pandemic as far back as October or November, given that China massively attempted to cover up any indication of a fault line erupting, it opens the question if there were not other mechanisms in play to utilize the ‘element of surprise’ and take the Bishop and Castle from the chessboard.

TO add to the misery of the game, Gates and Gilead Science were busily preparing a vaccine to fight a pandemic before it existed.

The 2019 newly appointed CEO of Gilead formerly was with Genentech, a biotech corporation that in 2018 created a flu medication for Influenza A and B called Xlfluza. The typical side effects of this medication include: diarrhea, bronchitis, common cold, headache and nausea.   Coincidentally similar to the symptoms of CoVid.

When President Trump announced March 22nd that hydroxychloroquine could be a breakthrough breath of fresh air in curing CoVid, Gilead was left hanging in the proverbial wind with their Remdesivir drug that was believed to be the ‘only’ means of eradicating the virus.   Gates is fully fiAnonymouscially linked to Gilead.

So now not only has Gates lost the value of his Bond investment in PEF, he is facing the possibility that his vaccine billions and his intermediary drug, Remdesivir, will be wholly worth $-0-.

ALL his plans for a pandemic billionaire convention hoard – have just been completely decimated!

So he orders his minions to shut down the economy while he regroups.   If he lost money, then everyone should lose money! While he thinks, while he ponders, how to rectify these losses that were all chess moves initiated by President Trump.

There are literally infinite numbers of NGO’s tasked with global health, pandemics, virus mitigation, biologic warfare, and infectious disease research!   Perhaps thousands.   And yet NOT ONE seemed to gain any notoriety for their CoVid prevention and/or awareness and/or aid.   NONE.

Unitaid is another Bill Gates propaganda machinization.   Founded in 2006 with a net worth of $1.6 billion, they are supposed to be our defense mechanism against the rise of global pandemics. Funded by Gates, France, the UK, Brazil, Norway, Chile, Spain and Korea, it would seem they did absolutely nothing to mitigate against our current pandemic.   $3 billion in revenue. But then their primary source of income is an ‘airline ticket tax’ which likely went to $-0- as a result of closed borders and the shuttering of airline traffic…

Gates has to be absolutely FUMING!

But then so is Clinton. In 2007, the Clinton Global Health Initiative and Unitaid worked in conjunction to supply drugs to Africa, specifically, ‘subsidized anit-malaria drugs’.

Don’t forget, Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malaria drug in common distribution and relatively cheap.   So did President Trump trump them further by discovering that an old school malaria drug would cure Covid in – according to doctors – 24 hours!? Thereby decimating their vaccine response and eradicating every single source of profit and income in this created pandemic?

And was the virus supposed to have been released later – after the maturity of the Bonds? So as to destroy the 2020 election?

All this being said, try and imagine where we might be if even one of these Gates/Clinton agendas had succeeded? And imagine how freaking filled with rage they are for being thumped each and every time!!

97,Georgetown family of three die before testing positive for coronavirus,Anonymous,"GEORGETOWN – The death of a family of three in Georgetown has been announced by the Georgetown Public Hospital.

A technician at the Guyana Power & Light Inc., whose name was given as Timothy ‘mysteriously’ died along with his wife and son within three days. The hospital has said in a statement that none of the three showed symptoms of coronavirus but tests conducted after their demise proved positive for the deadly virus.

Friends and health officials who came in contact with the family have been quarantined and been tested for coronavirus. According to the statement, 28 people have been quarantined at a special ward at the hospital.

153,Ground Control to Planet Lockdown: This Is Only a Test,Anonymous,"As much as Covid-19 is a circuit breaker, a time bomb and an actual weapon of mass destruction (WMD), a fierce debate is raging worldwide on the wisdom of mass quarantine applied to entire cities, states and nations.

Those against it argue Planet Lockdown not only is not stopping the spread of Covid-19 but also has landed the global economy into a cryogenic state – with unforeseen, dire consequences. Thus quarantine should apply essentially to the population with the greatest risk of death: the elderly.

With Planet Lockdown transfixed by heart-breaking reports from the Covid-19 frontline, there’s no question this is an incendiary assertion.

In parallel, a total corporate media takeover is implying that if the numbers do not substantially go down, Planet Lockdown – an euphemism for house arrest – remains, indefinitely.

Michael Levitt, 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry and Stanford biophysicist, was spot on when he calculated that China would get through the worst of Covid-19 way before throngs of health experts believed, and that “What we need is to control the panic”.

Let’s cross this over with some facts and dissident opinion, in the interest of fostering an informed debate.

The report Covid-19 – Navigating the Uncharted was co-authored by Dr. Anthony Fauci – the White House face of the fight –, H. Clifford Lane, and CDC director Robert R. Redfield. So it comes from the heart of the U.S. healthcare establishment.

The report explicitly states, “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.”

On March 19, four days before Downing Street ordered the British lockdown, Covid-19 was downgraded from the status of “High Consequence Infectious Disease.”

John Lee, recently retired professor of pathology and former NHS consultant pathologist, has recently argued that, “the world’s 18,944 coronavirus deaths represent 0.14 per cent of the total. These figures might shoot up but they are, right now, lower than other infectious diseases that we live with (such as flu).”

He recommends, “a degree of social distancing should be maintained for a while, especially for the elderly and the immune-suppressed. But when drastic measures are introduced, they should be based on clear evidence. In the case of Covid-19, the evidence is not clear.”

That’s essentially the same point developed by a Russian military intel analyst.

No less than 22 scientists – see here and here – have expanded on their doubts about the Western strategy.

Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, Professor Emeritus of Medical Microbiology at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, has provoked immense controversy with his open letter to Chancellor Merkel, stressing the “truly unforeseeable consequences of the drastic containment measures which are currently being applied in large parts of Europe.”

Even New York governor Andrew Cuomo admitted on the record about the error of quarantining elderly people with illnesses alongside the fit young population.

The absolutely key issue is how the West was caught completely unprepared for the spread of Covid-19 – even after being provided a head start of two months by China, and having the time to study different successful strategies applied across Asia.

There are no secrets for the success of the South Korean model.

South Korea was producing test kits already in early January, and by March was testing 100,000 people a day, after establishing strict control of the whole population – to Western cries of “no protection of private life”. That was before the West embarked on Planet Lockdown mode.

South Korea was all about testing early, often and safely – in tandem with quick, thorough contact tracing, isolation and surveillance.

Covid-19 carriers are monitored with the help of video-surveillance cameras, credit card purchases, smartphone records. Add to it SMS sent to everyone when a new case is detected near them or their place of work. Those in self-isolation need an app to be constantly monitored; non-compliance means a fine to the equivalent of $2,800.

Controlled demolition in effect

In early March, the Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases, hosted by the Shanghai Medical Association, pre-published an Expert Consensus on Comprehensive Treatment of Coronavirus in Shanghai. Treatment recommendations included, “large doses of vitamin C…injected intravenously at a dose of 100 to 200 mg / kg per day. The duration of continuous use is to significantly improve the oxygenation index.”

That’s the reason why 50 tons of Vitamin C was shipped to Hubei province in early February. It’s a stark example of a simple “mitigation” solution capable of minimizing economic catastrophe.

In contrast, it’s as if the brutally fast Chinese “people’s war” counterpunch against Covid-19 had caught Washington totally unprepared. Steady intel rumbles on the Chinese net point to Beijing having already studied all plausible leads towards the origin of the Sars-Cov-2 virus – vital information that will be certainly weaponized, Sun Tzu style, at the right time.

As it stands, the sustainability of the complex Eurasian integration project has not been substantially compromised. As the EU has provided the whole planet with a graphic demonstration of its cluelessness and helplessness, everyday the Russia-China strategic partnership gets stronger – increasingly investing in soft power and advancing a pan-Eurasia dialogue which includes, crucially, medical help.

Facing this process, the EU’s top diplomat, Joseph Borrell, sounds indeed so helpless: “There is a global battle of narratives going on in which timing is a crucial factor. […] China has brought down local new infections to single figures – and it is now sending equipment and doctors to Europe, as others do as well. China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the U.S., it is a responsible and reliable partner. In the battle of narratives we have also seen attempts to discredit the EU (…) We must be aware there is a geo-political component including a struggle for influence through spinning and the ‘politics of generosity’. Armed with facts, we need to defend Europe against its detractors.”

That takes us to really explosive territory. A critique of the Planet Lockdown strategy inevitably raises serious questions pointing to a controlled demolition of the global economy. What is already in stark effect are myriad declinations of martial law, severe social media policing in Ministry of Truth mode, and the return of strict border controls.

These are unequivocal markings of a massive social re-engineering project, complete with inbuilt full monitoring, population control and social distancing promoted as the new normal.

That would be taking to the limit Secretary of State Mike “we lie, we cheat, we steal” Pompeo’s assertion, on the record, that Covid-19 is a live military exercise: “This matter is going forward — we are in a live exercise here to get this right.”

All hail BlackRock

So as we face a New Great Depression, steps leading to a Brave New World are already discernable. It goes way beyond a mere Bretton Woods 2.0, in the manner that Pam and Russ Martens superbly deconstruct the recent $2 trillion, Capitol Hill-approved stimulus to the U.S. economy.

Essentially, the Fed will “leverage the bill’s $454 million bailout slush fund into $4.5 trillion”. And no questions are allowed on who gets the money, because the bill simply cancels the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for the Fed.

The privileged private contractor for the slush fund is none other than BlackRock. Here’s the extremely short version of the whole, astonishing scheme, masterfully detailed here.

Wall Street has turned the Fed into a hedge fund. The Fed is going to own at least two thirds of all U.S. Treasury bills wallowing in the market before the end of the year.

The U.S. Treasury will be buying every security and loan in sight while the Fed will be the banker – fiAnonymouscing the whole scheme.

So essentially this is a Fed/ Treasury merger. A behemoth dispensing loads of helicopter money – with BlackRock as the undisputable winner.

BlackRock is widely known as the biggest money manager on the planet. Their tentacles are everywhere. They own 5% of Apple, 5% of Exxon Mobil, 6% of Google, second largest shareholder of AT&T (Turner, HBO, CNN, Warner Brothers) – these are just a few examples.

They will buy all these securities and manage those dodgy special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) on behalf of the Treasury.

BlackRock not only is the top investor in Goldman Sachs. Better yet: Blackrock is bigger than Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank combined. BlackRock is a serious Trump donor. Now, for all practical purposes, it will be the operating system – the Chrome, Firefox, Safari – of Fed/Treasury.

This represents the definitive Wall Street-ization of the Fed – with no evidence whatsoever it will lead to any improvement in the lives of the average American.

Western corporate media, en masse, have virtually ignored the myriad, devastating economic consequences of Planet Lockdown. Wall to wall coverage barely mentions the astonishing economic human wreckage already in effect – especially for the masses barely surviving, so far, in the informal economy.

For all practical purposes, the Global War on Terror (GWOT) has been replaced by the Global War on Virus (GWOV). But what is not being seriously analyzed is the Perfect Toxic Storm: a totally shattered economy; The Mother of All FiAnonymouscial Crashes – barely masked by the trillions in helicopter money from the Fed and the ECB; the tens of millions of unemployed engendered by the New Great Depression; the millions of small businesses that will simply disappear; a widespread, global mental health crisis. Not to mention the masses of elderly, especially in the U.S., that will be issued an unspoken “drop dead” notice.

Beyond any rhetoric about “decoupling”, the global economy is already, de facto, split in two. On one side, we have Eurasia, Africa and swathes of Latin America – what China will be painstakingly connecting and reconnecting via the New Silk Roads. On the other side, we have North America and selected Western vassals. A puzzled Europe lies in the middle.

A cryogenically induced global economy certainly facilitates a reboot. Trumpism is the New Exceptionalism – so that means an isolationist MAGA on steroids. In contrast, China will painstakingly reboot its market base along the New Silk Roads – Africa and Latin America included – to replace the 20% of trade/exports to be lost with the U.S.

The meager $1,200 checks promised to Americans are a de facto precursor of the much touted Universal Basic Income (UBI). They may become permanent as tens of millions of people will be permanently unemployed. That will facilitate the transition towards a totally automated, 24/7 economy run by AI – thus the importance of 5G.

And that’s where ID2020 comes in.

AI and ID2020

The European Commission is involved in a crucial but virtually unknown project, CREMA (Cloud Based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing) which aims to facilitate the widest possible implementation of AI in conjunction to the advent of a cashless One-World system.

The end of cash necessarily implies a One-World government capable of dispensing – and controlling – UBI; a de facto full accomplishment of Foucault’s studies on biopolitics. Anyone is liable to be erased from the system if an algorithm equals this individual with dissent.

It gets even sexier when absolute social control is promoted as an innocent vaccine.

ID2020 is self-described as a benign alliance of “public-private partners”. Essentially, it is an electronic ID platform based on generalized vaccination. And its starts at birth; newborns will be provided with a “portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity.”

GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, pledges to “protect people’s health “ and provide “immunization for all”. Top partners and sponsors, apart from the WHO, include, predictably, Big Pharma.

At the ID2020 Alliance summit last September in New York, it was decided that the “Rising to the Good ID Challenge” program would be launched in 2020. That was confirmed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) this past January in Davos. The digital identity will be tested with the government of Bangladesh.

That poses a serious question: was ID2020 timed to coincide with what a crucial sponsor, the WHO, qualified as a pandemic? Or was a pandemic absolutely crucial to justify the launch of ID2020?

As game-changing trial runs go, nothing of course beats Event 201, which took place less than a month after ID2020.

The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with, once again, the WEF, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, described Event 201 as “a high-level pandemic exercise”. The exercise “illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.”

With Covid-19 in effect as a pandemic, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health was forced to issue a statement basically saying they just “modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction”.

There’s no question “a severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions”, as spun by the sponsors. Covid-19 is eliciting exactly this kind of “cooperation”. Whether it’s “reliable” is open to endless debate.

The fact is that, all over Planet Lockdown, a groundswell of public opinion is leaning towards defining the current state of affairs as a global psyop: a deliberate global meltdown – the New Great Depression – imposed on unsuspecting citizens by design.

The powers that be, taking their cue from the tried and tested, decades-old CIA playbook, of course are breathlessly calling it a “conspiracy theory”. Yet what vast swathes of global public opinion observe is a – dangerous – virus being used as cover for the advent of a new, digital fiAnonymouscial system, complete with a forced vaccine cum Anonymousochip creating a full, individual, digital identity.

The most plausible scenario for our immediate future reads like clusters of smart cities linked by AI, with people monitored full time and duly micro-chipped doing what they need with a unified digital currency, in an atmosphere of Bentham’s and Foucault’s Panopticum on overdrive.

So if this is really our future, the existing world-system has to go. This is a test, this is only a test.",1,
493,Fresh produce in Europe set to be more scarce as coronavirus strikes - Reuters,"Duncan Miriri, Nigel Hunt","NAIROBI/LONDON (Reuters) - Fresh fruit and vegetables will become increasingly scarce in Europe, suppliers warn, as the coronavirus pandemic hampers the global movement of produce and of the people needed to gather crops. Governments are looking at ways to ease any shortage, including â€œgreen lanesâ€ to allow fresh produce to move quickly across EU borders, recruiting a â€œshadow armyâ€ of harvesters and loosening travel rules for migrant workers. While Europeâ€™s supermarkets say they are still getting most produce, supply pressures are building at source, including in Africa, a key provider of fresh goods, and within Europe. Stores that are already dealing with hoarding by customers may struggle to keep shelves stocked. In Kenya, a major supplier of green beans and peas to Europe, half of the workers in the sector have been sent home on mandatory leave because of the industryâ€™s inability to ship orders, even as demand from European retailers surge. â€œTheir (European) stocks are being depleted by the day,â€ said Okisegere Ojepat, chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium of Kenya which groups over 200 growers and exporters. Shipments from another key supplier, South Africa, are becoming more challenging with the country set to begin a 21-day lockdown this week. â€œWe were in reasonably good shape until earlier this week but now things are becoming very difficult,â€ said Hans Muylaert-Gelein, Managing Director at Fruits Unlimited, a South Africa-based company that exports fruits and vegetables to the UK. â€œMore and more flights are being grounded so I expect there are going to be big disruptions.â€ Those planes that are flying are charging more. Operators have tripled the price per kilo of produce to $3 in the past two weeks, said Hosea Machuki, head of the Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya representing 117 growers and exporters. Western supply chains are buckling as problems ranging from a shortage of truck drivers to restrictions on seafarers hit the smooth flow of goods, freight logistics operators say. Even longer-lasting produce like citrus fruit, which is normally transported by sea, could be stranded because of the shortage of containers linked to Chinaâ€™s shutdown, said Muylaert-Gelein. â€œOranges and lemons, the old ambassadors of Vitamin C, are in high demand. Also roots, carrots, cabbages, anything that has health properties people have stocked up on,â€ he told Reuters. A shortage of migrant workers also threatens to disrupt production in several top European suppliers including Spain, the biggest exporter of fruit and vegetables in the EU. Some 16,000 Moroccan seasonal workers, mostly women, were expected to arrive in the Huelva region in Spain to pick strawberries and red fruits under an agreement between the two countries. Less than half had made it by March 12, as Morocco closed its borders to passenger traffic, said AbdelmounaÃ¯m Madani, head of the Moroccan job promotion agency ANAPEC. The countryâ€™s lockdown is due to last until April 20. Farmers and unions in Spain said the production, processing and export of fruit and vegetables was still going smoothly, although the state of emergency is restricting peopleâ€™s access to farms and packing areas. Absentee rates were as high as 50% in recent days, said agricultural worker union representative Monica Vega. Philippe Binard, General Delegate of Freshfel Europe, which represents Europeâ€™s fresh produce industry, said the main problem was the lack of seasonal workers, especially for labor-intensive crops like strawberries and asparagus. The challenges included moving workers from accommodation to farms while maintaining social distancing, he said. â€œBefore they were collected in a minivan of eight or nine people and then worked the day and then moved back. Now these collective transports are no longer possible.â€ Binard said supermarkets may move towards selling produce which could be more easily mechanized in the supply chain. Heinz Schibli runs a farm growing strawberries, raspberries and blackberries in the rolling countryside just south of the Rhine River near Winterthur, Switzerland. All of his crops are destined for the Swiss market. Typically, he would now have about 30 workers from Slovakia, Romania and Poland working in his fields and greenhouse, either preparing the first strawberries of the season for harvest next month, or getting ready for the new round of planting. By May, heâ€™ll need 70 as harvest season begins in earnest. So far, only 12 harvest workers have arrived, as those due to come this week have been blocked either by restrictions in their own countries or on transiting Germany and Austria to get to Switzerland. Given the uncertainty, Schibli is talking with local authorities about enlisting local unemployed people or asylum seekers waiting for their cases to be resolved. â€œThe worst-case scenario is that we wonâ€™t be able to plant all the berries that we normally would after the first round is harvested, or that we wouldnâ€™t even be able to do the actual harvest,â€ Schibli told Reuters. The Swiss government on Wednesday announced 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.6 billion) in no- or low-interest loans to help small businesses like Schibliâ€™s make it through the coronavirus crisis should their income dry up. In Germany, whose food sector relies on some 286,000 seasonal workers every year, the agriculture minister has talked with carrier Lufthansa to see if they could be flown in, if they can prove they are not infected. Other ideas include temporarily easing the time limit for seasonal workers beyond the current 70 days. France, where farmers forecast a shortage of around 200,000 laborers during the harvest period, has also appealed to newly laid-off workers to help pick fruit and vegetables. Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume issued a rallying cry to what he called Franceâ€™s â€œshadow armyâ€. Border restrictions introduced to stem the spread of the virus also disrupt the movement of produce within the EU, with traffic jams of up to 18 hours at some border points. The European Commission has urged the 27 EU countries to adopt measures to ensure the free flow of freight along â€œgreen lanesâ€ with border crossings lasting no more than 15 minutes. Norbert Lins, chair of the agriculture committee of the European Parliament, said â€œgreen lanesâ€ also had to apply to essential inputs such as feed, fertilisers and plant protection products. He also called on the EUâ€™s executive and member states to find ways to allow some sort of cross-border movement for seasonal workers during the harvest season, even if travel restrictions are still in place. European food retailers are keeping a close eye on the situation. A spokesman for the Aldi Nord discount supermarket chain said that in Germany, fruit and vegetable supplies were secure and supply chains were functioning. â€œDespite this we are watching the current developments and making a new assessment of the situation from day to day.â€ A spokeswoman for UK-based food retailer Tesco said she could not comment specifically on fruit and vegetables but in general there had been a surge in demand and there had been some empty shelves as a result. â€œWe would ask our customers to buy only what they need so that there is enough for everyone,â€ she said in a statement.

87,Experts cannot find a single child under 10 who has passed on coronavirus to an adult despite huge trawl of data raising hopes they pose no risk,FAITH RIDLER,"No child is known to have passed on Covid-19 to an adult, a medical review has found, as evidence suggests youngsters 'do not play a significant role' in transmission.

A review of paediatric coronavirus evidence revealed 'the China/WHO joint commission could not recall episodes during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult.'    

Researchers have also failed to uncover any cases of children under the age of 10 transmitting the virus, which has killed more than 26,000 people in the UK. 

Studies into the impact of coronavirus on children also found it likely youngsters 'do not play a significant role' in transmission of the virus, although experts admitted the facts are still 'unclear'. Professor Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, told the Telegraph: 'From around the world we are not seeing evidence that children are involved in spreading or transmitting the virus, but we do not have enough evidence.' The review of 'pertinent paediatric literature' regarding coronavirus, led by Dr Alasdair Munro and published in partnership with the RCPCH, found current evidence 'consistently demonstrates reduced infection and infectivity of children in the transmission chain.'  Among the studies considered was an infected nine-year-old boy in France who did not pass the vicious virus on to anyone - despite being in contact with 172 people while contagious. 

The unnamed boy was at the centre of a cluster of cases which made international headlines in February.

He and 10 others were struck down while staying in a ski chalet in the French Alps as Steve Walsh, one of the first Britons known to have the virus.

The child went to three different ski schools in eastern France while unknowingly infected, and mingled with other people. 'Whilst a single case study, this evidence suggests different transmission dynamics from children, supporting other data which consistently demonstrates reduced infection and infectivity of children in the transmission chain,' Don't Forget the Bubbles researchers said of the case. 

Researchers added that studies of 'multiple family clusters' in Guanzhou, China also suggested children were unlikely to be 'the index case.' 

The review concluded: 'Covid-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or subclinical infection. 

'There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare. The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role. 

'There is no direct evidence of vertical transmission, and early evidence suggests both infected mothers and infants are no more severely affected than other groups.'   ",1,
362,Tasmania says PM was not briefed before he said doctor lied to coronavirus contact tracers | World news | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/calla-wahlquist,"Scott Morrison did not receive any advice from the Tasmanian public health director before he accused a healthcare worker of not telling the truth to the stateâ€™s contact tracing team, earning the federal government another rebuke from Tasmanian authorities. Authorities learned on Thursday night the healthcare worker had worked at three nursing homes as well as two hospitals before testing positive to Covid-19, prompting the federal government to order the mass testing of all staff and patients at those nursing homes. Morrison told Hobart radio on Friday the health worker had previously not told the truth when asked about his movements. â€œWeâ€™ve had someone down there not tell the truth to the contact tracers about where theyâ€™d been and who theyâ€™d been with and that means that a lot of people have been put at risk in north-west Tasmania,â€ Morrison said. But the director of public health, Dr Mark Veitch, said there was no suggestion the health worker had not been open with contact tracers, only that he had realised, after his initial interview, that he may have been showing symptoms earlier, causing authorities to â€œwiden the netâ€. Veitch said no one from his office had briefed the prime minister on the case and that contact tracers â€œmight not always pull out all the information that we need when we ask the questions the first timeâ€. Itâ€™s the second time in a week that federal authorities have been publicly contradicted about the situation in Tasmania, after the national chief medical officer Brendan Murphy backtracked on a claim that the outbreak on Tasmaniaâ€™s north-west coast was linked to an â€œillegal dinner partyâ€ of healthcare workers. It comes as more than 150 staff at Mersey community hospital in Devonport, also in north-west Tasmania, wrote to the state government complaining of a â€œbreakdown of trustâ€ after a senior emergency doctor was told not to speak to staff, raising concerns about the hospitalâ€™s ability to manage a coronavirus outbreak in the region. The letter raised concerns about availability of personal protective equipment and called for stronger infection control protocols to be introduced. The staff also called on the health minister, Sarah Courtney, to â€œremove the restriction on communicationâ€ imposed on the director of the emergency departments at the Mersey and North West Regional hospitals, saying she was â€œrespected for standing up for staff and patient safetyâ€. The health department has been contacted for comment. Mersey community hospital has become the centre of the health response to a Covid-19 cluster on Tasmaniaâ€™s north-west coast, after the North West Regional and North West private hospitals in Burnie were closed by the premier, Peter Gutwein, on Sunday. Patients, including some with the disease, were transferred 60km along the coast to the Mersey on Monday. Courtney promised the hospital would have pre-positioned piles of PPE on hand and would be managed in accordance with advice from infection control experts. In the letter, hospital staff said that promise was â€œnot delivered upon and has since had an enormous, snowballing effect on staff wellbeing and anxietyâ€. They said the patient transfer had â€œcaused major unrest and undue stress to staffâ€ and that safety for patients and staff had been â€œbreachedâ€. The letter said patients and staff who had tested positive to Covid-19 had been identified as having been in coronavirus-free wards and requested the entire hospital be regarded as a coronavirus hotspot, which would mean stepping up infection control measures and staffing levels. â€œOur staff, medical, nursing and clerical, across the North West are repeatedly raising numerous issues to management with no response,â€ the letter said. Courtney told reporters on Friday she had spoken to the head of the Tasmanian health department and the stateâ€™s chief medical officer immediately after receiving the letter that morning and asked them to investigate. Courtney said most of the issues raised by staff were already being addressed, and that according to her advice there were â€œappropriate levelsâ€ of pre-positioned PPE at the hospital. â€œHowever if this number of my staff are obviously very concerned then I have asked for this to be investigated further,â€ she said. â€œWe need to make sure that our staff not only are supported but are feeling supported â€¦ I want to make sure that we are taking all of the measures that we need to both practically in terms of the PPE we have deployed, but also working with our staff during a time of very high anxiety.â€ She said the government had been taking advice from infection disease specialists on the set up of the wards at the Mersey, and that protecting staff and patients was an â€œextraordinarily high priority of mineâ€. Among the concerns raised is the reopening of the emergency department at the North West Regional hospital, which Gutwein said might happen as early as Friday afternoon. Courtney said the emergency department â€œwill be open when it needs to be openedâ€. ",0,
255,Comrade Whitmer Extends Stay-Home Order to June 12th – Michigan Now Focused on Eliminating Non-Existent “Second Wave”,Sundance,"Well this is an interesting development.  The goal of the lockdown to “flatten the curve” in Michigan has now morphed into eliminating a mysterious second-wave of the COVID-19 virus that no-one has actually identified. The rules are now justified to prevent the appearance of a ghost virus. With a mysterious and invisible new-phase of the virus to battle, the Michigan stay home lock-down can possibly be extended to infinity. According to the Detroit Free Press: [Whitmer] said while coronavirus cases and deaths are clearly declining, “we are not out of the woods yet.” “If we’re going to lower the chance of a second wave and continue to protect our neighbors and loved ones from the spread of this virus, we must continue to do our part by staying safer at home,” she said in a statement first reported by the Free Press. See what Comrade Whitmer is doing there?  The objective that grants her unilateral control over the lives of all citizens, has morphed to “lowering the chance of a second wave” as the hot new justification legalizing her totalitarian dictates.

118,CDC recommends men shave their beards to protect against coronavirus,CNN Wire,"When it comes to novel coronavirus safety, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests facial hair be kept to a minimum so it fits within a facepiece respirator.
Side whiskers, soul patches, lampshades and handlebar mustaches are good to go, according to a CDC infographic. But styles like a stubble, beard, Dali and mutton chops, are not recommended because they are likely to interfere with a facepiece respirator.
Masks and respirators are being utilized around the world to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has reached more than 80,000 cases globally. A respirator covers at least the nose and mouth and protects against particles including infectious agents, the CDC said. However, the CDC does not recommend routine use outside of workplaces.
Facial hair poses a risk to the effectiveness of respirators because it may keep the exhalation valve from working properly if the two come into contact, the infographic said.
No matter the style choice, the hair should not cross the respirator sealing surface, the infographic said.
A goatee, horseshoe and villain mustache are okay, with caution, the infographic noted.",1,
47,The Coronavirus Is Not “The Plague”: It Is the U.S.,Edward Curtin,"The American people are wrapped up in themselves.  Nor do they recognize the true rats.  They are easily surprised; fooled would be a better word. Camus uses a physical plague to disguise his real subject, which is the way people react when they are physically trapped by human rats who demand they obey orders and stay physically and mentally compliant as their freedom is taken from them. The Plague is an allegorical depiction of the German occupation of France during World War II.  Camus had lived through that experience as a member of the French Resistance.  He was a writer and editor of the underground Resistance newspaper Combat, and with his artist’s touch he later made The Plague a revelatory read for today, especially for citizens of the United States, the greatest purveyor of the plague of violence in the world. We are all infected with the soul-destroying evil that our leaders have loosed upon the world, a plague of killing that is now hidden behind the coronavirus fear that is being used to institute tight government controls that many will come to rue in the months ahead, just as happened after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Coronavirus is a perfect cover-story for the occupation of the public’s mind by a propaganda apparatus that has grown even more devious over the past 19 years. Ask yourself: Where is the news about U.S. military operations in Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, Asia, etc.?  There is none in the corporate mainstream media, and little in the alternative media as well.  Have those operations ceased?  Of course not.  It’s just that the news about them, little that it was, has disappeared. Now it is all about us and the coronavirus panic.  It is about how many of us might die. It is about stocking toilet paper.  For the rich, it is about getting to their second or third houses where they can isolate themselves in splendor. As I write, 150 or so Americans are said to have died of Covid-19, and by the time you will read this the number will have climbed, but the number will be minuscule compared to the number of people in the U.S.A. and those numbers will be full of contradictions that few comprehend unless, rather than reacting in fear, they did some comprehensive research. But arguments are quite useless in a time of panic when people are consumed with fear and just react.

For we live in plague time, and the plague lives in us. But to most Americans, Covid-19 is the plague, because the government and media have said it is.  Like the inhabitants of Oran, the United States is “peopled with sleep walkers,” pseudo-innocents, who are “chiefly aware of what ruffled the normal tenor of their lives or affected their interests.”  That their own government, no matter what political party is in power (both working for “deep-state,” elite interests led by the organized criminals of the CIA), is the disseminator of a world-wide plague of virulent violence, must be denied and divorced from consensus reality.

That these same forces would use the fear of disease to cow the population should be no surprise for those who have come to realize the truth of the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the anthrax attacks that followed, both of which were used to justify the endless “wars on terror” that have killed so many around the world. It is a shock for so many people who can’t counteAnonymousce the thought that their own government could possibly be implicated in the death of thousands of U.S. citizens and the release of the deadly anthrax, which we know came from a U.S. lab and was carried out by a group of inside government perpetrators.

When it comes to the plague-stricken deaths visited on millions around the world for decades by the American government, this must be denied by diverting attention to partisan presidential politics, and now the coronavirus that engenders fear, loathing, and a child-like tendency to believe Big Brother.  The true plague, the bedrock of a nation continually waging wars through various means – i.e. bombs and economic and medical sanctions, etc. – against the world, disappears from consciousness.  As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said to 60 Minutes Lesley Stahl in 1996 when Stahl asked her if the U.S. sanctions on Iraq that had resulted in the death of 500,000 Iraqi children were worth it: “We think the price is worth it.”

For “decent folks must be allowed to sleep at night,” says the character Tarrou sarcastically; he is a man who has lost his ability to “sleep well” since he witnessed a man’s execution where the “bullets make a hole into which you could thrust your fist.” He awakens to the realization that he “had an indirect hand in the deaths of thousands of people.”  He loses any peace he had and vows to resist the plague in every way he can.  “For many years I’ve been ashamed,” he says, “mortally ashamed, of having been, even with the best intentions, even at many removes, a murderer in my turn.”

The rats are dying in the streets. They are our rats, diseased by us. They have emerged from the underworld of a nation plagued by its denial.  Unconscious evil bubbles up.  We are an infected people. Worry and irritation – “these are not feelings with which to confront plague.” But we don’t seem ashamed of our complicity in our government’s crimes around the world.  For decades we have elected leaders who have killed millions, while business went on as usual. The killing didn’t touch us. As Camus said, “We fornicated and read the papers.”  He knew better. He warned us:

It’s a wearying business being plague-stricken.  But it’s still more wearying to refuse to be it. That’s why everybody in the world looks so tired; everyone is more or less sick of plague. But that is why some of us, those who want to get the plague out of their systems, feel such desperate weariness. Yet the fight against the plague must go on.  Tarrou puts it thus: All I maintain is that on this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and it’s up to us, as far possible, not to join forces with the pestilences. That may sound simple to the point of childishness; I can’t judge if it’s simple, but I know it’s true. You see, I’d heard such quantities of arguments, which very nearly turned my head, and turned other people’s heads enough to make them approve of murder; and I’d come to realize that all our troubles spring from our failure to use plain, clear-cut language.  So I resolved always to speak – and to act – quite clearly, as this was the only way of setting myself on the right track. These days, I keep thinking of an incident that occurred when I was a young investigator of sexually transmitted diseases, working for the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare through the Public Health Service as an epidemiologist.  My job was to track down sexually transmitted diseases by finding links of sexual contacts. One day I went to interview and take a blood sample from a poor woman who had been named as a sexual contact. I knocked on her door on the third or fourth floor of a walkup apartment building.  She looked through the peep-hole and asked who it was and I told her my name and what government agency I represented. I could tell she was very wary, but she opened the door. She stood there naked, a very heavy woman of perhaps 300 pounds. She nonchalantly welcomed me in and I followed her as she padded down the hall where she took a housecoat off a hook and put it on. There is, as you know, an old tale by Hans Christian Anderson called “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” Although the emperor parades around naked, the adults make-believe he is clothed. Only a child sees the obvious. I was 23-years-old naïve young man at the time of this unforgettable incident, but it echoes in my mind as a reminder to myself that perhaps that woman was unconsciously teaching me a lesson in disguise.  The year was 1967, and when I went out to get into my government car with federal license plates, a white man in a white shirt in a white car in a poor black neighborhood, a hail of bricks rained down toward me and the car from the roof opposite.  I quickly jumped in and fled as the ghettos were exploding. Soon the National Guard would be called out to occupy them. Intuition tells me that although the emperor has no clothes and a vast PSYOPS occupation is now underway, too many are too grown-up to see it.",1,
514,"United Airlines sees $2.1 billion loss as coronavirus hits Latin America growth hopes, seeks more federal aid - Reuters",Tracy Rucinski,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (UAL.O) said on Monday it expects to report a pre-tax loss of about $2.1 billion for the first quarter, after the coronavirus outbreak smothered its growth aspirations in Latin America and led the company to seek another $4.5 billion in government aid. Chicago-based United said first quarter revenues are seen at $8 billion, down 17% from a year earlier, with the bulk of the declines in the last two weeks of March as coronavirus outbreaks accelerated globally, causing an average daily revenue loss of $100 million. The results are preliminary and final first-quarter numbers may change, it said, without disclosing a date for publication. Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) said on Monday it was delaying its first-quarter results publication to April 28 from April 23. Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) is due to publish on Wednesday. All U.S. airlines are seeking government money to help them weather what they say is the worst crisis in the industryâ€™s history. With few people flying, United said it plans to operate only about 10% of its normal schedule in May and June. In addition to $5 billion it will receive from the U.S. government to cover payroll through Sept. 30, United said it also expects to borrow up to about $4.5 billion from the U.S. Treasury Department for up to five years. Once the terms are finalized, it will have until the end of September to decide whether to draw the money. If it borrows the full amount, United would issue warrants for the Treasury to buy 14.2 million shares at its April 9 closing price of $31.50 per share. Shares in United were down about 3.7% at $28.01 in afternoon  trading. The estimated first-quarter loss includes just over $1 billion in special charges, mainly reflecting a reserve on a loan United made in connection with an investment in Colombiaâ€™s Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN as part of its plans for a larger tie-up in Latin America. The loan was backed by a controlling interest in Avianca, which has not flown any passenger flights since March 24 as its main Colombia and El Salvador hubs shut down their air spaces. Avianca has furloughed half of its staff with no pay and has not publicly disclosed when it expects to fly again as governments in Latin America repeatedly extend quarantines. United also wrote down the value of its investments in Brazilian carrier Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras and took a $50 million impairment charge for its routes in China, where the coronavirus first started to affect travel in January. U.S. airlines, including United, have warned that they will have to downsize in October if demand does not show signs of recovering. United had $6.3 billion of liquidity as of April 16, it said, and announced this weekend a sale and leaseback deal with Bank of China (BOC) Aviation involving six Boeing 787-9 jets and 16 737-9 MAX planes. The MAX jets were built for United but are parked at Boeing Co (BA.N) facilities until regulators approve the aircraft to fly again since two fatal crashes led to a global grounding last year.

468,Jim Cramer: Coronavirus has brought about the end of monetary policy,Kevin Stankiewicz@kevin_stank,"CNBC's Jim Cramer said on Monday that financial turmoil from the coronavirus shows that monetary policy is no longer an appropriate solution. ""This is just the need for fiscal policy,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""Monetary policy is over."" Last week, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half percentage point in response to the growing economic threat from COVID-19. Cramer has been critical of that decision, arguing the government should actually be stepping up to provide financial help to small and medium-sized businesses that may see significant challenges from the disease's spread. For example, he said Monday, those businesses should have an opportunity to access zero-interest loans. Cramer spoke as futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed an implied opening drop of about 1,300 points. Futures overnight were halted from falling further after hitting a level known as ""limit down."" The Dow tanked more than 2,000 points on Monday, ending the session down 7.79%. The S&P 500 went down over 7% shortly after the open, triggering the first of ""three circuit breaker thresholds."" Trading was paused for 15 minutes. After trading resumed, the S&P 500 went on to finish the day down 7.6% at 2,746.56.

428,Coronavirus crisis intensifies for airlines as UK's Flybe collapses,,"* British regional airline Flybe enters administration * Norwegian Air scraps profit guidance, cuts flights * Turkish has to fly jet home empty after virus case LONDON/OSLO, March 5 (Reuters) - The worsening coronavirus epidemic heaped fresh misery on the airlines sector on Thursday, as British regional carrier Flybe became the first big casualty of a slump in travel demand and Norwegian Air scrapped its profit guidance for this year. Airlines across the world are rushing to cut flights and costs, and warning of a hit to earnings, as a new virus that started in China spreads around the world, raising fears of a pandemic that could plunge the global economy into recession. In a sign of the difficulties this is creating for airlines, a Turkish Airlines jet was flown back to Istanbul without any passengers on board on Thursday on orders from Singapore after a passenger who had arrived on the same plane on Tuesday tested positive for the virus. Finnish national airline Finnair, meanwhile, said the impact of the new coronavirus, which has claimed more than 3,000 lives and infected tens of thousands more in over 60 countries, would be worse than the SARS epidemic in 2003. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned on Feb. 20 of a potential $29 billion hit to airlines' revenues this year, but that was before fresh travel restrictions put in place by several countries as the virus gained a stronger hold outside of China, in places such as Italy, Iran and South Korea. Among the latest events to be cancelled around this world due to the crisis is the world air traffic management congress in Madrid, which had been scheduled for March 10-12. GROUNDED The failure of British regional airline Flybe comes less than two months after a rescue due for the company was agreed by its owners and the UK government. Despite its commitment to improving regional transport links, the British government backed away from that deal due to the scale of the hit to demand from the virus outbreak. ""All flights have been grounded and the UK business has ceased trading with immediate effect,"" Flybe said as it entered administration, a form of protection from creditors. The failure of the airline, which has long struggled with losses, not only puts around 2,400 jobs at risk but could also see some regional UK airports struggle and business travel hit. Flybe carried around eight million passengers a year between 81 airports and was owned by a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital. Its collapse came a day after Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary predicted that the coronavirus crisis would lead to bankruptcies. ""It's inevitable in the next couple of weeks we'll see more failures,"" O'Leary told Reuters - citing Flybe as among the most vulnerable. ""Where you have a massive short-term decline in bookings you have a massive short-term decline in cash flow,"" he said on the sidelines of an industry event in Brussels on Tuesday. Norwegian, a pioneer of low-cost transatlantic travel, has also been struggling for years due to cut-throat competition and heavy debts built up during rapid expansion. The company, which has repeatedly raised cash from shareholders in order to stay in business, said on Thursday it was scrapping its 2020 earnings guidance, which had predicted a return to profit after three years of losses, due to the drop in travel demand and disruption caused by the virus. It also said it would cancel 22 long-haul flights between Europe and the United States from March 28 to May 5, with routes from Rome to Los Angeles, Boston and New York seeing a reduced number of departures. In addition, it will cut the number of flights between London and New York, flying twice, rather than three times, on some days. ""At this stage, it is too early to assess the full impact on our business,"" it said in a statement. Norwegian shares, which have lost more than 50% of their value this year, were down more than 3% at 0820 GMT. Willie Walsh, the outgoing CEO of British Airways parent IAG , also warned governments this week against any temptation to prop up airlines that were already struggling. ""I don't believe it's appropriate for governments to provide state aid to airlines that were not sustainable before the coronavirus,"" he said at the Brussels gathering.

151,PANDEMIC AND THE POLITICS OF SURVIVAL: THE HORIZONS OF A NEW TYPE OF DICTATORSHIP,Alexander Dugin,"The breakdown of the global liberal world order and its foundations

What is happening now is a global breakdown of the world order. It does not matter at all whether the nature of the coronavirus is artificial or not, nor is it even of principal importance whether, if it is artificial, it was deliberately released by the “world government” or not. The epidemic has begun - it is a fact. Now the main thing is to trace how the ""world government"" has reacted to it.

To clarify, the ""world government"" is the totality of global political and economic elites and the intellectuals and media (mediacrats) that serve them. Such a ""world government"" necessarily exists, because on a global scale there are strictly-defined, fundamental norms that determine the basic parameters of politics, economics and ideology.

- In the economy, the only recognized norm is capitalism, the market economy (which is disputed only by North Korea - not, and this is very important, by China, which presents its own version of national state capitalism under the management of the Communist Party).

- In politics the only recognized norm is parliamentary liberal democracy, based on civil society being the subject and source of legality and legitimacy (besides North Korea, almost everyone is in agreement with this, although China interprets ""civil society"" in a special socialist and partly national-cultural optic and carries out mediacratic screening by means other than direct parliamentary elections; and some Islamic states - for example, Iran and the Gulf monarchies - have a number of special features.)

- In ideology, everyone agrees with the arrangement that any individual has a number of inalienable rights (to life, freedom of conscience, freedom of movement, etc.) which all states and societies are obliged to guarantee.

In essence, these are the three basic principles of the global world that emerged after the collapse of the USSR and the victory of the capitalist West in the Cold War. The main players in politics, economics and ideology are concentrated in Western countries, which set the model for others. This is the core of the ""world government"". Inside this government, China is beginning to play an increasingly important role, towards which the elite of Russia and all other states are rushing.

Whether the coronavirus is artificial is not so important

It does not matter whether the coronavirus was produced artificially and deliberately used by the ""world government"" in this sense.

But it is this world, under the umbrella of such a ""world government” with all three of its axiomatic foundations, that is collapsing before our very eyes. This is reminiscent of the end of the socialist camp, the bipolar world and the USSR, but then one of two worlds disappeared, while one remained and extended its rules to all others including its yesterday's opponents. Gorbachev himself wanted to get into the ""world government"" without dissolving the USSR, but he was not accepted. Nor were the pro-Western leaders of the Russian Federation who surrendered to the West accepted. They still are not. And now, today, this very ""world government"" is collapsing. Could it have voluntarily opted for liquidation? Hardly. But it reacted to the coronavirus as if to something inevitable, and this was a choice.

There was freedom on whether or not to recognize the coronavirus as existing. And by the very fact of its recognition of the pandemic, the ""world government"" signed its own death sentence. Did it do so consciously? No more (or no less) consciously than Gorbachev in Perestroika. In the case of the USSR, one pole disappeared, while the other remained. Today the end of planetary liberal democracy means the end of everything. This system has no other paradigm - except for North Korea (which is still a pure anachronism, albeit a very interesting one) or China’s compromised version.

Who should have defeated the coronavirus and how?

The coronavirus has already struck a blow from which neither politics, economics, nor ideology will recover. The pandemic would have to have been dealt with by the existing institutions, in normal mode without changing the basic rules:

- neither in politics (meaning no quarantine, no forced isolation, let alone a state of emergency);

- nor in the economy (no remote work, no stopping of production, exchanges and fiAnonymouscial- industrial institutions or trading platforms, no vacation, etc.);

- nor in ideology (no restrictions, albeit temporary on essential civil rights, freedom of movement, the cancellation or postponement of elections, referenda, etc.).

...but all of this has already happened on a global scale, including in Western countries, i.e., in the territory of the ""world government"" itself. The very foundations of the global system have been suspended.

This is how we see the ongoing situation. For the ""world government"" to take such a step, it had to be forced to do so. By whom? After all, there simply cannot be any higher instance of authority than modern materialistic, atheistic and rationalistic humanity...

Liberalism as the final result of New Time

Let us postpone this question for later and now look at the larger historical trajectory of the modern liberal-democratic global system, that is, the government of the ""liberal political elites"" (parliamentarism), major economic players (oligarchs and transnational monopolies), the ideologists of the ""open society"" and the journalists who serve them (including moderators of sentiments on social networks and the Internet). The source of this system should be sought in the end of the Renaissance and in the “New Time” (early Modernity) that emerged therefrom, which saw a fundamental break with the Middle Ages with regard to the subject of power and, consequently, to its very nature. In the Middle Ages and in the society of Tradition overall, the legitimacy and legality of the political model of society were based on the transcendent - superhuman, divine - factor. The supreme subject of power and law was God, His revelations and the laws and settings established by Him, as well as those institutions which were considered to be his representatives on Earth: in the Christian world, these were the Church and the monarchical state. The New Time of Modernity abolished this vertical and set itself the goal of building a society on earthly foundations. Thus the main subject and source of legitimacy and legality became man, and the ""celestial government"" - the ""supra-world government"" - gave way to the ""earthly government"". Politics, economy and ideology changed accordingly: democracy, capitalism and civil society emerged.

For several centuries, these principles fought against the old (medieval) order until the last empires - the Russian, Ottoman, Austrian and German - fell in the 20th century. However, liberal democracy still had to cope with such heretical (from the liberal point of view) versions of Modernity as communism and fascism, which in their own ways interpreted ""civil society” and the human being as such: the former in class optics and the latter in national or racial terms. In 1945, the Communists and Liberals jointly ended fascism, and in 1991 the Communists fell. The liberals were the only ones left, and henceforth the ""world government"" turned from a plan into nearly a reality, as all countries and societies have recognized the standards of democracy, the market, and human rights. This is what Francis Fukuyama meant in his book The End of History and the Last Man. The history of this New Time began when the goal was set to replace the celestial subject with the earthly one, and it ended when this replacement was accomplished on a global scale.

The end of the liberal world and its parallels with the end of the USSR

Today, instead of the end of history, that is, instead of the total triumph of liberal democracy, world capitalism and the ideology of the ""open society"" (rights of the human as an individual), we have collapsed into completely new conditions overnight. This is as unexpected as the end of the USSR. Even after 1991, many people could not believe that the Soviet system had disappeared, and some cannot even realize it now. Of course, the end of globalism was sensed by some critical thinkers: it was spoken of by conservatives, and the sharp rise of China, which represents a special model of globalism, Putin's refusal to cede power to the manipulable and controllable (as the West thought) Medvedev in 2012, and perhaps most importantly, Brexit and the rise of populism, could all be considered clear signs that, despite its proximity to the final point, globalism has not only been unable to effectively achieve the “end of history”, but is beginning to paradoxically move away from it. On a philosophical level, the postmodernists began to reflect on this, loudly proclaiming that something was wrong with Modernity.

But history has no other way left: it must either move forward along the inertia which it has over the past few centuries, since New Time and the Enlightenment, or collapse. Everyone believed that somehow everything would resolve itself, and that the only thing that mattered was to effectively confront those who were categorized as the ""enemies of open society”, i.e., Putin, Iran, Islamic fundamentalism, or the new rise of nationalist movements rapidly responding to the crisis of mass migration. In general, no one thought of an alternative, even consciously ruling out such. And that is why, in the moment of serious crisis, the global liberal system has failed and collapsed. Almost no-one has understood this yet, but it has already happened. And it has happened irrevocably. Coronavirus, by its very fact and especially by the way in which it has been responded to by the ""world government"", has become the end of the modern world.

The end of ""the Ego and Its Own""

Does this mean that humanity will die? This is still unknown, but it cannot be ruled out. One can only guess whether it will perish or not. But what can already be said with certainty is that the global world order based on capitalism, liberal democracy and the principles of the sovereign individual (civil society, the open society) has already perished. It is gone, it has collapsed, although desperate efforts will still be undertaken to save it for some time to come. How they will be deployed and how long they will last is not crucial now. It cannot be ruled out that it will disappear altogether like smoke, just like the Soviet system dissolved in thin air.

That which just a second ago was, was fleeting, as if it never was. It is much more important to look at what is coming to replace the old world order.

The most important thing to understand is that it is not merely a technical failure in the system of global goverAnonymousce that has happened, but rather the resulting, final element of the entire historical process of Modernity, of New Time, over the course of which power was transferred from the celestial subject to the earthly one, and this subject itself - through the ideological and political battles of the last centuries, including the world hot and cold wars - moved towards a certain crystallization, that of parliamentary democracy, the global capitalist market and the individual endowed with rights. The whole system of modern global capitalism is built on the premise of ""the Ego and its Own"" (Max Stirner). The political rights of the ""Ego"" (the individual in complete isolation from nation, race, religion, sex, etc.) were fixed and entrenched in the global systems of political democracy. Economic rights were embodied in the norms of private property and market mechanisms. Thus, the source of political power reached its imminent limit: in liberalism and globalism, the last hints of verticality and “transcendence"" which had been preserved still at the first stages of Modernity, in particular the structures of the state, were eliminated. Hence the globalist aspiration to abolish the sovereignty of the state and transfer its powers to the supranational level, thus legalizing the ""world government"", which de facto already exists. In other words, the political, economic, and ideological history of New Time moved towards a quite definite end, in which the purely human, immanent, individual subject would be finally formed and laid as the basis for political legitimization. Little was left to chance: the complete abolition of states which took place on the level of the European Union was to be repeated on a global scale.

The cancelled finale of liberalism

This final moment, to which everything was headed, today is not merely postponed indefinitely, but is altogether cancelled. If political history could not reach this point without the coronavirus, then the whole process collapsed in the face of this epidemic. In order to effectively counteract the epidemic, the authorities of nearly all countries, including those of the West, have introduced compulsory quarantine with strict measures for its violation, or have outright declared emergency situations. The economic mechanisms of the global market have collapsed due to closure of borders, as have stock exchanges and fiAnonymouscial institutions. The open society and unhindered migration have come into direct contradiction with basic sanitary standards. In fact, a dictatorial regime has rapidly been established all over the world, under which power has been transferred to a completely new entity. Neither ""the Ego"", nor ""its Own"", nor all of the world's giant superstructures that guaranteed their legal and legitimate rights and statuses are any longer considered the source of political power. What Giorgio Agamben has called the ""naked life"", i.e., the absolutely special, physical survival imperative that has nothing to do with the logic of liberal capitalism, has come to the foreground. Neither equality, rights, law, private property, collective decision-making, the system of mutual obligations, nor any other fundamental principle of liberal democracy has real power. Only those mechanisms that contribute to survival, to stopping infection and providing for the simplest, purely physiological, needs, are important now.

But this means that the subject of power is radically changing. It is no longer the free society, nor the market, nor the humanist presumptions of the sovereign individual, nor guarantees of personal freedom and private life. All of this is to be sacrificed if the matter at hand is physical survival. Political rights are abolished, economic obligations are abolished, total surveillance and strict disciplinary control become the only overriding social norm.

If the ""world government"" has gone into a state of emergency, proved unable to or did not even dare to bypass it, or was simply forced to accept it, then this means that the paradigm which just yesterday seemed to be unshakeable has been abandoned. And in this case, there is either no ""world government"" at all, and every society saves itself as it can, or the fundamental paradigm abruptly changes and turns into something else. Both in the first and in the second cases, the former order has collapsed, and something new is being built before our very eyes.

Such radical conclusions are not just related to the scale of the pandemic, which is not even so great yet. Much more important is the perception of the epidemic by the power elites, who have so quickly and easily abandoned their seemingly inviolable foundations. That is the most fundamental thing. The measures aimed at combating the coronavirus have already undermined the foundations of liberal democracy and capitalism, rapidly abolishing the subject of power itself. From now on, the ""ego and its own"" is no longer the basis of legality and legitimacy: under the conditions of the State of Emergency, power is being transferred to another authority. Something new is becoming the bearer of sovereignty.

So what is it?

The coronavirus as the ruling subject: the secular gods of the plague

On the one hand, it could be said that the coronavirus itself (the virus has its ""royal"" name for a reason) is demonstrating a status unique to that of the subject. To better understand this, we can recall the ancient plague gods, who were considered formidable deities in the religious beliefs of the peoples of the Middle East. The peoples of Mesopotamia had Erra, Nergal, and others, and in the monotheistic traditions, in particular in Judaism, plagues were sent by the supreme deity, Yahweh, to punish the Jews for idolatry. In the Middle Ages, epidemics and plagues were considered signs of divine punishment. Traditional society can justifiably give the status of subjectivity to large-scale phenomena or link them to the divine element. However, in the New Time of Modernity, man held himself to be the complete master of life, hence the development of modern medicine, drugs, vaccines, etc. Therefore, it is as if the complete inability of governments to counteract the coronavirus today is casting mankind beyond the edge of New Time. But the God or gods to whom the modern virus plague could be ascribed and left to no longer exist. The modern world is convinced that the virus must have earthly, material and immanent origin. But what kind of materiality is stronger than man? Hereby arise the many conspiracy theories linking the origin of the virus to malefactors aspiring to establish their control over mankind. For the philosophers of ""speculative realism,"" who for decades have been thinking about the need to replace humanity with a system of objects - whether Artificial Intelligence or cyborgs - the virus itself might very well be granted the status of sovereign actor, a kind of hyperobject (a la Morton) capable of subjugating the masses of beings to its will, as does mold, the rhizome, and so on. In other words, the collapse of the liberal model brings to the forefront the hypothesis of the post-human, post-humanist actor.

Coronavirus, whose Latin name literally means “the crowned poison”, is thus (at least theoretically) a contender for the center of the new world system. If the main concern of mankind from now on will be to counteract the virus, fight against it, protect against it, etc., then the whole system of values, rules and guarantees will be rebuilt according to absolutely new principles and priorities. Speculative realists go even further and are ready to recognize in the hyperobject the presence of infernal entities of the ancient gods of chaos emerging out of the bottom of existence, but it is not necessary to go that far, insofar as, if we simply assume that

political, economic and ideological rationality will henceforth be built around the counteraction of contagious viruses, we will live in a different - for example, in a hygienocentric - world, organized in a completely different way than the modern world. The ""Ego"", ""its Own"" and all the structures which guarantee them predictability, stability and protection, which elevate them to the status of the foundations of legality and legitimacy, will fall into the background, while the coronavirus or its analogue will establish a different hierarchy, a different political and economic ontology, a different ideology.

The state vs. coronavirus. But which state?

If we look at how the fight against coronavirus is unfolding today, we can notice an abruptly sharp increase in the role of the state, which over the course of globalization was considerably relegated to the back-burner. It is at the level of the state that decisions on quarantine, self- isolation, travel bans, restrictions on freedoms and economic measures, are being made. In fact, everywhere in the world - whether openly or by default - a state of emergency has been declared. According to the classics of political thought, and in particular Carl Schmitt, this means the establishment of a regime of dictatorship. The sovereign, according to Schmitt, is he who makes the decision in an emergency situation (Ernstfall), and today this is the state. However, it should not be forgotten that today’s state has until the altogether recent last moment been based on the principles of liberal democracy, capitalism, and the ideology of human rights. In other words, this state is, in some sense, deciding on the liquidation of its own philosophical and ideological basis (even if such are for now formalized, temporary measures, the Roman Empire still began with the temporary dictatorship of Caesar, which gradually became permanent). Thus, the state is rapidly mutating, just as the virus itself is mutating, and the state is following the coronavirus in this constantly evolving struggle, which is taking the situation ever further from the point of global liberal democracy. All the extant borders which until yesterday seemed to be erased or half-erased are once again gaining fundamental meaning - not only for those who are going to cross them, but also for those who simply have managed in time to return to their country. At the same time, in larger countries this fragmentation is being carried over to individual regions, where states of emergency are leading to the establishment of their own, regional dictatorships, which in turn will be strengthened as communication with the center becomes more difficult. Such fragmentation will continue all the way down to small towns and even individual households, where forced closure will open up new horizons and volumes of domestic violence.

The state is taking upon itself the mission of fighting the coronavirus under certain conditions, but is waging this fight in already different circumstances. Over the course of this mission, all state institutions related to law, legality and economy are being transformed. Thus, the very introduction of quarantine completely overturns the logic of the market, according to which only the balance of supply and demand and the agreements concluded between employer and employee can regulate the relations between them. Bans on working for hygienic reasons are irrevocably collapsing the entire construction of capitalism. The suspension of freedom of

movement, assembly and democratic procedures is blocking the institutions of political democracy and paralyzing individual freedoms.

Post-liberal dictatorship

Over the course of this epidemic, a new state is emerging which is beginning to function with new rules. It is very likely that in the process of the state of emergency there will be a shift of power from formal rulers to technical and technological functionaries, e.g., the military, epidemiologists, and institutions especially created for such extreme circumstances. The physical threat which the virus poses to leaders is forcing them to be placed in special conditions that are not always compatible with full control over situations. As legal norms are suspended, new algorithms of behavior and new practices are beginning to be deployed. Thus is born the dictatorial state, which, unlike the liberal-democratic state, has completely different goals, foundations, principles and axioms. In this case, the ""world government"" is dissolved, because any supranational strategy loses all meaning. Power is rapidly moving to an ever lower level - but not to society and not to citizens, but to the military-technological and medical-sanitary level. A radically new rationality is gaining force - not the rationale of democracy, freedom, the market and individualism, but that of pure survival, for which responsibility is assumed by a subject combining direct power and the possession of technical, technological, and medical logistics. Moreover, in the network society, such is based on a system of total surveillance excluding any kind of privacy.

Thus, if at one end we have the virus as the subject of transformation, then at the other end we have military-medical surveillance and punitive dictatorship fundamentally differing in all parameters from the state that we knew until yesterday. It is not at all guaranteed that such a state, in its fight against the secular ""plague gods”, will precisely coincide with the borders of existing national entities. Since there will be no ideology or politics beyond the straightforward logic of survival, centralization itself will lose its meaning and its legitimacy.

From civil society to ""naked life”

Here once again let us recall the ""naked life"" of Giorgio Agamben, who in a similar vein and based on Schmitt's ideas on the ""state of emergency"" analyzed the situation in Nazi concentration camps, where the dehumanization of people attained the extreme, under which the ""naked life"" revealed itself. The “naked life” is not human life, but some other life that is beyond the limits of self-consciousness, personality, individuality, rights, and so on. Hence why Agamben has been more radical than others and opposed the measures taken against the coronavirus, preferring even death to the introduction of a state of emergency. He clearly saw that even a small step in this direction will change the entire structure of the world order. Entering the stage of dictatorship is easy, but exiting it is sometimes impossible.

The ""naked life” is the victim of the virus. It is not people, families, citizens, or private owners. Here there is neither one nor many. There is only the fact of infection, which can turn anyone - including oneself - into an other, and therefore into the enemy of ""naked life.” And it is fighting this other, ""naked life"" that grants dictatorship the new status of the subject. Then, society itself, at the mercy of dictatorship, will be turned into “naked life” organized by the dictatorship in accordance with its own peculiar rationality. Out of fear of the coronavirus, people are ready to go for any of the steps of those who have taken upon themselves responsibility for the state of emergency.

Thus, the fundamental split between the healthy and the sick, considered by Michel Foucault in his book ""Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison”, becomes even more impassable of a line than all the oppositions of the classical ideologies of Modernity, e.g., between the bourgeoisie and proletariat, the Aryans and Jews, the liberals and “enemies of the open society”, etc., and will see its dividing line set between the poles of the “naked life” and “medical technologists”, who have in their hands all the instruments of violence, surveillance, and authority. The difference between the already sick and the not yet sick which at first justified the new dictatorship will be erased, and the dictatorship of virologists, which has built new legitimacy on the basis of this distinction, will create a completely new model.

The new dictatorship is neither fascism nor communism

This situation will seem to many to be reminiscent of fascism or communism, but these parallels are imaginary. Both fascism and communism represented types of “civil society”, albeit totalitarian ones, with pronounced ideologies which guaranteed civil rights - not to all, but to the significant and, de facto, overwhelming majority of their citizens. Liberalism, by reducing all identities down to the level of the individual, paved the way and created the preconditions for a special type of post-liberal dictatorship that, unlike communism and fascism, should have no ideology at all, insofar as it will have no reason to persuade, mobilize, or ""seduce"" the element of the “naked life"". The ""naked life” is already consciously ready to surrender to dictatorship, regardless of what it promises or insists on. The structures of such a dictatorship will be built on the basis of the fact that it opposes the virus, not on the basis of ideas and preferences. The military-medical hygienic dictatorship will be characterized by a post-liberal logic, for which the only operation will be rational treatment of the ""naked life"", the bearers of which have no rights at all and no identity. This order will be built along the infected vs. healthy watershed, and this dual code will be as powerful as it is obvious, with no need for any justification or argumentation.

Artificial Intelligence and its enemies

Here the following consideration comes to mind: in the carriers of such a post-liberal anti-virus dictatorship, we see virtually no properly human traits. Any humanity would only hinder the most effective operation on the ""naked life"", and would thus represent a restless, trembling,

survival-at-all-costs-seeking chaos. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence, abstract mechanical calculation, would cope best with this task. In military-medical dictatorship we see a distinct cybernetic dimension, something machine-like and mechanical. If the ""naked life"" is chaos, then there must be a cold mathematical order at the other pole. And from now on, its only legitimization will be not the consent of society, which loses everything but its survival instinct, but the very criterion of its ability to make balanced logical decisions without being affected by superfluous emotions and passions. Therefore, even if a military-medical hygienic dictatorship is established by people, sooner or later its main bearers will be machines.

There will be no return

Several conclusions can be drawn from this very preliminary analysis of the near future - the future that has already begun:

1. It is impossible to go back to the world order that existed only recently and which seemed so familiar and natural that no one thought about its ephemerality. Liberalism either did not reach its natural end and the establishment of a ""world government"", or nihilistic collapse was its original goal, merely covered by increasingly less convincing and increasingly perverse ""humanist"" decor. Proponents of philosophical ""accelerationism"" speak of ""Black Enlightenment,"" emphasizing this dark, nihilistic aspect of liberalism as representing merely the accelerated movement of man toward the abyss of post-humanism. But in any case, instead of ""world government"" and total democracy, we are entering an era of new fragmentation, of ""closed societies"" and radical dictatorship, perhaps exceeding Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet gulag.

2. The end of globalization will not mean, however, a simple transition to the Westphalian system, to realism and a system of closed trade states (Fichte). Such would require the well- defined ideology that existed in early Modernity, but which was completely eradicated in late Modernity, and especially in Postmodernity. The demonization of anything remotely resembling “nationalism” or “fascism” has led to the total rejection of national identities, and now the severity of the biological threat and its crude physiological nature makes national myths superfluous. The military-medical dictatorship does not need additional methods to motivate the masses, and moreover, nationalism only enhances the dignity, self-consciousness and civil feeling of society which contradict the rules of the ""naked life"". For the society to come, there are only two criteria - healthy and sick. All other forms of identity, including national ones, have no meaning. Approximately the same was true for communism, which was also a motivating ideology that mobilized the consciousness of citizens to build a better society. All these ideologies are archaic, meaningless, redundant and counterproductive in the fight against coronavirus. Therefore, it would be wrong to see any ""new fascism"" or ""new communism"" in the impending post-liberal paradigm. It will be something else.

 

3. It cannot be ruled out that this new stage will affect so greatly the life of humankind or what will remain of it that, having passed through all these trials and tribulations, mankind will be ready to accept any form of power, any ideology, and any order that will weaken the terror of the Artificial Intelligence-military-medical dictatorship. And then, in a cycle, we cannot rule out a return to the project of ""world government"", but this will already be on a completely different basis, because society will be irreversibly changed over the period of “quarantine"". It will no longer be the choice of ""civil society"", but the cry of ""naked life”, which will recognize any authority that can offer deliverance from the horror that has occurred. This would be the right time for what Christians call the ""Antichrist"" to appear.

Exaggeration and the liquidation of leaders

Is such an analytical forecast too much of a dramatized exaggeration? I think it is quite realistic, although, of course, ""nobody knows the time"", and in any situation everything might be postponed for some time. The epidemic could end abruptly and a ",1,

The State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily.

The State argues that coronavirus patients admitted at hospitals only have their deaths delayed and infect many others while receiving care at the hospital.

China has been under criticism for human rights violations and organizations have questioned China’s approach in dealing with the Coronavirus outbreak and it is believed the country has already killed many of its coronavirus patients. The State mentioned in a document to the court that the country may lose its entire citizens if the few affected patients do not sacrifice their lives to save health workers and a billion others as there is no hope in sight in the fight against the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it needs $1 billion to fight coronavirus outside China.

Countries around the world are starting to cut ties with China and pull their citizens out of the crisis-hit Hubei region, where the virus emerged in the city of Wuhan.

Hong Kong’s leader today held a press conference during which she wore a face mask and said the city would stop all high-speed trains and ferries to the mainland, halve the number of flights and stop giving visas to visitors from China.

459,Ilhan Omar unveils bill to cancel rent and mortgage payments amid pandemic | US news | The Guardian,Sophie Kasakove,"The Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar has unveiled a bill that would cancel rent and mortgage payments for millions of Americans struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic. Under the legislation announced on Friday, landlords and mortgage holders would be able to have losses covered by the federal government. The program would extend for a month beyond the end of the national emergency, which was declared on 13 March, and would be made retroactive to cover April payments. The proposal comes amid an unprecedented housing crisis: 31% of Americans in rental accommodation could not pay rent at the beginning of this month. Millions have lost their jobs since. Federal answers have been limited. The Cares Act stimulus package included $12bn for Department of Housing and Urban Development programs targeting homelessness and rental assistance. But those funds do little to address the needs of millions of Americans who now find themselves on the edge of acute housing insecurity. National housing groups have called for more funding for rental relief. The National Low Income Housing Coalition estimates it would cost about $76.1bn over 12 months to provide relief to the 11.5 million people who are already or soon will become severely housing cost-burdened. The group is demanding $100bn in emergency solutions grants towards short-term rental assistance. But many housing advocates are concerned that such assistance would fail to provide the long-term protection needed to prevent mass evictions. A federal eviction moratorium established through the Cares Act extends only through mid-May, prohibiting evictions within properties with federally backed mortgages. Without an enforcement mechanism, or a clear way for tenants to find out if their property is covered, evictions have continued. Omarâ€™s bill seeks to tie federal funding to clear renter protections. In order to receive funds, landlords and lenders would be required to follow a set of fair renting and lending practices for five years. These terms would prohibit rent increases, evictions without just cause, discrimination against voucher holders and more. Any owner or mortgagee who breaks the terms would be subject to a fine. Perhaps most ambitiously, the legislation seeks to establish a fund to finance the purchase of private rental properties by not-for-profits, public housing authorities, community land trusts and state and local governments. The legislation was developed with grassroots organizations including Peopleâ€™s Action, the Center for Popular Democracy (CPD) and PolicyLink. Such groups hope to introduce the kind of solutions they wanted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Dianne Enriquez, CPD housing campaign coordinator, said the 2008 crisis wiped out â€œmillions of dollars in generational wealthâ€, particularly in black and brown communities, when people lost their homes. â€œIt created a devastation that we have not recovered from in the 12 years since,â€ she said, adding that as a result, â€œwe are now a majority renter nationâ€. In New York, statewide tenant coalition Housing Justice for All is aiming to organize a million renters to withhold rent and compel the governor, Andrew Cuomo, to cancel rent and mortgage payments. Tenants are also organizing in Philadelphia and California, where thousands have pledged to withhold rent on 1 May. Omarâ€™s bill proposes â€œan amazing way to use the federal stimulus package to not just provide direct relief but the long-term transformation of a real-estate market thatâ€™s based on speculation and private profit to a housing situation that prioritizes homesâ€, said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator at Housing Justice for All. â€œIt provides a pathway to a different ownership structure that doesnâ€™t rely on eviction and rent hikes to make money.â€",0,

102,21 million Chinese died of coronavirus – US intelligence officials intercept data,Đọc tiếng việt,"A new data intercepted by the United States reveals that 21 million people died in China from December 2019 to March 2020, US intelligence officials conclude in a classified report for the Trump administration.

The Intelligence report stated that at least 20.9 million of the deaths were linked to coronavirus.

According to the US, the intercepted data that shows that China underreported its coronavirus infections and deaths was validated for a second time when it tallied with a data released by Beijing authorities. Beijing announced on March 19 that over 21 million cell phone accounts in China were canceled in the past three months while 840,000 landlines were closed.

China had reported little over 81,000 infections with 3,300 deaths.

An earlier intelligence report released by the US that China hid scale of the outbreak was quickly rejected by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. Hua said the country had been “open and transparent” about the extent of the outbreak before accusing Washington of trying to “shift the blame.”

But US officials say the report has been authenticated and has been confirmed that the closing of the phones numbers were as result of deaths caused by coronavirus. “Cell phones are an indispensable part of life in China and its only closed when the user is dead”, the report said.

“The digitization level is very high in China. People can’t survive without a cell phone,” Tang Jingyuan, a U.S.-based China Affairs commentator told The Epoch Times on March 21. “Dealing with the government for pensions and social security, buying train tickets, shopping… no matter what people want to do, they are required to use cell phones.”

“The Chinese regime requires all Chinese use their cell phones to generate a health code. Only with a green health code are Chinese allowed to move in China now,” Tang said. “It’s impossible for a person to cancel his cell phone.”

China introduced mandatory facial scans on Dec. 1, 2019 to confirm the identity of the person who registered the phone. As early as Sept. 1, 2010, China required all cell phone users to register the phone with their real identification (ID), by which the state can control people’s speech via its large-scale monitoring system.

Furthermore, Chinese people have to bundle their bank accounts and social security account with their cell phone because all these service’s Apps can detect the phone’s SIM card and then check with the state’s database to make sure the number belongs to the person.

Beijing first launched cell phone-based health codes on March 10. All people in China have to install a cell phone app and register their personal health information. Then the app can generate a QR code, which is possible in three colors, to classify people’s health level. Red means the person has an infectious disease. Yellow means the person might have an infectious disease. Green means the person doesn’t have an infectious disease.

21 Million Cell Phone Accounts Closed

China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced the quantities of phone users in each province in February on March 19. Compared with the previous announcement, which was released on Dec. 18, 2019 for the data in November 2019, both cell phone users and landline users dropped dramatically. In the same period the year before, the number of accounts increased.

The number of cell phone users decreased from 1.600957 billion to 1.579927 billion, which is 21.03 million less. Landline users dropped from 190.83 million to 189.99 million, which is 0.84 million less.

In February 2019, the number increased. According to MIIT’s announcements on March 26, 2019 and Dec. 20, 2018, the cell phone users increased in February 2019 from 1.5591 billion to 1.5835 billion, which is 24.37 million more. The landline users raised from 183.477 million to 190.118 million, which is 6.641 million more.

According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the country’s population at the end of 2019 was 4.67 million larger than 2018, and reached 1.40005 billion.

The 2020 decrease in landline users may be due to the nationwide quarantine in February, during which small businesses were shut down. But the decrease in cell phone users can’t be explained in this way.

According to the operation data of all three Chinese cell phone carriers, cell phone accounts increased in December 2019, but dropped steeply in 2020.

China Mobile is the largest carrier, and holds about 60 percent of the Chinese cell phone market. It reported that it lost 7.254 million cell phone accounts in February, and 0.862 million in January. But in Dec. 2019, it gained 3.732 million more users.",1,

All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical facts, are forward-looking statements for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution to unitholders and expected expenses, including capital expenditures. The anticipated distribution is based, in large part, on the amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from COERT Holdings 1 LLC (the Sponsor) with respect to the relevant period. The amount of such cash received or expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay distributions) has been and will continue to be directly affected by the volatility in commodity prices, which have declined sharply in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent announcement of planned production increases by Saudi Arabia and could remain low for an extended period of time. Continued low oil and natural gas prices will reduce profits to which the Trust is entitled, which will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses of the Trust, reserves for anticipated future expenses and the continuing transition process following the sale of the Underlying Properties to the Sponsor. In addition, future monthly capital expenditures may exceed the average levels experienced in 2019 and prior periods.

The May U.S. WTI contract fell $15.91, or 87.1%, to $2.36 a barrel at 1:25 p.m (1725 GMT) after touching an all-time low of $2.26. Brent LCOc1 was down $1.76, or 6.3%, to $26.32 a barrel. The June WTI contract CLc2 is trading more actively at a much higher level of $22.25 a barrel. The spread between May and June was more than $19, the widest in history for the two nearest monthly contracts. Investors bailed out of the May contract ahead of expiry later on Monday because of lack of demand for the actual oil. When a futures contract expires, traders must decide whether to take delivery of the oil or roll their positions into another futures contract for a later month. Usually this process is relatively uncomplicated, but this time, there are very few counterparties that will buy from investors and take delivery of the oil. Storage is filling quickly at Cushing in Oklahoma, which is where the crude is delivered. [EIA/S] â€œThere is no bid for May WTI as there is no buyer and we have yet to see a significant reduction is supply at Cushing to offset it,â€ said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at United ICAP. Refiners are processing much less crude than normal, so hundreds of millions of barrels have gushed into storage facilities worldwide. Traders have hired vessels just to anchor them and fill them with the excess oil. A record 160 million barrels is sitting in tankers around the world. U.S. Crude stockpiles at Cushing rose 9% in the week to April 17, totaling around 61 million barrels, market analysts said, citing a Monday report from Genscape. â€œThe storage is too full for speculators to buy this contract and the refiners are running at low levels because we havenâ€™t lifted stay-at-home orders in most states,â€ said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. â€œThereâ€™s not a lot of hope that things are going to change in 24 hours.â€ Many investors may have been misled by what appeared to be a very low oil price and did not consider the monthly expiry of futures contracts, Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said. Prices have been pressured for weeks with the coronavirus outbreak hammering demand while Saudi Arabia and Russia fought a price war and pumped more. The two sides agreed more than a week ago to cut supply by 9.7 million bpd, but that will not quickly reduce the global glut. Brent oil prices have collapsed around 60% since the start of the year, while U.S. crude futures have fallen around 95%, to levels well below break-even costs necessary for many shale drillers. This has led to drilling halts and drastic spending cuts. Weak global economic data also pressured prices. The German economy is in severe recession and recovery is unlikely to be quick as coronavirus-related restrictions could stay in place for an extended period, the Bundesbank said. Japanese exports declined the most in nearly four years in March as U.S.-bound shipments, including cars, fell at their fastest rate since 2011. The mood in other markets was also cautious as the first-quarter earnings season gets underway. Analysts expect STOXX 600 companies to post a 22% plunge in earnings, which would represent the steepest decline since the 2008 global financial meltdown, IBES data from Refinitiv showed. Halliburton Co (HAL.N), which generates most of its oil business in North America, joined its larger rival Schlumberger in taking impairment hits in the first quarter and issued a bleak outlook for North America. Canada, the worldâ€™s fourth-largest oil producer, has begun to rein in production, but analysts say the biggest cuts lie ahead. The Russian energy ministry has told domestic oil producers to reduce oil output by around 20% from their average February levels, two industry sources told Reuters, which would bring Moscow in line with its commitment under a global deal.

458,"Puff, don't pass: The future of weed after coronavirus",Chris Taylor,"Throughout the 2010s, marijuana was on a roll. Dozens of states and a couple of countries legalized it for recreational use; dozens more belatedly allowed medicinal use. VCs circled a fledgling industry that found novel ways to reach for ever more respectability. Estimated sales worldwide looked set to reach $17 billion in 2019, a jump of 38 percent, even as a crisis sparked by knock-off vape pens hobbled one of its main categories. Then came the 2020 coronavirus pandemic...and in some ways, marijuana was on more of a roll than ever. In states like California, which designated its dispensaries an essential service, a growing mountain of evidence suggests sales have shot up since March 1. No wonder: Much of the cannabis customer base is stuck at home, anxious and bored at the same time. Those who need to go out to work are even more stressed out. Guess which plant has the best track record of relieving such afflictions. WATCH: Is cannabis a gateway drug?  But buried in the figures was another story. Demand for edibles is up across the board; sales of smokeable and vapeable products are relatively flat even in an era of panic-buying and hoarding. The fact that COVID-19 is a respiratory disease gave smokers pause; experts advise abstaining from smoke or vapor to put your lungs in their healthiest place, should they need to fight off the fast-spreading virus. And 4/20/20, a date so widely anticipated that weed companies timed their product launches to it, was marked by officials spreading warnings like this one from rapper E40 telling fans not to celebrate because ""the game needs us, you feel me?"" A heartfelt message from the Ambassador of the Bay Area, @E40.Donâ€™t gather for 4/20. Stay home, stay safe. Protect your family and your community. pic.twitter.com/MWHAIVpJeG â€” London Breed (@LondonBreed) April 17, 2020 So how does the game play out for pot? Where does weed world go from here? Nobody knows, just as we don't know how long the COVID-19 crisis or its associated stay-at-home orders will last. Forecasts for the second quarter, because that's a thing pot companies do now, have all been put in the shredder. But here we use the business world's favorite strategic tool, scenario planning, to help us think about four possible futures for the cannabis industry post-pandemic. Everything goes back to the way it was, sooner rather than later, and the fall 2020 harvest is largely unaffected. Cannabis consumers resume exactly the same smoking and vaping behaviors as before, sharing their joints and pipes with no fear of spreading the virus through dreaded droplets. New users visit dispensaries at the same brisk clip, unconcerned by respiratory worries. This seems, in some ways, the least likely scenario. No matter how long stay-at-home orders last, the need to avoid large gatherings will likely remain while we wait for a vaccine that isn't expected before 2021. Famous weed-friendly festivals won't be around to reinforce the social norms of the 2010s, either. Burning Man was effectively canceled just last week, with no word on when the next one will be. Coachella was postponed until October; if it is canceled outright, we may start to find ourselves in cultural sea-change territory. Edible sales are up, up, up: This is the one constant in the 420 marketing pitches hitting my inbox. Cannabis data intelligence company Headset reports a 13 percent rise in sales of weed-laced beverages in food since February. Indeed, edibles have much to commend them to coronavirus-panicked buyers â€” not least the fact that you can store the stuff for months in the freezer (if it's gummies or candies, at least). If that sales trend continues at the same pace, and public health officials continue spreading the don't-smoke-or-vape message, we could be looking at a world where the majority of the weed harvest goes to creating cannabis butters and oils and other edible formats. Such a shift in production would create its own center of gravity, for example favoring  varieties known to produce a clearer-headed, more focused high. As any connoisseur knows, edible highs don't just take longer to kick in; they're qualitatively different from their smoked counterparts. But that also leads us to the main problem with an edible future scenario: A lot of consumers just don't like their edible experience, finding it too spacey and dissociative. Meanwhile, one FDA study (from way back in 1973!) suggests, counterintuitively, that marijuana smoke in small quantities causes the lungs to expand rather than constrict ""and, unlike opiates, does not cause central respiratory depression."" As the science of COVID-19 and what exactly it does to the lungs advances, and the panic simmers down, the public health advice may shift. But even if it doesn't change, there are more ways to consume marijuana other than via your lungs or your gullet. One promising area I wrote about in 2018: the rise of nasal spray weed such as Verra Wellness nasal mist. With an experience rather like using Flonase, these sprays combine the best of both edible and smokeable worlds. The onset is fast, the high is (apparently) very clear-headed and you're not affecting your lungs one way or another. What's not to love? The activity at the center of cannabis culture â€” standing in a circle of friends old or new, passing a joint or a pipe â€” vanished overnight thanks to social distancing. In this scenario, it's pretty much gone for good, and a whole generation is averse to ever doing it again. Among those who remember the coronavirus crisis of 2020-2022, passing around something you put your mouth on is seen as weird and unhygienic. Counterintuitively, this would lead to a boost for cannabis sales as everyone now has to bring their own stuff to the party. So the public health message is likely to be reinforced at retail level, by dispensaries and head shops alike: Don't rely on others, you irresponsible mooch. Buy your own pipe or pen, and you'll potentially save a life. How to pass the J in 2020.LOAD. SMOKE. ASH. ðŸŽ¯ðŸ’¨https://t.co/qjNN9pJ21a pic.twitter.com/fRj51awnjg â€” thedartco (@thedartco) April 1, 2020 A milder form of this scenario, as suggested in the Dart ad above: Perhaps joint smokers will still share, but each bring their own cigarette holders. Then again, that still requires touching the same joint, which may be a no-no long into the future. The coronavirus quarantine turns out to have been the perfect breeding ground for new users. They don't stop when they come out of lockdown; in fact, they start preferring it to alcohol as a midday or post-work treat. Bars and restaurants, already on the ropes, take a permanent hit. Author and researcher Steven Kotler called this a generational shift, irreversible even before the pandemic. ""Look at Silicon Valley, they're all getting high on their lunch break,"" he told me last year. This makes a lot of sense. Alcohol sales may have spiked at the beginning of the lockdown, but many drinkers are likely to discover â€” perhaps after one too many work-from-home hangovers â€” that it is exactly the wrong drug for this moment. Drinking is a group activity that promotes expansive, outgoing behavior; drink at home night after night and your friends are rightly concerned. THC, on the other hand, is on home turf here. It makes the most humdrum life moments seem interesting and important, and puts you safely to sleep better than booze. It pairs well with eating snacks, cleaning your house, watching Netflix and playing the strolling flaneur around your neighborhood at a friendly but careful distance. We are, in a sense, all stoners now. Will our stay-at-home months be enough to tilt the scales on society's drug of choice? Reports from the front lines of the west coast suggest the practice is spreading, um, virally. SF-based weed delivery platform Sava says a whopping 66 percent of its customers are first-timers. Even in the most mature weed markets, Colorado and Washington, Headset reports ""dramatic spikes"" in sales mid-March â€” though they dropped back to regular levels at the end of the month, suggesting panic-buying may have been in effect. Regardless, much depends on states and countries that were considering or had previously rejected legalization. The widespread unemployment we're already seeing will leave millions looking for forms of government-sanctioned solace; never forget that the U.S. started reversing its alcohol prohibition at the outset of the Great Depression. Governors, meanwhile, will be scrambling to plug holes in income tax and sales tax revenue. Luckily, ""If all states legalized and taxed marijuana, states could collectively expect to raise between $5 billion and $18 billion per year,"" says the nonprofit Tax Foundation (which usually opposes greater taxation). In other words, we may soon be living in a world that can't afford not to legalize weed â€” especially not as it becomes the dominant downtime activity of the 2020s.",0,

231,UN Refuses to Send Coronavirus Funds to Pro-Life Nation Unless It Legalizes Abortions,MICAIAH BILGER ,"The United Nations is using coronavirus aid to pressure Ecuador to legalize the killing of unborn babies in abortions, pro-life leaders in the country said this month.

The Catholic News Agency reports the country’s Ministry of Foreign Relations and Human Mobility recently asked for $46.4 million in aid from the UN Humanitarian Response Plan COVID-19.

Within that funding package, however, is a goal to “maintain continuity of maternal, neonatal and children’s health and other sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic,” including abortions, according to the report.

“[Our] fear is that our highest authority in Ecuador will even consider accepting this economic shakedown of $46 million in exchange for the lives of thousands of unborn children,” Martha Villafuerte of the pro-life Guayaquil Family Network told ACI Prensa.

The Guayaquil Family Network and other pro-life organizations recently began a petition urging President Lenin Moreno to reject the abortion agenda within the aid, according to the report.

“It goes against the Constitution, specifically article 45, which guarantees the right to life from conception, a right that was ratified last September 17 at the plenary session of the National Assembly,” Villafuerte said.

Here’s more from the report:

The citizen petition says that “in the face of the COVID-19 drama, the United Nations has offered to send humanitarian aid to Ecuador, but the aid is not free, since in various sections of the document it is explained that said aid is conditional on Ecuador legalizing abortion.”

“And it seems it has already begun to produce results because Ecuador is one of the 59 countries that in the midst of the pandemic has already committed to promote abortion,” the petition adds, referring to a May 6 joint declaration signed by a number of countries, including Ecuador “to protect sexual and reproductive health and rights and to promote gender-responsiveness” during the pandemic. Villafuerte said the UN plan would give Ecuador $46.4 million, but it would require $3 million of that aid to be used to train “health personnel on safe, legal abortion and post-abortion care.”

Some lawmakers are speaking out against the abortion agenda, too.

“Unbelievable! The UN conditions ‘safe legal abortion’ in its humanitarian support plan for Ecuador,” Assemblyman Héctor Yépez wrote on Twitter. “While we all want to save lives, some insist on eliminating the lives of unborn girls and boys.”

The United Nations has faced international criticism for pushing abortions as part of its response to the coronavirus.

Jonathan Abbamonte of the Population Research Institute wrote more about it earlier this month:

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has also been urging governments to ensure uninterrupted access to abortion during the pandemic. An interim technical brief recently issued by UNFPA calls on governments to: “Ensure women’s and girls’ choices and rights to sexual and reproductive health is respected regardless of their COVID-19 status, including access to contraception, emergency contraception, safe abortion to the full extent of the law.” The technical brief also advises governments to “encourage” women who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection to seek abortion services “to the full extent of the law.”

This seems a backhanded way of saying that, when women come to African health clinics to be treated for the coronavirus, they should also be propagandized about the benefits of abortion. Health care in Africa has often been directly tied to population control programs in this way.

The WHO also faced heavy criticism from pro-life leaders this spring when it falsely claimed abortion is an essential service during the coronavirus pandemic.

President Donald Trump stopped giving United States tax dollars to the United Nations Population Fund in 2017, and, in April, he halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO).",1,
225,The Modern-Day Cult of Corona: The Imposition of a “Multilayer Control Grid”. The “Lock Step” Future of Humanity?,Helen Buyniski,"Omnipotence and Omniscience in the 21st century

The contact-tracing platforms – both digital and human-based – being rolled out around the world have their philosophical roots in religious rites of confession, cross-bred with the police-state logic of the National Security Agency (“if you haven’t done anything wrong, you have nothing to fear”) and coupled with the religious notion of an all-seeing, all-knowing deity.

All deviation from lockdown dogma is logged and reported, including consorting with known heretics, and this Panopticon – attacked when it debuted in China allegedly as totalitarian police-state control – is now being embraced in western media as the work of benevolent governments concerned with citizen welfare. While this transformation was laid out chillingly in ‘Lock Step,’ a hypothetical future outlined in 2010 in the Rockefeller Foundation and Global Business Network’s “Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development,” any discussion of predictive programming is off-limits.

Indeed, Corona Cultists are encouraged to cut off their “conspiracy theorist” relatives, because, in the words of Canadian broadcaster CBC, “conspiracies can be just as infectious, just as dangerous as a virus – so you have to guard against them.”

Parents in Wales are being warned that conspiracy theorists are a greater threat than pedophiles on the internet. Compounding the seriousness of wrongthink, the WHO has popularized the term “infodemic” – implying ideas are as dangerous to one’s health as pathogens – and recommended a “vaccine for misinformation.”

Soon, the Corona Cultist will no longer have to self-report their symptoms on a Facebook survey or confess their sins to a contact-tracer. Massachusetts Institute of Technology has developed clothing with embedded sensors to monitor the wearer’s vital signs. Enabled by the 5G networks being fast-tracked while any potential opposition is locked down, these sensors will communicate in real time with surveillance smart grids, pinpointing the offender and alerting others to give them a wide berth, refuse to serve them, and eventually have them “neutralized.”

Their bank account may be frozen until they return home, or even debited a certain fine based on the degree of disobedience (“that’ll be 20 Hail Bills…or $20 per minute outside the home, your choice”).

Eventually, these sensors will be implanted inside the body – in what sounds like the plot of a science fiction dystopia, Microsoft secured a patent in March for a system that mines cryptocurrency based on physiological signals, theoretically permitting the corporation to ‘reward’ users based on desirable responses to certain stimuli. While the example they gave was banal – a reward for watching an advertisement – it’s no great leap to imagine equivalent punishments for those who respond with disgust to the ruling class’ propaganda.

The all-knowing, all-seeing God micromanaging His followers, a religious trope that has been used to keep large populations in line for millennia, has finally been realized in the form of the Covid-19 police state. Big Brother wields technology as both carrot – gently shepherding His flock toward transhumanist perfection by offering a facsimile of freedom in return for downloading an app, accepting a “quantum dot tattoo,” or showing a “certificate of immunity” on demand – and stick, digitally and literally imprisoning those who deviate from His shining future. A breathtakingly wealthy coalition of billionaires and their pet statesmen have seized their own slice of the divine by appointing themselves Big Brother’s agents on earth. From the messianic glow of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen as she solicits money from cash-strapped European nations, to the aforementioned sweater-vested Gates channelling Nostradamus with predictions of “Pandemic Two,” to second-generation New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (whose PR people have laid it on thick with hashtags like #Cuomosexual and #CuomoForPresident even as his state leads the world in infections and deaths and his policies of mandating nursing homes accept Covid-19-positive patients literally “kill Grandma”) epitomizing “New York Tough” by acting out #resistance to Trump even as his brother was supposedly laid low by the virus, there’s no end of ruling-class Heroes™ basking in the admiration of the Corona Cultists, who offer up their (and everyone else’s) rights on a silver platter, never to be seen again. Can constant surveillance stop the virus?

There’s nothing wrong with clinging to ritual in a time of uncertainty – certainly hand-washing doesn’t have a downside, presuming one stops short of wearing the skin off one’s hands. But when that ritual harms others, it must be questioned. Covid-19 zealots would argue that they have science on their side, but the science is far from settled on the effectiveness of social distancing and sweeping economic shutdowns.

Pseudoscience on a rampage

As social media censors tighten the screws on what information is permitted to enter the public sphere, it becomes increasingly difficult to pretend the Cult of Corona is based on science.

Actual science relies upon constant inquiry, testing, and hypothesizing, and even those claims generally attested to by its practitioners are considered “theories” as opposed to unchangeable truths. Science-as-religion, on the other hand, denounces those who put forth dissenting theories as heretics, using slurs like “quack,” “charlatan,” and “anti-vaxxer” to marginalize, for example, medical practitioners who heal people without the use of pharmaceutical drugs.

The social media platforms’ decision to unilaterally deplatform content that contradicts the WHO’s narrative is anti-scientific in the extreme, sacrificing the spirit of inquiry for the strictures of groupthink. It’s rendered even more Kafkaesque due to continuing shifts in the WHO’s own narrative, which has changed as more is learned about the virus (as scientific understanding tends to do).

The idea that YouTube’s content moderators know better than a medical doctor how to treat Covid-19 would have been considered laughable just six months ago, yet Google’s video platform has repeatedly removed videos of licensed, practicing clinicians discussing their experiences.

A pair of “rogue” doctors in Bakersfield, California who held a lengthy press conference laying out their findings and questioning the wisdom of prolonged lockdowns – broadcast on a local network TV station – went viral, only for YouTube to remove nearly every copy while pundits denounced the pair as “coronavirus truthers.” Their video did not attempt to project their own experiences onto the world – indeed, where they did cite statistics outside of Bakersfield, they used “official” statistics from health authorities, in Sweden and elsewhere, to support their claim that the fatality rate was being significantly overestimated because most cases were asymptomatic. Their video was literally broadcast on “mainstream media,” an “authoritative source” in the eyes of YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. But its incompatibility with prevailing coronavirus dogma meant it had to be destroyed.

The orthodox narrative also jettisons long-accepted science about immunity. Vitamin D – obtained from sunlight absorbed through the skin – has been proven in study after study to be integral to a healthy immune system, and several recent studies have demonstrated its importance in surviving Covid-19 infection. Likewise, loneliness has been linked to diminished immune function and poor health in general, especially in elderly people (i.e. those most susceptible to Covid-19), and even those who are quite content with being alone are experiencing diminished immune stimulation due to not interacting with other people.

The link between isolation and ill health is so strong that even the media establishment has quietly acknowledged it, and solitary confinement is considered cruel and unusual punishment in many countries. No less than the World Economic Forum, co-organizer of the notorious Event 201 simulation that served as a dress rehearsal for Covid-19 itself, has called the stay-at-home orders that have confined more than half the world’s population to their homes “the world’s biggest psychological experiment.” The ruling-class conclave warned “we will pay the price” in a secondary mental-illness epidemic, one which its members – heavily invested in the pharmaceutical companies that are among the biggest winners of the pandemic – are no doubt poised to cash in on with antidepressants, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics aplenty. Nevertheless, questioning the wisdom of prolonged isolation in the form of extended lockdowns is still seen as anathema.

Deprogramming

To begin to free humanity from the influence of the Corona Cult, it’s important to understand how its programming took hold. Guilt – environmental guilt, racial guilt, class-based guilt – is the primary route of attack. The media establishment initially attempted to link the coronavirus outbreak to climate change, with even the Pope climbing on board the narrative, though no scientific basis exists to support it and it has since been somewhat de-emphasized. Heretics are repeatedly accused of prioritizing their own convenience over the health of society, especially its most vulnerable members – the elderly, the sick, even poor and non-white populations. Depending on the target audience, anti-lockdown heretics are said to be scientifically-illiterate “covidiots” or heartless monsters consigning the disadvantaged to die for capitalism. Guilt and shame are powerful conversion tools, and even those who remain unconverted are likely to hold their tongues in a sociological phenomenon known as the spiral of silence.

At the same time, humanity’s innate religious tendencies (present in even atheists – millennia of programming don’t vanish just because a person comes to the realization they live in a godless universe) – have been hijacked. It’s no coincidence that governments imposing lockdowns have singled out places of worship for particular animus – anyone attending religious services is presumably content enough with their god(s) that they’re unlikely to ditch their faith for a virus-venerating cult-come-lately. Constantly bombarded with messages of uncertainty and kept from communing with their usual faith, even people normally secure in their religion will reach for the stability the Corona Police State provides – authoritarianism’s flip side is paternalism, and comfort is found in the arms of Big Brother. Among the non-religious, liberal and libertarian populations alike are targeted with the weaponization of medical jargon – a simple “what’s the matter, you don’t believe in science?” sends weak-willed groupthinkers into shameful silence while their freedoms are methodically amputated.

It is supremely ironic that in this Inquisition, the “real” church has been sidelined. Aside from the Pope, who has wholeheartedly embraced the New Normal, a group of Catholic leaders recently issued a statement calling out governments, the media, and public health experts, denouncing the Covid-19 narrative as cover for “infringing on the rights of millions of people around the world.”

Cynical scholars of religious history might suggest they’re motivated by jealousy – “stop using dogma to control people, that’s our job!” – but their concerns are no less valid, and the feeling of envy cuts both ways. The single-minded determination of police to break up even those church services scrupulously observing social distancing with worshipers sitting isolated in their cars can only be explained by eschatological jealousy. To truly force the Cult of Corona down the throats of the people, the competition must be eliminated, whether it’s “traditional” religion or logic, reason and the (real) scientific method. Deprogramming the world from the Cult of Corona cannot be done by force – its backers have too much power, including total control of both establishment and social media. It must be approached strategically. Just as traditional “deprogrammers” will isolate a cult member from the group, reasoning there’s a much better chance of re-awakening the original personality when the person is not experiencing the pressures of groupthink, deprogramming Corona Cultists is best done one-on-one, keeping in mind that cultists will ferociously defend their dogma with thought-stopping techniques which can be extremely irritating to outsiders trying to convey dissenting information. Former “Moonie” Steven Hassan’s BITE model (above) describes how cults exert undue influence and is useful in approaching deprogramming.

The notion of deprogramming entire societies may seem daunting, but it is the only chance humanity has to retain some semblance of freedom and turn back from the dark path down which our species is heading.

311,"Stocks head for higher ground, oil stuck in a rut - Reuters",Marc Jones,"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe led world stock markets back to higher ground on Thursday as tentative moves to reopen parts of the some of its larger coronavirus-hit economies offset some truly stinking global economic numbers. Asian equities and U.S. futures had wilted earlier in the day after warnings of a Great Depression-style slump in the world economy, a record plunge in U.S. retail sales, oil near an 18-year low [O/R] and the prospect of a sky high jump in U.S. jobless claims later in the session. But the pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose over 1% in early trade, spurred by a drop in the virus death tolls in both Spain and Italy and reassuring statements from two of the continentâ€™s big budget airlines about their survival prospects. [.EU] Wall Street futures ESc1 recovered, too, and in the currency and bond markets both the dollar USD= and benchmark German Bund and U.S. Treasury yields shifted higher in the more 'risk-on' mood. [/FRX] [GVD/EUR] â€œWe have had this big wave of big announcements by governments and central banks and now we need to get into the nitty gritty of how it all works,â€ said AXA Investment Managers chief economist Gilles Moec. â€œWe need to see if it is working, how it is working and if we need to do more.â€ Markets may be seizing on the fact that policymakers, however reluctantly, are starting to allow stringent lockdowns to ease. Germany is proposing to reopen schools and some retailers starting May 4, while around 20 U.S. states spared the worst of the coronavirus pandemic may start reopening their economies by President Donald Trumpâ€™s May 1 target date. Firms are looking to restart as well. Volkswagen has said its factories in Germany and Slovakia will resume some production from April 20 with others following a week later. But the economic figures are dire. After the IMFâ€™s forecasts for this year, markets are expecting China to report on Friday that Q1 GDP contracted for the first time on record, and hopes for a quick rebound are fading fast. A Reuters survey showed that most Japanese firms feel stimulus announced so far are insufficient and Wednesdayâ€™s U.S. data also showed manufacturing output there dropping the most in over 74 years. Asia had had a difficult day as a result. Tokyoâ€™s Nikkei dropped 1.3% and MSCIâ€™s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS lost almost 1%, wiping out early week gains that had taken it to a one-month high. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar AUD=D3 fell to a one-week low and oil prices struggled to rise against the expectation of cratering demand. U.S. crude CLc1 sat at $20.22 per barrel, just over $1 above an 18-year low hit on Wednesday, and Brent crude LCOc1 rose 37 cents or 1.3% in European trade to $28.02 per barrel. The International Monetary Fund is predicting zero growth in Asia this year for the first time in 60 years, as exporters are pounded by slumping demand and anti-virus measures force consumers to stay home and shops to shut down. Benchmark indexes in Australia , Hong Kong .HSI and Shanghai .SSEC also posted falls between 0.4% and 1.3% and some emerging markets fell harder. â€œA recovery timeline...remains impossible to predict,â€ said Ronald Lam, chief customer officer at airline Cathay Pacific (0293.HK), which has slashed nearly all its passenger capacity and lost a fifth of its value this year.

55,The Coronavirus COVID-19 Pandemic: The Real Danger is “Agenda ID2020”,Peter Koenig,"It seems, the more there is written about the causes of the Coronavirus – the more the written analyses are overshadowed by a propaganda and fear-mongering hype. Questions for the truth and arguments for where to look for the origins and how the virus may have spread and how to combat it, are lost in the noise of wanton chaos. But isn’t that what the “Black Men” behind this intended pandemic want – chaos, panic, hopelessness, leading to human vulnerability – a people becoming easy prey for manipulation? Today WHO declared the coronavirus COVID-19 a “pandemic” – when there is not the slightest trace of a pandemic. A pandemic might be the condition, when the death to infection rate reaches more than 12%. In Europe, the death rate is about 0.4%, or less. Except for Italy which is a special case, where the peak of the death rate was 6% (see below for further analysis). After the pandemic has been officially declared, the next step may be – also at the recommendation either by WHO, or individual countries, “force vaccination”, under police and/or military surveillance. Those who refuse may be penalized (fines and / or jail – and force-vaccinated all the same).

If indeed force-vaccination will happen, another boAnonymousza for Big Pharma, people really don’t know what type of cocktail will be put into the vaccine, maybe a slow killer, that acts-up only in a few years – or a disease that hits only the next generation – or a brain debilitating agent, or a gene that renders women infertile …. all is possible – always with the aim of full population control and population reduction. In a few years’ time, one doesn’t know, of course, where the disease comes from. That’s the level of technology our bio-war labs have reached (US, UK, Israel, Canada, Australia…).

Another hypothesis, at this point only a hypothesis, but a realistic one, is that along with the vaccination – if not with this one, then possibly with a later one, a Anonymouso-chip may be injected, unknown to the person being vaccinated. The chip may be remotely charged with all your personal data, including bank accounts – digital money. Yes, digital money that’s what “they” are aiming at, so you really have no control any more over your health and other intimate data, but also over your earnings and spending. Your money could be blocked, or taken away – as a ‘sanction’ for misbehavior, for swimming against the stream. You may become a mere slave of the masters. Comparatively, feudalism may appear like a walk in the park.

It’s not for nothing that Dr. Tedros, DG of WHO, said a few days ago, we must move towards digital money, because physical paper and coin money can spread diseases, especially endemic diseases, like the coronavirus. A precursor for things to come? – Or for things already here? – In many Scandinavian countries cash is largely banned and even a bar of chocalate can be paid only electronically.

We are moving towards a totalitarian state of the world. This is part of Agenda ID2020 – and these steps to be implemented now – prepared since long, including by the coronavirus computer simulation at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore on 18 October 2019, sponsored by the WEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Bill Gates, one of the chief advocates of vaccinations for everybody, especially in Africa – is also a huge advocate of population reduction. Population reduction is among the goals of the elite within the WEF, the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Morgens – and a few more. The objective: fewer people (a small elite) can live longer and better with the reduced and limited resources Mother Earth is generously offering.

This had openly been propagated already in the 1960s and 70s by Henry Kissinger, Foreign Secretary in de Nixon Administration, a co-engineer of the Vietnam war, and main responsible for the semi-clandestine bombing of Cambodia, a genocide of millions of unarmed Cambodian civilians. Along with the CIA-Kissinger engineered coup on 9/11, 1973, in Chile, killing the democratically elected Salvador Allende and putting the military dictator Pinochet in power, Kissinger has committed war crimes. Today, he is a spokesman (so to speak) for Rockefeller and their  “Bilderberger Society”. Two weeks after the computer simulation at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, that “produced” (aka simulated) 65 million deaths (!), the COVID-19 virus first appeared in Wuhan. By now it is almost certain that the virus was brought to Wuhan from outside, most likely from a bio-war lab in the US. See also this and this. What is behind it all? – A total crackdown with artificially induced panic to the point where people are screaming “help, give us vaccinations, display police and military for our security” – or even if the public despair doesn’t go that far, it would be easy for the EU and US authorities to impose a military stage of siege for “health protection of the people”. In fact, CDC (Center for Disease Control in Atlanta), has already designed harshly dictatorial directives for a “health emergency”.

Along with forced vaccination, who knows what would be contained in the cocktail of ‘’mini-diseases” injected, and what their long-term effects might be. Similar to those of GMOs, where all sorts of germs could be inserted without us, the commons, knowing?

We may indeed be just at the beginning of the implementation of ID2020 – which includes, forced vaccination, population reduction and total digital control of everybody – on the way to One World Order – and global fiAnonymouscial hegemony – Full Spectrum DomiAnonymousce, as the PNAC (Plan for a New American Century) likes to call it.

A windfall for China. China has been purposely targeted for “economic destruction”, because of her rapidly advancing economy, an economy soon to overtake that of the now hegemon, the US of A, and because of China’s strong currency, the Yuan, also potentially overtaking the dollar as the world’s main reserve currency.

Both occurrences would mean the end of US domiAnonymousce over the world. The coronavirus disease, now in more than 80 countries, has crashed the stock markets, a decline of at least 20% over the last few weeks – and rising; the feared consequences from the virus of an economic slow-down, if not recession, has slashed petrol prices within about two weeks almost in half. However, without China’s central bank interference, the Yuan’s value vis-à-vis the dollar has been rather stable, at around 7 Yuan to the dollar. That means, the Chinese economy, despite COVID-19, is receiving still much trust around the globe.

Advice to China – buy all the US and European corporate shares you can at current rock-bottom prices from the stock markets that collapsed by a fifth or more, plus buy lots of oil futures. When the prices recover, you have not only made billions, probably trillions from the west, but you also may own or hold significant and influence-yielding amounts of shares in most of the largest US and European corporations – and will be able to help call the shots of their future endeavors.

There is however, one little silver lining oscillating at the horizon full of dark clouds. It could miraculously be an awakening of consciousness of a critical mass that could put an end to it all. Although, we seem to be far from such a miracle, somewhere in a hidden corner of our brain, we all have a spark of consciousness left. We have the spiritual capacity to abandon the disaster path of western neoliberal capitalism, and instead espouse solidarity, compassion and love for each other and for our society. That may be the only way to break the gridlock and doom of western egocentric greed.",1,
283,Coronavirus latest: â€˜We donâ€™t know if outbreak is contained in Chinaâ€™ warns economist  | World | News | Express.co.uk,Claire Anderson," Coronavirus, a flu-like infection, has rapidly spread in Italy as Austria is considering introducing border controls with the country. Chief Economist for Enodo Economics, Diana Choyleva, warned it isnâ€™t clear the outbreak is contained in China following the lockdown of Chinese cities including, Wuhan where it started. Ms Choyleva claimed it was suspicious China is â€œloweringâ€ itâ€™s emergency response levels. Speaking to Channel 4 News, Ms Choyleva said: â€œThe defining feature of where we are is what I call the great de-coupling; this all-encompassing political confrontation between China and the US. â€œThe coronavirus is only going to exacerbate that.â€ She continued: â€œThe supply chains are highly integrated. â€œThe immediate impact in economic terms is on supply chains.

The statement read: â€œThe virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife and the patients have been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres in Royal Liverpool Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital, London.â€ Governments are ramping up measures to battle a looming global pandemic of the coronavirus as the number of infections outside China, the source of the outbreak, for the first time surpassed those appearing inside the country. The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China. Much remains unknown about the virus but it is clear the ramifications of the world's second-biggest economy in lockdown for a month or more are vast.

443,Meghan and Harry plot Â£3m holiday home near Beckhams in Cotswolds | Royal | News | Express.co.uk,," The Duke and Duchess are believed to be building a three-bedroom home in the picturesque countryside. The site is close to one of the coupleâ€™s favourite retreats, a private membersâ€™ club called Soho Farmhouse. Harry and Meghan zipped away on romantic trips to the farmhouse at the start of their relationship, which invites people from creative fields to the Â£725-a-night venue. Photos show a site under construction near Soho Farmhouse, in Oxfordshire, and a secluded cottage that could have been knocked down to free-up space for the new home. Not only did the couple escape to the area for romantic retreats but Meghan also spent the weekend before marrying Harry on May 19, 2018 at the resort. A source told The Sun: â€œThis house will be their bolthole when they are in the UK. â€œIt is costing around Â£3million and will be on the opposite side of the Farmhouse to the small house being built for the Beckhamsâ€™.â€ The couple - who are a week away from quitting as senior royals - would be based on the other side of the farmhouse to the Beckhamsâ€™.  READ MORE: Royal row: Meghan and Harry should be 'on front line' like Kate      While David and Victoria often make fans jealous with their lavish Â£31million London mansion, they also own a barn conversion in the Cotswolds, where they holiday with their children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper during holidays or the weekends. As of next week, Harry and Meghan will keep their Windsor home, Frogmore Estate, but will start paying commercial rent, and repay Â£2.4 million in taxpayersâ€™ money they used when renovating the property.

130,Bill Gates open letter: The new Coronavirus epidemic reminds us that everyone is equal,Anonymous,"According to foreign media reports, on the afternoon of March 24 Bill Gates donated £ 85m last month to prevent the virus. Although this confusion is spreading, “there is something behind it,” he said.

In an open letter entitled “What can we learn from the spread of the new Coronavirus”, he wrote:

“It has its own meaning”

“I firmly believe that everything is deeper behind us, for better or worse.”

“As I think more deeply about this, I want to share my experiences with you: What does the new coronavirus mean for us?” 1. It reminds us that we are all equal regardless of culture, religion, profession, wealth or reputation. Compared to viruses, we are all equal. Maybe we should treat everyone the same.
If you don’t believe it, ask Tom Hanks.

2. It reminds us that we all have a deep connection. Individuals also have an impact on everyone.
It reminds us that the high walls of error that we have built do not matter because the virus is still running.

It also reminds us that although we are currently experiencing difficulties, more and more people will face life-long problems. 3. It reminds us that health is invaluable, but our lifestyle lags behind, eating unprocessed processed foods and drinking contaminated water.
If we continue to neglect health, the disease will eventually trap us.

4. It reminds us that life is short, mutual help is truly meaningful and helping the elderly and the patients we really should do.
Don’t waste your life buying toilet paper. 5. It reminds us of how materialistic our society is. When it comes to problems, we only know its needs (food, water, medicine, and what we really need), and tens of thousands of luxury goods can’t help us.
6. It reminds us of the importance of being with family members and reminding us of how much time we have wasted.
It forces us to return home, reunite with our families and strengthen family ties.

“what should we do”

7. It reminds us that work is not everything. Although we live for work, we do not live for work.
We really have to support each other, protect each other and take advantage of each other.

8. It always reminds us of self-realization.
It reminds us that whether you think you are great or really great, viruses can paralyze our world.

9. It reminds us that the power of free will is in our hands.
We can choose to cooperate, support, share, give and help each other. We can also choose to be interested in ourselves and only care about ourselves behind closed doors.

In fact, if you’re in trouble, you can tell the truth.

10. It reminds us that we can wait patiently and nervously.
We can be sensible and understand that there have been times like these and disasters will eventually pass. Or we may panic and preach to the end of the world, but this is ultimately harmful.

11. It reminds us that this is both the end and the beginning of a new point.
It can be a period of reflection and understanding, and we can learn from our mistakes. It can also be the starting point of a cycle, and we can only break this cycle if we can actually take it from it. 12. It reminds us that our planet is sick.
It reminds us that we should face the seriousness of deforestation, as well as when we value the speed at which toilet paper disappears. We are sick in our home because of inequality.

13. It reminds us that after dark the dawn will rise.
Life is cyclical, a phase in the cycle of human history that we go through. We don’t need to panic. Everything will be a thing of the past.

14. People think the New coronaVirus is a huge catastrophe, but I think it’s a “great fixer”.
The appearance of the new coronavirus epidemic reminds us of the important lessons we have apparently forgotten. It is still up to us to learn from the lessons.",1,
508,Africans facing coronavirus must not suffer the injustices they saw with Aids | Lydia Namubiru | Opinion | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lydia-namubiru,"The year I turned 11, my uncle Josiah Ssesanga was admitted to a hospital in Uganda with meningitis. It was 1994, and he was HIV positive. Between him and death stood a tattered post-civil war health system. Treatments for HIV and Aids existed in other parts of the world, but in Uganda they were mostly limited to those used in clinical trials. For my uncleâ€™s particular infection â€“ cryptococcal meningitis â€“ there was a drug called Fluconazole. But he didnâ€™t know it existed; regardless, he wouldnâ€™t have been able to afford it. and even among patients who took it, only 12% survived beyond six months. The day after his admission, â€œpeople from some American projectâ€ arrived with a mountain of paperwork, my aunt remembers. They were doing a clinical trial testing a more effective combination therapy. â€œThere were about three pages on possible side-effects of the drug. We were also warned that he would need to keep taking the drugs even if the project ended,â€ my aunt says. â€œBut for most of us, in that hour, our answer was yes. We were desperate. Anything to stop that pain.â€ Cryptococcal meningitis causes very severe headaches. These headaches drove uncle Ssesanga out of his mind and he often needed to be physically restrained. Once on the trial, my uncle received a combination of two drugs with rapid results: in under two weeks, he was discharged from inpatient care. In the subsequent months, he completed his university degree and became an inspector of schools. He would return to the hospital to meet researchers and had to endure painful lumbar punctures to track his recovery. However, the clinical trial provided only a few months of therapy beyond the researchersâ€™ initial period of investigation. After that, my uncle was told to start paying for his pills. A weekâ€™s supply alone cost more than he earned in a month. He quietly stopped the treatment. About a year later, a researcher came looking for him. She implored my relatives to get him back on treatment. But there was still not enough money. Two years later, he fell seriously ill and died in the harrowing way every Aids patient without access to antiretroviral therapy did. Today my family is proud that my uncle contributed to the development of combination therapy that restored hope and dignity to so many Aids patients globally. But we are still heartbroken that, for him and many other African patients, their contribution to these advances was unmarked and thankless. Now I fear that we will replay this painful script again as we face the coronavirus pandemic. Recently, two French doctors suggested that coronavirus vaccine trials should be done in Africa: the continent with the lowest numbers of confirmed cases so far. Speaking on French TV, one said: â€œIf I can be provocative, shouldnâ€™t we be doing this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation?â€ Given the long history of medical racism and painful experiences like that of my familyâ€™s, some Africans were understandably annoyed, calling these comments racist and akin to treating people as â€œhuman guinea pigsâ€. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, described the doctorsâ€™ comments as a hangover from a â€œcolonial mentalityâ€, and said that â€œAfrica canâ€™t and wonâ€™t be a testing ground for any vaccineâ€. And yet â€“ as happened with the Aids pandemic â€“ Africa will certainly be a testbed for some coronavirus therapies, vaccines or contagion controls. It already is. The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) has, for instance, put out an early â‚¬4.75m call for research proposals on Covid-19 responses in Africa. And this is actually a good thing. Excluding the continent from ongoing pandemic research is not the answer. Clinical trials can be ethically done â€“ and many African countries and institutions now have ethics review boards to oversee this research. The injustice is in how geopolitical power imbalances, through patent law, ration access to the drugs that come out of successful trials. In 1996, the United States began approving the powerful combination therapies to treat HIV and Aids that came out of studies like the one my uncle was part of. It was a watershed moment for US activists (many of them marginalised gay men). But it should not have been only theirs. Patients across the developing world had also given their own blood, spinal fluid and sinew, to test and establish these therapies. For years, with the cover of western patent laws, drug companies priced medicines out of their reach. By 2000, when Indiaâ€™s Cipla Pharmaceuticals defied these patents to produce generic Aids drugs that countries in the global south could afford to purchase for their citizens, my uncle was long dead. The WHOâ€™s declaration that Africa wonâ€™t be a testing ground for coronavirus vaccines ultimately overlooks a much bigger problem. What we really need is assurance that Africa will get any vaccine or treatment at the same time as any other region; and on terms which mean we can actually afford it. MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res has stated that governments must â€œprepare to suspend and override patentsâ€. Warning that companies might try to â€œprofiteerâ€ from Covid-19, MÃ¡rcio da Fonseca, an MSF infectious disease adviser, has urged governments to â€œset the wheels in motion to override [patent] monopolies, so they can ensure the supply of affordable drugs and save more livesâ€. Rather than simply banning clinical trials in Africa, and excluding the continent from research, this is the solution that would have saved my uncleâ€™s life. â€¢ Lydia Namubiru, a Ugandan feminist and journalist, is the Africa editor for 50.50, a section of openDemocracy â€¢ This piece was co-published by openDemocracy, and the fee was donated to Children of the Sun Foundation (CoSF), serving LGBTI Ugandans living with HIV/Aids.

524,Temenos helps US banks and credit unions to respond rapidlyÂ to surging demand for emergency loans for small businesses during Covid-19 | The Fintech Times,Mark Walker,"Temenos (SIX: TEMN), the banking software company, announced today that its Temenos Infinity digital omnichannel product is enabling US banks and credit unions to accelerate loan applications to small businesses under the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP). Implemented under the US Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the PPP seeks to inject an immediate $349 billion in rescue loans for small businesses impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Banks had to respond to the new demands from the government in a timeline that was less than a week. As reported in the press, banks ranging in scale from large Tier 1s to regional banks and credit unions are seeing unprecedented demand for loans from businesses and are struggling to process the application volumes. Temenos is already enabling banks to deploy a digital experience for customers applying for PPP. Temenos was able to deliver a specific PPP digital loan application solution with integrated processing workflows in 4 days. This enables small businesses to apply for funding digitally without human assistance from the bank and it includes built-in quality controls to ensure that mandatory fields get filled in so it does not need to be reworked and delay the loan processing. The digital portal also allows to streamline the application for funds for the banks to route to the SBA E-Tran system for approvals. With Journey Manager, part of Temenos Infinity, Temenos can deliver flexible and agile digital workflows to accelerate customer journeys from loan applications, to account opening and KYC due diligence. Furthermore, Temenos is enhancing its Temenos Infinity product with additional functionality for SMEs by automating decisioning options through its Explainable AI (XAI) platform, while enabling banks to explain in plain language to their customers and regulators how AI-based decisions are taken. Kelly Dakin, Chief Digital and Customer Experience Officer, Atlantic Union Bank, said: â€œOur top priority in these unprecedented times is supporting our small business and commercial clients. By working with Temenosâ€™ dedicated and customer-focused team, we were able to build a brand new digital loan portal specifically for the PPP in less than a week. But, most importantly, through this work we continue to support our business clients and their employees, so they can receive funding and support in their time of need.â€ Alexa Guenoun, President, Americas and Global Head of Partners, Temenos, said: â€œWe are proud to support financial institutions to in-turn assist small businesses apply for rescue loans and speed up economic relief during this time of disruption. Our teams â€“ Temenos and the banks â€“ are working tirelessly to deliver projects in days that would normally take months. We are delighted we could help Atlantic Union Bank process loan applications and support small businesses and their employees. Temenosâ€™ cloud advanced technology gives banks the flexibility and agility required to serve digitally the rapidly changing customer needs and respond immediately to the new government requirements.â€ Christine Barry, Research Director, Wholesale Banking, Aite Group said: â€œBanks are struggling to come to grips with the implications of Covid-19 not only because they have to ensure seamless continuity of their business and systems operation but because they also have to respond to exceptional demands from governments such as the PPP within impossible timeframes. Temenos Infinity with dynamic digital banking user experience and flexible technology can help banks respond to the immediate customer and regulatory demands as well as anticipate future changes such as further stimulus packages or changes in the application processes.â€ Temenos Infinity is the leading omnichannel digital banking product covering customer engagement from acquisition, to account servicing, through to long-term retention.

439,Coronavirus: UK lockdown needs to end in four weeks to recover economy | City & Business | Finance | Express.co.uk,Dylan Donnelly," The UK is currently seeing major losses to itâ€™s GDP, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warning that the economy could shrink by 35 percent this spring. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a World Health Organisation (WHO) expert, has shared his hopes that the pandemic was â€œprobably past itâ€™s peak.â€ He hoped that lockdown can be gently lifted as the UK started to see the effects of social distancing, with the lowest daily death rate for a fortnight at 596. He said to Sophy Ridge on Sky News: â€œThe lockdown is damaging business and ultimately that is damaging all of our lives so the lockdowns canâ€™t go on forever.â€ â€œThe damage itâ€™s doing to all of our health, our wellbeing, our mental health, disproportionately affects the most vulnerable and the least able to cope with it in society, thatâ€™s a really big issue of inequality.â€ Please sign up to pledge your support now to our brave NHS Heroes   Sir Farrar said that if the circulation of the virus in the community, hospitals and care homes was reduced â€œdramatically,â€ then he hoped lockdown could start to be eased â€œin three, four weeksâ€™ time because it is clear that (it) canâ€™t go on for much longer.â€ He did warn that future waves of COVID-19 may occur if the measures were lifted too quickly. Relaxing the disease management measures too early could see it â€œrebound very quickly within a few weeks or a couple of months.â€ Currently the government has no clear timetable for exiting lockdown measures, which have been extended to May 7 where a second review will take place.

When asked when the UKâ€™s testing and contact analysis capabilities would be good enough to make the call to end lockdown, Mr Gove wanâ€™t able to answer.

338,"UPDATE 3-""It's ridiculous"": Trump travel ban sows panic in European airports",,"* Travel ban affects nationals of 26 European nations * U.S. travellers excluded but many trying to go home early * Some criticise Trump for lack of warning and coordination (Adds fresh quote, more details) MADRID/PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - Weary and confused travellers, many wearing face masks, rushed to board flights from European airports to the United States on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping travel restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus. His 30-day travel order applies to citizens of 26 European countries but excludes Britain and Ireland as well as American citizens. It takes effect from midnight on Friday. ""It caused a mass panic,"" said 20-year-old Anna Grace, a U.S. student on her first trip to Europe who changed her booking to fly home from Madrid's Barajas airport instead of going on to France. Her friends were less successful in rebooking flights. Though American citizens are exempt from the travel ban, Grace and many others said they preferred to return home in case the restrictions are expanded or for fear of contracting coronavirus while in Europe. ""We are nervous that we won't be able to get back into the country,"" said Atlantia resident Jay Harrison, 29, hoping to board a flight in Brussels. ""If it's going to be another 30 days and we're stranded, it's going to be very difficult, very expensive and just tough to get back in and tough to live with."" Paola Mesa, 29, a Spanish woman flying from Barcelona to San Francisco, said she backed Trump's ban on travel from Europe. ""Its what Spain should have done before,"" she said. The death toll from coronavirus in Spain nearly doubled to 84 on Thursday and the number of cases rose to nearly 3,000. Trump says he had to act as the European Union had failed to take adequate measures to stop the coronavirus. The EU dismissed his comments and criticised the lack of consultation from the U.S. side. ""A BIG MESS"" Many travellers, however, were critical of Trump's decision. ""It's ridiculous. Why do we impose a ban now when the virus is already in the United States?"" said Leo Mota, 24, who had just arrived at Paris's main international airport, Roissy Charles de Gaulle, from Los Angeles. Miguel Paracuellos, a Spaniard who works in the United States, said Trump was trying to compensate for his failure to expand testing and screening programmes at home. ""He is blaming an external enemy, in this case Europe,"" he said. Jon Lindfors, an American traveller in Paris, was equally scathing about Trump, who will seek re-election in November. ""Trump said it's not a health crisis but it is, that it's not an economic crisis but it is. We don't believe what Trump says anymore,"" Lindfors said. A Delta crew member, who asked not to be named, said Trumps travel ban had caught the airline off-guard. ""It's going to be a big mess... We were not expecting something like that. We don't have all the details to know what it means for us and for the company,"" the crew member said. At Rome's Fiumicino airport, largely empty due to draconian measures taken by Italy to combat coronavirus, one Italian traveller just back from New York said the United States would soon face the disruption Europe is now experiencing. ""(In New York)... there were only a few flights cancelled or delayed... They don't understand the situation yet,"" said Giuseppe Riccio, who wore a face mask. ""There are no controls in place, shops are full of people."" Gregory and Ada Goldberg, an American couple from San Francisco, were trying to bring forward their flight home from Barcelona but were not getting much help at the airport. ""This was meant to be two weeks of pleasant vacation but it has become a nightmare,"" said 69-year-old Ada.

161,How karma works: is it possible that COVID-19 is a successful project of the USA?,Anonymous,"Western European countries such as Italy, Spain and Germany have become main epicenters of the spread of the coronavirus infection right after China, and on March 24, WHO announced that the United States became the new focus of the spread of COVID-19 (currently there are 142 735 people infected in the United States).

Against the backdrop of the rapid spread of coronavirus in the United States and the accompanying decline in the economic activity, confirmed by the American President, the Trump Administration is confidently acting within the framework of anti-Chinese policy: quoting diplomatic sources, NBC News says that the Administration demands that the fact of “the Wuhan origin” of COVID-19 is included in the UN resolution. In Beijing, it is not denied that the virus could have been brought into China by the American troops. If some time ago such assumptions were little taken into account and for the most part rejected, being similar to conspiracy theories, today most politicians around the world have already begun talking about their legitimacy.

The US is known for its alarming activity in sponsoring biological weapon laboratories involved in the study of pathogenic biological agents, “obtaining biological material for future experiments”, as well as developing and introducing new technologies into the military sphere. Of particular interest is the geographical location of such laboratories: these are the countries of western and central Asia: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Georgia. We also note the agreement signed in 2005 between the Health Department of Ukraine and the US Department of Defense, according to which “in order to assist Ukraine in preventing the spread of technologies, pathogens and knowledge located in the Research Institute of Epidemiology and Hygiene in Lviv, as well as other facilities in Ukraine, defined by the Health Department of Ukraine, which can be used in the development of biological weapons, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the US Department of Defense provides grant aid in the amount of cash allocated to achieve this goal to the Health Department of Ukraine”.

The next important object is the Lugar Laboratory, also known as the Georgian Research Center in Tbilisi, which is functioning at the disposal of the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health of Georgia and is the investment project of the USA aimed at creating a strategic military facility. The laboratory is studying especially dangerous infectious diseases, but it hides the true motives of its research, which may indicate the possibility of developing biological weapons. Statements about the danger associated with the activities of this center were repeatedly voiced by Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Nikolai Patrushev, as well as numerous representatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The available data suggest that the main vectors of the direction of the bacteriological threat emanating from the United States are Russia and mainland China.

Taking into account the given facts, let us try to hypothesize that the new coronavirus pneumonia is a provocation of the USA, an American military development, introduced through biological weapon laboratories located in West Asia in order to destroy the main rival of the USA – China. The goal of introducing such a means of struggle could initially be not only elimination of the constant threat of the increasing economic influence of the “Celestial Empire”, but also obtaining the greatest benefits from the trade agreement that was supposed to be concluded with China: after all, it was much easier to agree with an economy weakened by coronavirus that had struck its main driving force, on  conditions, not entirely beneficial for it. In this case, it was already a question of an ethnic war conducted with the use of new bacteriological weapons. Trump’s traditional attacks on China add fuel to the fire, an attempt to accuse it of launching a global pandemic is Trump’s typical game in the style of “the best defense is an attack”.

However, now that the political intrigue is gaining new momentum and the US itself is falling into the hole it made for its rival, what does the world superpower have to do next?

On March 29, a source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said that Russia was concerned about the US military and biological activities in nearby countries, being implemented in the laboratory workouts fiAnonymousced by the Pentagon, and insists on clarifying the purpose of these laboratories.

“As for the “American trace” in the emergence of COVID-19, we don’t have such information for today”, – a source in the Foreign Ministry said. “However, for a long time we have been watching with concern the US military and biological activities carried out in close proximity to our borders. In our neighboring countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and the latter border with China, there are biological laboratories created with the money of Washington and with the participation of business travelling specialists from there”, – he added.

The Italian political expert Tiberio Graziani, President of the Vision & Global Trends International Institute for Global Analysis, in an interview with News Front correspondents, commented on the situation as follows:

“Currently, with reference to the lab creation of the coronavirus, as a bacterioligic weapon, there are no certain elements to affirm it. The fact that these theories or assumptions run on various media and social networks is a demonstration of the frustration of those who write or disseminate them. However, it should be emphasized that so-called conspiracy hypotheses of this kind actually create a smoke screen that prevents a serious, peaceful and articulated debate on global epidemics.

“In my opinion, the question of such health crises cannot be reduced to an ideological confrontation. However, this must not be an alibi for not investigating military laboratories that develop bacterioligic weapons”, – Mr. Grziani said.

The conclusion suggests itself: of course, we should not prematurely put conspiracy theological ideas into the mass consciousness of the civilian population. Nevertheless, the question of the open, legal functioning of worrying laboratories is one of the leading issues on the political agenda of government agencies of all countries of the world community. Joint efforts should be made to study the activities of centers for the research of biological material, ideologically and fiAnonymouscially supported by the United States of America. One of the priority tasks is to give Lugar’s Tbilisi laboratory an international status, which will allow independent experts from Russia, European and Western countries to fully participate in its activities and be aware of all the nuances of the experiments. This will increase the chances of preserving the right to a safe existence of citizens in the nearby territories.",1,
471,"South Korea advises facilities suspension, experts warn of 'long battle' against coronavirus - Reuters",Joyce Lee,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Saturday advised its public to close facilities and forgo socialising for 15 days, keeping to its policy of voluntary social distancing but warning of consequences if the rules are not followed to slow the coronavirus outbreak. The country reported 147 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, jumping from the previous dayâ€™s 87, and experts noted the need to prepare for a â€œlong battleâ€ as concerns of imported cases and new outbreaks around small clusters persisted. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said in a televised address the government strongly recommended religious, indoor sports and entertainment facilities such as nightclubs suspend operations, and people avoid socialising and travel for the next 15 days. If facilities do not conform to rules such as mandatory mask wearing for all users, at least 1 meter (3.3 ft) distance between everyone and listing the names and phone numbers of all entrants while operating, the government will order gatherings to disperse. â€œIn the event of failure to comply with the administrative order, we will actively take all possible measures stipulated by law, including the facilitiesâ€™ shutdown and indemnity claims,â€ Chung said. Saturdayâ€™s cases bring the countryâ€™s total to 8,799. The number of deaths associated with the virus rose to 104. The tally marked the 10th day in a row the country has posted new infections in the mid-100s or below, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). South Korea has seen a downward trend in new cases from the peak of 909 cases reported on Feb. 29. Out of 147 new cases, 109 were from South Koreaâ€™s fourth-largest city, Daegu, and adjoining North Gyeongsang Province, where 86% of all South Korean cases have been. More than 165 cases in the region were spread in and from hospitals for the elderly, KCDC data showed. But other regions also saw increases, including 15 new cases in Seoul and six detected in people entering the country from abroad. â€œYou may feel that the current situation has improved a lot compared to the past, but... we continue to see group infection, inflows from foreign countries, mass outbreaks at workplaces,â€ Yoon Tae-ho, director general for public health policy, said at a briefing. Yoon cited experts as saying that more arrangements in structural social distancing and medical systems are needed to â€œprepare for a long battleâ€ as coronavirus spreads globally, but said South Korea has not considered the extreme forms of travel restrictions that other countries have taken. President Moon Jae-in and government officials from vice minister and up will return 30% of their paychecks for four months to support those hit by coronavirus, the Prime Ministerâ€™s office said. Prime Minister Chung said earlier on Saturday that up to 3.8 trillion won ($3.03 billion) in disaster management funds may be used for small businesses and disadvantaged people specifically for coronavirus-related difficulties.

347,Rick and Morty season 4 theories: Key character revealed as Parasite? | TV & Radio | Showbiz & TV | Express.co.uk,Lucas Hill-Paul,"  Fans of the series are used to sitting around waiting for new episodes of Rick and Morty. During the extended wait for new episodes, devoted viewers of the Adult Swim cartoon have been theorising potential revelations in the upcoming season.   Productions of television series worldwide have been stalled in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Season four of Rick and Morty is currently underway, but hasnâ€™t released a new episode since the fifth aired in mid-December last year. Now the covid-19 pandemic has begun to influence production of major television series, fans could be expecting an announcement of an even further delay for the cartoon. Throughout the hiatus, fans have not only been looking for clues pointing to when the show will return, but also speculating on various theories for upcoming revelations. READ MORE: Rick and Morty season 4, episode 6 release date: When does it return?     One episode in the first season, entitled Total Rickall, introduced a sinister new concept to the show. After Rick and Mortyâ€™s (both played by Justin Roiland) family house is invaded by shapeshifting, alien parasites, fans have been even more paranoid some characters may not be as they appear. The house becomes invaded by kooky characters, who alter the familyâ€™s memory to infiltrate their lives. Among them is the crassly named Mr. Poopy Butthole, who is eventually revealed not to be a parasite after all in a hilarious twist at the end of the episode.     However, some fans of the series are still suspicious of the new character, who has since made reappearances. Reddit user ruturaj_chothe said: â€œIn my opinion Mr. Poopy Butthole is the leader of these parasites or something like that that's why he was not that easy to kill.â€ Throughout the episode parasites are killed by the Smiths when they discover the alien species can only produce fond memories. My Poopy Butthole is shot in the arm by Beth (Sarah Chalke), but instead of the purple substance the parasites exude he bleeds humanlike red blood.

Another fan took to Reddit to point out another character who did not revert back to their parasite form when they were shot. Redditor SwaysInYourMind said: â€œIn the picture, we can see a character that has been shot and yet this character did not go back to a parasitic form.â€ Either this character is faking their death, or both he and Mr Poopy Butthole are parasites whose biology doesnâ€™t revert back to their true form upon injury.   One fan contributed a different theory, adding: â€œBest theory is this is not Dimension C-137 and Mr. Poopy Butthole is a family friend but in a different dimension.â€ Rick and Mortyâ€™s fictional world consists of infinite alternate dimensions, and itâ€™s entirely possible Mr Poopy Butthole could have hopped over from another universe. The character has popped up throughout the series, mainly as a benevolent presence, but these theories indicate fans could see him reveal sinister ulterior motives.

12,Speaker Anonymouscy Pelosi Caught Trying to Include Abortion Funding in Bill to Combat Coronavirus,STEVEN ERTELT,"Americans to fund killing babies in abortion that she has been caught trying to add taxpayer fiAnonymouscing of abortions to the bill to combat the Coronavirus and provide economic stimulus to the nation as it deals with the COVD-19 outbreak. Anonymouscy Pelosi has a long history of promoting abortion and her first act after becoming Speaker in 2019 was pushing legislation to use tax money for abortions. So it’s no surprise she is trying to exploit the Coronavirus pandemic to push abortion funding again. As The Daily Caller reports: House Speaker Anonymouscy Pelosi sought to include a potential way to guarantee federal funding for abortion into the coronavirus economic stimulus plan, according to multiple senior White House officials. Speaking to the Daily Caller, those officials alleged that while negotiating the stimulus with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi tried to lobby for “several” provisions that stalled bipartisan commitment to the effort. One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment. LifeNews depends on the support of readers like you to combat the pro-abortion media. Please donate now. “A New mandatory funding stream that does not have Hyde protections would be unprecedented,” one White House official explained. “Under the guise of protecting people, Speaker Pelosi is working to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent covering abortion—which is not only backwards, but goes against historical norms.”
A second White House official referred to the provision as a “slush fund” and yet another questioned “what the Hyde Amendment and abortion have to do with protecting Americans from coronavirus?” Americans should insist to their members of Congress that we need a clean bill that provides aggressive action to help patients and spur the economy. Killing babies with our tax dollars is not the answer to the coronavirus and the situation should not be exploited for political gain.",1,

315,Man Utd news: Seven players miss training session ahead of Europa League clash | Football | Sport | Express.co.uk,Dan Alexander," Manchester United completed their final training session ahead of Thursday's Europa League clash with LASK this morning and several first-team players were notable in their absence. Most concerning for United fans will be Anthony Martial who arrived at Carrington but did not take part in the session. According to the Manchester Evening News the Frenchman, who has scored 11 Premier League goals and shouldered the goal scoring responsibility with Marcus Rashford injured, arrived at the training ground in club kit but did not take part in the session. Jesse Lingard and Diego Dalot were also absent with the Portuguese defender leaving Carrington before the session got underway. Lingard was pictured at the training ground but was not in club kit, suggesting he may not be traveling to Austria with the rest of the squad. Long-term absentees Rashford, Paul Pogba and Lee Grant remain unavailable for selection, while academy prospect James Garner also missed the session.  Ole Gunnnar Solskjaer is due to address the media later this afternoon and will provide an update on the fitness of his squad. The United squad are set to fly out to Austria this afternoon ahead of the last-16 tie which will be played behind closed doors following the spread of coronavirus. Around 900 United fans had tickets for the tie but cannot attend and will be refunded instead. United released a statement announcing that as it stands fans will still be able to attend home matches.  The statement read: ""Manchester United is closely monitoring the evolving situation with coronavirus (COVID-19) on a day-by-day basis, and following any guidance issued by our governing bodies and the UK government. ""Based on that guidance, all home matches are currently scheduled to go ahead as planned and any change in the situation would be communicated to fans as soon as possible. ""Old Trafford currently remains open to fans for matches, as well as for visitors to our Museum, Megastore and the Red Cafe. Our Stadium Tours are going ahead as normal except for the changing rooms, which are closed to visitors until further notice as a precautionary measure."" LASK president Siegmund Gruber expressed his disappointment at the decision to play the game without fans. He said: ""Itâ€™s the biggest match but not the most important match of the clubâ€™s history. It would be a reward for the club, the city, the people. Itâ€™s a pity it canâ€™t take place like that. ""We are not so happy about how the health office in the government has dealt with this.

203,"Coronavirus testing is really about harvesting your DNA for a government database
",Ethan Huff,"Testing, testing, and more testing: This is all that the government can talk about these days in response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic – that and a future vaccine, of course. But what if we told you that the true intent behind mass testing is to steal people’s DNA and store it away in government databases?

It might sound like some kind of crazy sci-fi flick, but hear us out. Back in late April when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was asked about what happens after a person is tested for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and whether the results “automatically go into some kind of database,” this was Cuomo’s chilling response:

“Yes, your result will be logged into both a state and county database through an electronic lab reporting system. The database includes your name.”

When further pressed about what a positive test result entails from the government’s standpoint, Cuomo explained that all newly infected are being ordered by their county health departments to quarantine for 14 days from the time of their most recent symptoms. They are also being asked to procure the names of anyone they may have come into contact with so that they, too, can be told to quarantine.

This directly ties into the contact tracing push from people like Bill and Hillary Clinton, who want an “army of contact tracers” to sweep the nation and hunt down anyone who might have been infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Be sure to listen to the following episode of The Health Ranger Report in which Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks to Dr. Judy Mikovits about these and other authoritarian measures being thrown at the people in response to this “plandemic:” In addition to the typical swabbing protocol, another form of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) testing apparently involves taking blood samples by pricking people’s fingers, which the federal government is now implementing at pharmacies across America.

This combination of collecting both saliva and blood would seem to suggest that dark forces are perhaps trying to profile people’s genomes for some other purpose besides keeping them “safe” from a virus.

Keep in mind that there may never even be a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), at least according to Dr. David Nabarro from the WHO, a professor of global health at Imperial College London.

As it turns out, it is quite difficult to produce an effective vaccine for a virus, let alone one that continues to mutate and basically become new viruses. If a vaccine is, in fact, released, chances are it will not be effective nor will it be safe.

“There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against,” Nabarro is quoted as saying. “We can’t make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.”

Without a vaccine, experts are automatically predicting that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will never go away and instead become an annual event. And they are saying this while completely ignoring nutrition, supplementation, and other lifestyle changes that could easily protect the masses at a minimal cost.

“It’s absolutely essential that all societies everywhere get themselves into a position where they are able to defend against the coronavirus as a constant threat, and to be able to go about social life and economic activity with the virus in our midst,” Nabarro says.",1,
358,What I'm learning from being trapped in quarantine with my ex-fiance | US news | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/holly-brockwell,"Just about any aspect of the current global situation sounds like a dystopian movie. But if youâ€™d told me that Iâ€™d one day find myself hiding from a deadly virus in a small apartment with my ex-fiance, Iâ€™d probably have run onto the streets screaming. Which is not an option available to me right now. Instead, Iâ€™m stuck in lockdown with the person I once thought Iâ€™d marry but who I belatedly realized â€“ to borrow a metaphor â€“ would never renounce dogs and become the cat person I always dreamed of. Is it possible to make it through such a bizarre scenario unscathed? Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m learning. We had a great origin story. I met him at a night-time videogame event outside a castle. I muttered something to myself, and the darkness laughed in reply. After some conversation with the shadowy figure, we went back inside and I was delighted to find he was handsome and interesting. We became friends, and several years later when his girlfriend was out of the picture, a couple. We moved in together after just six weeks together, into a cupboard-sized apartment. We bonded over a mutual love of birds and quickly started adopting rescues: at one point, we had 23 and couldnâ€™t hear ourselves above the chirping. He reluctantly allowed me to fulfill my dreams and get a cat, although he was less pleased about the second and downright angry about the third. Disagreements over the cats were the first crack. I longed to be married, which led to a very unwise engagement after three years together. The final year was peppered with volcanic arguments â€“ he was working all hours, I wasnâ€™t helping enough at home, the third cat kept throwing up everywhere. As luck would have it, we broke things off just after weâ€™d signed a year-long apartment contract. I made plans to move out and find a replacement tenant, and then coronavirus hit. We hadnâ€™t seen a whole lot of one another before lockdown kicked in because my ex was doing the healthy thing and getting on with his life. He was out almost every night and weekend, so weâ€™d have short, snatched conversations in the kitchen about whether we needed any more dish soap, and not much else. Sheltering in place meant we were in the same room a lot more. Inevitably, we talked. I learned the hard way that even a casual, funny story about how badly online dating was going for me was not welcome. He hit the roof and made it very clear that there would be no discussion of dating, new partners, or that guy I went out with for a few weeks after him. And of course, our breakup raised its unwelcome head. The resulting arguments were some of our worst. We rehashed the problems that caused the split, the unsolved grievances about how each of us handled it (me: terrible rebound boyfriend, him: stonewalling), and whether we still loved each other (yes, surprisingly). No one gained anything from it but resentment. A few weeks of cabin fever later, I was seeing him with new eyes. He wasno longer at work all the time, weâ€™d had some fun conversations and movie nights, and our former love nest was the only safe place left. It was intoxicating, like being the last two people on earth. We slipped back into our former way of communicating. With the little in-jokes and made-up words, it started to feel so much like old times that I even accidentally called him â€œbabyâ€. Add to this the fact that we were being kind to one another â€“ Iâ€™d make him hot drinks, heâ€™d bring me back little treats when he ventured outside, and offered warm hugs and reassurance when it all got too scary and I broke down crying â€“ and itâ€™s easy to see how our next terrible argument started. Sitting on the couch gazing at the man Iâ€™d loved for so long, I wrote him a long text message about trying again. It seemed too huge to say out loud. It didnâ€™t go down well. In fact, the response was a bit like splitting up all over again, only with no exit door. He told me unequivocally that it was over for good, and that our breakup had done exactly that: broken us. The kindness and gestures were partly because he still cares about me, and partly because heâ€™s a nice person in a strange situation. Iâ€™ve had to learn to stop reading into them. One of the best things about living with a partner is getting to be unashamedly yourself. Iâ€™ve realized that this applies even with an ex. Those lines have already been crossed, we donâ€™t have to uncross them just because weâ€™re in a pandemic. We had separate bedrooms when we were together because he kicks like a mule in his sleep, so there was no awkward bed situation to navigate. But he still comes to shower in my en-suite bathroom, even when my underwear is all over the floor. And Iâ€™m still my most authentic self with him â€“ the worst jokes, the stained pyjamas, the craziest quarantine hair. And when we both fell ill at the same time (not with Covid-19, thankfully), we were still able to laugh about the symptoms. Thankfully, heâ€™s someone I can count on to bring me another toilet roll in my time of need. At this point, no one knows how long lockdown will last. Everything feels surreal, but nothing more so for me than sharing takeout with my former fiance, laughing at old jokes, knowing heâ€™d rather be anywhere but here. This extra time with him has reminded me why I fell in love with him, even as I know there are painful parts to come, like splitting up our shared belongings. The birds are going with him. But the cats? Theyâ€™re mine.",0,
253,Report: Wuhan Funeral Homes Burned Coronavirus Victims Alive,FRANCES MARTEL,"Locals in Wuhan, where the Chinese coronavirus pandemic originated, have heard screams coming from funeral home furnaces, and some treated in hospitals say they saw workers put living coronavirus patients in body bags, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Monday. RFA noted that it could not independently verify that the Chinese Communist Party was burning coronavirus patients alive, nor has the Communist Party confirmed or denied the rumors. Yet the rumors persist that, to make room for new patients in Wuhan’s overcrowded hospitals, medical staff chose older patients less likely to survive the infection and shipped them to incinerators while they were still alive and conscious. RFA quoted a source “close to the funeral industry” identified only as Ma who said that he had heard reports of “people restrained and forced into body bags when they were still moving.” “Some people are saying that … there are video clips of screams coming from funeral homes, from inside the furnaces … which tells us that some people were taken to the funeral homes while they were still alive,” Ma added. Ma also noted the existence of video testimony from an anonymous older woman who had been treated at a Wuhan hospital, presumably for Chinese coronavirus. “One old lady was saying that they put one guy into … a body bag when he wasn’t even dead yet, and took him off to the crematorium because there was no way of saving him,” Ma told RFA. Video of an older woman speaking anonymously to a camera began circulating on social media in February in which she said she witnessed a patient next to her at a Wuhan hospital stuffed into a body bag while still alive. “He’s not dead, his feet and hands are still moving,” the woman says, “[They] wrapped him in a plastic body bag and zipped it up.” According to New Tang Dynasty, a broadcaster affiliated with the persecuted Chinese Falun Gong movement, the woman spoke with a Wuhan accent, suggesting she was a native of the central Chinese city. The Taiwanese outlet Taiwan News traced the origin of the video to a Chinese student group called “Youth Production,” who reportedly uploaded the video on February 24. Taiwan News noted that the woman claimed to have suffered from coronavirus symptoms but, as she was in her 60s, she did not suffer severe symptoms, unlike the man taken away, who she estimated was in his 70s. “She said that the man was weak but was still breathing when medical workers ‘bound his head’ and then his hands and feet, which were ‘still moving,’” Taiwan News reported, noting that she also lamented that the hospital where she received care had no other treatments available for coronavirus patients besides oxygen. In the West, doctors have begun experimenting with several drug mixtures, one of which — a combination of antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat lupus and malaria — has generated optimism in American hospitals.",1,
401,Coronavirus latest: 18 April at a glance | World news | The Guardian,Christine Kearney,"Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: More than 2.2 million people have been infected worldwide with Covid-19 and at least 154,219 people have died since the outbreak began, according to Johns Hopkins University. The figures, which are based on official data and media reports, are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes. Donald Trump said that protestors who flouted social distancing measures â€œseem to be very responsible peopleâ€. Demonstrations against stay-at-home orders, which have drawn elements of the far right, have been held in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia. Some protesters have carried guns, waved Trump and Confederate flags and sought to frame the debate as a defence of constitutional freedoms. President Trump also cast doubt on Chinaâ€™s death toll, which was revised up on Friday, and said that â€œa lot of strange things are happeningâ€ regarding the origins of the coronavirus. While the source of the virus is unknown, the broad scientific consensus is that it originated in bats. Trumpâ€™s coronavirus task force members have pushed back against criticism that limited testing ability is preventing the country from tackling the virus. Hospitals in Japan are increasingly turning away sick people as the country struggles with surging coronavirus infections and its emergency medical system collapses according to reports. Japanâ€™s total infections stand at more than 9,800, with 207 deaths, according to a tally by public broadcaster NHK. Chinaâ€™s politburo has said that the government must pursue a comprehensive reopening of Chinaâ€™s economy while taking steps to restrict the spread of coronavirus, it was reported by Chinaâ€™s state-run Global Times. The meeting on Friday also said government spending should be increased and the central bank should cut market loan rates to support business. China reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, of which 17 were linked to foreign travel. No new fatalities were recorded. All airline passengers in Canada will be required to wear a non-medical masks or face coverings during travel to curb the spread of coronavirus. The regulator said travellers must cover their mouth and nose during the boarding process and flights. The rule goes into effect on Monday. The Guatemalan president Alejandro Giammattei has said that migrants who were deported from the US on Monday were infected with Covid-19. Giammattei said 12 randomly selected migrants who took the flight from the US tested positive for coronavirus when examined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US health protection agency. Flights deporting Guatemalan migrants from the United States have been once again temporarily suspended after reports of the infections.",0,
312,Stephen King is using 'The Stand' to warn people about the coronavirus spread,Sam Haysom,"If it feels like we're living in a disaster movie at the moment, that's probably because there's been so much famous fiction chronicling deadly pandemics in the past. One of the many novels about the rapid spread of a virus is The Stand by Stephen King â€” a story which details the collapse of the U.S. after a weaponised influenza strain gets accidentally released. Earlier this month, back before social distancing measures were introduced across America, and prior to COVID-19 being officially called a pandemic by the World Heath Organisation (WHO), King tried to put a stop to the comparisons. No, coronavirus is NOT like THE STAND. Itâ€™s not anywhere near as serious. Itâ€™s eminently survivable. Keep calm and take all reasonable precautions. â€” Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 8, 2020 It's obvious why he tweeted that â€” with its ""99.4 percent communicability"", the superflu in King's novel wipes out the majority of the human race. The mortality rate doesn't compare to that of COVID-19, which has been put between 1 and 3.4 percent. But still, there are undeniable similarities. SEE ALSO: The deadliest fictional pandemics and what they tell us about coronavirus panic On Sunday, less than two weeks after his initial tweet, King is now appearing to embrace the comparisons, using a chapter from The Stand as a warning. Chapter 8 of THE STAND. This is how it works. Heed. (But remember COID-19 is not as lethal as the superflu.)https://t.co/yqvwbjoVMs â€” Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 22, 2020 Chapter 8, in a nutshell, chronicles just how quickly the fictional, highly contagious disease spreads. Honestly, it hits pretty close to home. Here's a snapshot: ""Joe-Bob felt fine. Dying was the last thing on his mind. Nevertheless, he was already a sick man. He had gotten more than gas at Bill Hanscombe's Texaco. And he gave Harry Trent more than a speeding summons. Harry, a gregarious man who liked his job, passed the sickness to more than 40 people during that day and the next. How many those 40 passed it to is impossible to say â€“ you might as well ask how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. If you were to make a conservative estimate of five a piece, you'd have 200. Using the same conservative formula, one could say those 200 went on to infect a thousand, the thousand five-thousand, the five-thousand twenty-five-thousand. Under the California desert and subsidised by the tax payers' money, someone had finally invented a chain letter that really worked."" King followed the chapter up with a reminder about the importance of social distancing, the best weapon we've got to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Keep your distance. â€” Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 22, 2020 COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, has now infected over 294,000 people worldwide.

89,"Coronavirus: No child known to have passed COVID-19 to adults, global study finds",Alix Culbertson,"No child is known to have passed COVID-19 on to an adult, a review of evidence from around the world has found.

The review into paediatric coronavirus studies found it is likely children ""do not play a significant role"" in transmitting the coronavirus and are significantly less likely to become infected than adults. It also found there has not been a single case of a child under 10 transmitting COVID-19, even through contact tracing carried out by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Collated by paediatric blog Don't Forget The Bubbles, in partnership with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), researchers looked at 78 studies from around the world, with most from China where the disease originated. The findings come as the Swiss government said grandparents are now allowed to hug their grandchildren because they concluded that ""young children don't transmit the virus"". Led by Alasdair Munro, a clinical research fellow in paediatric infectious diseases, the new study concluded: ""COVID-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or subclinical infection. ""There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare. The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role."" They used an example of a nine-year-old boy in the French Alps who tested positive, with symptoms. Despite attending three schools during this time, exposing 112 different people, the child did not transmit COVID-19 to anybody else. Professor Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, told the Daily Telegraph: ""From around the world, we are not seeing evidence that children are involved in spreading or transmitting the virus, but we do not have enough evidence."" He added that it was too soon to say children could hug their grandparents. The review also found that looking at both confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in children aged six to 10, 32% were asymptomatic. When children did have symptoms they tended to be ""more mild"", with the most common features a cough and fever, followed by upper respiratory tract symptoms such as a runny nose and sore throat. About 10% had diarrhoea and/or vomiting, with some only having those symptoms. The researchers found that children were ""significantly less affected"" than adults, with only 0.6% of younger children diagnosed with the disease having become critically ill. They added: ""To date, deaths remain extremely rare in children from COVID-19, with only a handful of reported cases."" When it comes to newborns, the review looked at the nearly 50 cases reported and said the majority of newborns whose mothers have tested positive for COVID-19 have not contracted it. Of the few cases of newborns testing positive - one at 36 hours of age - none have suffered any complications and needed minimal respiratory support, it added.",1,
376,Facebook cancels its in-person events from now until June 2021,Jack Morse,"Facebook is socially distancing itself from you. Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant's CEO, announced Thursday that the company is preemptively canceling most in-person events through the summer of 2021. And yes, the coronavirus is to blame. In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg explained that any and all Facebook events with over 50 people in attendance would be nixed until June of next year. That, of course, includes the company's annual F8 developer conference typically held in the spring. Facebook canceled the 2020 F8 back in February, but today's announcement shows that the company doesn't think it will be safe to gather in large groups for at least another 14 or so months. ""Even beyond this next period, guidance from health experts is that it won't be advisable to have large groups of people get together for a while,"" wrote Zuckerberg. ""Given this, we're canceling any large physical events we had planned with 50 or more people through June 2021."" Notably, Zuckerberg also said that the ""vast majority"" of Facebook's workforce will remain working remotely ""at least"" through May. ""A small percent of our critical employees who can't work remotely, like content reviewers working on counter-terrorism or suicide and self-harm prevention, and engineers working on complex hardware, may be able to return sooner, but overall, we don't expect to have everyone back in our  offices for some time,"" added the CEO. Facebook had been criticized for requiring some of its contract content reviewers to still physically come into an office. That some form of a return to normalcy is a year off for Facebook fits neatly with the timeline for the estimated development of a vaccine. That is, experts think a vaccine is 12 to 18 months out, and, until then, some form of social distancing or scaled-down events may be required. At this early stage, canceling events of over 50 people seems like a cautious but responsible move.

484,UK regulator clears Amazon stake in coronavirus-hit Deliveroo - Reuters,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazonâ€™s purchase of a stake in Deliveroo has been provisionally cleared by Britainâ€™s competition regulator in view of a potentially fatal deterioration in the online food delivery groupâ€™s finances because of the coronavirus pandemic. Amazon led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo in May, making what the two parties called â€œa minority investmentâ€ and pitching it against Uber Eats and Takeaway.com in the global race to dominate the market for takeaway meal deliveries. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a detailed investigation in December, saying the deal could damage competition by discouraging Amazon from re-entering the online restaurant food market and further developing its presence within the online convenience grocery delivery market. However, the CMA said on Friday it had become clear that the health emergency was having a significant negative impact on Deliverooâ€™s revenues, given the closure of a large number of the restaurants available through its platform during the lockdown. The regulator said Deliveroo informed it the impact of the pandemic on its business meant it would fail financially and exit the market without the Amazon investment. â€œWithout additional investment, which we currently think is only realistically available from Amazon, itâ€™s clear that Deliveroo would not be able to meet its financial commitments and would have to exit the market,â€ Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMAâ€™s independent inquiry group, said. He said Deliverooâ€™s demise could leave some customers cut off from online food delivery, with others facing higher prices or a reduction in service quality. â€œFaced with that stark outcome, we feel the best course of action is to provisionally clear Amazonâ€™s investment in Deliveroo,â€ he said. Deliveroo said it was delighted with the CMAâ€™s decision. â€œThis investment will help us to overcome immediate and long-term challenges,â€ a spokeswoman said. Amazon had no immediate comment. The CMA is seeking views on its provisional findings by May 11. The deadline for its final report is June 11. Reporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton, Stephen Addison and Barbara Lewis",0,
92,"Tom Hanks, 65, Passes Away, Confessed Admiration for Trump at the End",Harry Helmet,"Prolific acting legend, Tom Hanks, passed away suddenly this morning. The cause of his death has not been released. Hanks enjoyed a long and successful career. He was well-liked by all those in the Hollywood community and his movies were always well received by the public, even the really crappy ones like “Castaway.” His body of work will live on for decades to come.

For the past several years, Hanks had been been very vocal with his opposition to President Trump. He often called the president names, none of which can be printed here, and when he did so, he made sure that his comments were broadcast far and wide for the public to hear. His deep hatred for President Trump has been very well known. Of course, we all know why he said those things about Trump. Hanks was known to be a frequent visitor to Epstein Island and so he knew that the president was coming for him. His using all that energy on discrediting Trump’s every move was clearly an attempt to have him removed from office which would then allow him to stay free from prison.

While on his deathbed, however, Hanks must have realized that there was no point in carrying on the ruse any longer. According to his wife, Tom made a deathbed confession, the likes of which no one would have ever expected.

In it, he confessed his love for President Trump and all his accomplishments to date. He went so far as to say that the president was “really really great“ and that Trump “was the best possible choice for America. He’s done stellar work so far.” His wife, Rita, was impressed by his honesty at the end but said that she wished he had told her all that years ago so that she could have “dumped his trumpy ass.”

The world has lost an iconic acting legend, but that’s not all. This revelation from Tom shows that we have also lost a future vote for Trump.",1,
437,America is in crisis. We need universal basic income now | Karl Widerquist | Opinion | The Guardian,Karl Widerquist,"A few members of Congress recently have suggested that the United States government institute an emergency Universal Basic Income (UBI) in response to the twin crises of coronavirus and the stock market collapse, which many economists believe could signal the start of a significant recession. UBI provides an unconditional sum of money from the government for permanent residents whether or not they work. Proposals for an emergency UBI vary. One common suggestion from lawmakers is $1,000 a month for adults and $500 a month for children for four months or more if the coronavirus persists. This amount would be an enormous help in this crisis. Iâ€™ve studied UBI for more than 20 years, and I find that opposition to it usually comes down to two main arguments: that everyone should work or that we simply canâ€™t afford it. Whether these are valid or invalid arguments against UBI in normal times has been debated for decades, but they simply donâ€™t apply to the emergency UBI during the current situation. Right now, we donâ€™t need everyone to work. In fact, we need a lot of people to stop working. We donâ€™t want food service and healthcare workers who might be sick to go into work and infect people because they canâ€™t afford to stay home. In an economy where millions of people live paycheck-to-paycheck, an emergency UBI would give non-essential employees the opportunity to stay home during the coronavirus outbreak, slowing the spread of the disease. The more people we have who can afford to stay home the better off weâ€™ll be, at least for the duration of the outbreak. Most economists will agree that the economy needs injections of cash right now. When economies slide into recession, there is a â€œmultiplier effectâ€ as people lose their jobs and businesses contract, they spend less. Other people then lose their jobs or contract their businesses, and this multiplier effect continues. The economy shrinks, income declines, and money literally disappears from circulation. Governments can help stop this process by creating money and injecting it into circulation. After the 2008-2009 economic meltdown, the United States government and governments around the world created trillions of dollars worth of currency out of thin air and injected it into the economy, usually by buying back their own debt, in an effort to stimulate demand and reverse the multiplier effect. Buying back government debt isnâ€™t necessarily the best way to stimulate the economy, however. The money goes mostly to people who are already rich, and they have very little incentive to invest that money when everyone else is losing income. An emergency UBI is just about the best economic stimulator that exists in modern times because it gets money in the hands of everyone. No oneâ€™s income would go to zero due to stock market-related layoffs or corona-related precautions. That income helps people maintain some of their spending, which helps prevent others from losing their jobs through the multiplier effect. Congress should act now. An emergency UBI, providing $1,000 per adult and $500 per child, per month, for four months or as long as the outbreak lasts, can help everyone get through this critical time. The sooner our government acts, the sooner we start to recover. We donâ€™t know how bad coronavirus will get. We shouldnâ€™t have to worry about how we will be able to buy food and pay rent as well. The economy needs more money and less labor. We need people to spend money. And we donâ€™t need them to work for it. Karl Widerquist, an associate professor of philosophy at Georgetown Universityâ€™s School of Foreign Service in Qatar, is a founding editor of the journal Basic Income Studies. He is the author of eight books including, A Critical Analysis of Basic Income Experiments, Prehistoric Myths in Modern Political Philosophy, and Independence, Propertylessness, and Basic Income: A Theory of Freedom as the Power to Say No",0,
11,Breaking news: China will admit coronavirus coming from its P4 lab,GM35,"The Chinese Communist Party will finally admit that the real source of the coronavirus is from “a lab in Wuhan” linked to its covert biological weapon programs.
As the “novel” coronavirus originated in Wuhan is spreading to ten countries, more and more people including international bio-weapon experts are questioning its link to the Wuhan P4 lab located about 20 miles from a seafood market where the first few cases of human infections were found.
A reliable source, one of the Chinese kleptocrats, told Miles Guo today that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will admit to the public of an “accidental” leak of lab-created virus from a P4 lab in Wuhan to put blames on “human errors”. But the official announcement is still being finalized.
Initially, the Chinese communist’s propaganda machines were blaming the virus on wild animals like bats by showing many videos of people eating bats.
In January 2018, a bio-safety level four (BSL-4) laboratory was built in the city of Wuhan, which focuses on the control of emerging diseases and stores purified SARS and other types of viruses. It is supposed to act as a WHO ‘reference laboratory’ linked to similar labs around the world.
Here is a Chinese video of the P4 lab which took over ten years to build:
The remaining question is whether the Chinese Communist Party leaked the virus on purpose as a desperate attempt to stay in power. There is no final conclusion yet, but the Chinese Communist Party acted suspiciously before, during and after the first case of Wuhan pneumonia:
Wang Qishan visited Wuhan secretly during the time of the first “sign” of the deadly virus.
The Chinese top kleptocrats like Han Zheng did not respond to any early reports of the mysterious Wuhan pneumonia sent by the government of Hubei province.
The Chinese government deliberately covered up and delayed the reporting and containment of the mysterious pneumonia.
The Chinese kleptocrat Wang Qishan, the Vice President of China, told his friend confidently that the outbreak would end in February while the epidemic is spreading out of control.
The Chinese government deliberately abandon the residents, patients and medical staff at the epicenter without providing food, medical supplies or protective gear.
The Chinese top kleptocrats handle the outbreak with a nonchalant attitude. Instead of talking or acting in ways to show concerns, they were celebrating Chinese New Year as if nothing has happened.
The Chinese government has not done a lot to reduce the spread of the disease except for sending military forces to prevent people from escaping their cities or villages on lockdown.
The Chinese government allows the fear to spread nationally and internationally to create an almost doomsday-like scene.
The Chinese government rejected aid, monitoring, donation or assistance from the WHO to keep the epidemic in a black box.",1,

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is desperate to sign a striker to lead the line after failing to replace Romelu Lukaku with a permanent addition since his exit last summer. Manchester United have accepted the financial uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic will leave them unable to spend the money needed to sign Kane. The Tottenham superstar sparked speculation over his future last month when he admitted he would not stay at the club â€œfor the sake of itâ€. He warned: â€œIâ€™m an ambitious player, I want to improve, get better and become one of the top, top players. It all depends on what happens as a team and how we progress as a team. So itâ€™s not a definite Iâ€™m going to stay there forever, but itâ€™s not a no either.â€ The Guardian claim Kane would cost in the region of Â£150million but Old Trafford chiefs have decided a swoop is unrealistic because of concerns over the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis.

""If Harry Kane is available, even for a record price, United would be mad not to look a gift horse in the mouth.

President Donald Trump said at a press conference that his administration is looking at helping rural hospitals which have been hurt very badly. He also said he was going to use the Defense Production Act to increase swab production at one facility amid coronavirus testing shortage. The president's announcement comes after governors demanded federal help to ramp up testing across the U.S. â€”Riya Bhattacharjee, Noah Higgins-Dunn Ireland is highly unlikely to allow large gatherings this year and the ""cocooning"" of people over 70 years old in their homes may persist for quite a while, Health Minister Simon Harris said on Sunday. ""What's not going to come back quickly are scenarios in which we can't safely socially distance,"" Harris told the Sunday Independent newspaper in an interview. ""I can't see how people can be in packed pubs again as long as this virus is still with us and we don't have a vaccine or an effective treatment."" Ireland's chief medical officer declared on Thursday that the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak had been contained in the population at large. That raised hopes that stay-at-home restrictions could begin to be rolled back from May 5. But Harris cautioned that any easing back of the most severe constraints will be done on a slow and phased basis. ""I'd like to see a situation where you could expand somewhat the areas in which people can go beyond their home,"" he said. â€”Reuters Neiman Marcus is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week, becoming the first major U.S. department store operator to succumb to the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, people familiar with the matter said. The debt-laden Dallas-based company has been left with few options after the pandemic forced it to temporarily shut all 43 of its Neiman Marcus locations, roughly two dozen Last Call stores and its two Bergdorf Goodman stores in New York. Neiman Marcus is in the final stages of negotiating a loan with its creditors totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, which would sustain some of its operations during bankruptcy proceedings, according to the sources. It has also furloughed many of its roughly 14,000 employees. â€”Reuters Health ministers from the Group of 20 major economies discussed weaknesses in health systems that made the world vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak and other pandemics, a statement said after a virtual meeting on Sunday. The Saudi G20 secretariat said that the ministers shared their national experiences, addressed necessary actions to improve preparedness and discussed systemic weaknesses exposed by the pandemic. ""Health Ministers recognised that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted systemic weaknesses in health systems,"" the statement said. ""It also has shown vulnerabilities in the global community's ability to prevent and respond to pandemic threats."" The statement said the ministers adopted preventative measures to contain the pandemic, but did not elaborate. A planned virtual news conference was cancelled as Saudi Health Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah had to attend ""an urgent Covid-19 KSA (Saudi) taskforce meeting."" Saudi Arabia is the current chair of the G20. In opening remarks provided via video to media, Rabiah said urgent actions included the need for collaboration and engagement of global organisations for coordinated responses to the novel coronavirus pandemic, with an emphasis on supporting countries in need, and investing in research and discovery to produce technology, tools, vaccines and therapies. â€”Reuters United Airlines has struck a deal with an Asian aircraft leasing firm to sell and then lease back 22 aircraft. Neither United nor the Bank of China Aviation revealed the financial terms of the deal announced Sunday morning. The move will help United conserve cash and give its balance sheet greater flexibility as it faces mounting losses due to coronavirus causing a global plunge in airline travel. Earlier this week, United CEO Oscar Munoz said business has essentially dropped to zero. ""We expect to fly fewer people during the entire month of May than we did on a single day in May 2019,"" Munoz wrote in a note to employees outlining plans to cut its schedule by 90% in May. â€”Phil LeBeau The coronavirus has now killed more than 40,000 people in the U.S., nearly a quarter of all deaths from Covid-19 across the globe, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The coronavirus has infected more than 735,000 people in the U.S., the most of any country. While the number of deaths continues to climb, President Donald Trump has said that officials now expect the total death toll to be ""substantially under"" initial estimates, which indicated the U.S. could see at least 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. The number of deaths in New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the nation, have been on the decline in the past week, although the state is still recording over 500 deaths a day, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Globally, more than 162,000 people have died from the virus. â€”Noah Higgins-Dunn India's Maharashtra state, the country's largest regional economy, will allow a limited number of sectors to resume business on Monday, after a weeks-long shutdown to slow the spread of coronavirus left millions out of work. Maharashtra, home to financial centre Mumbai, has the biggest share of India's caseload of 15,713 infections, including a large number now ripping through its densely-packed slums. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray told a news conference on Sunday that some activity would be permitted in the least-affected parts of the state while observing a strict lockdown in the red zones that have the maximum number of cases. ""We need to start the economic wheels again. We are giving selective permissions from tomorrow, especially in orange zones and green zones,"" he said, referring to areas with lower levels of infection. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended the nationwide lockdown that began late last month until May 3, but the federal government has allowed states to restart activity as amid economic distress in rural areas. â€”Reuters New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that the state plans to roll out antibody testing this week to determine who has been infected with Covid-19, conducting the ""largest survey of any state population that has been done."" Cuomo said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the state's antibody test, which is designed to detect whether a person has developed the antibodies to fight Covid-19 and indicates they may be immune against the disease, and said the state will conduct ""thousands"" of tests this week. ""We'll take thousands of tests, antibody tests, over this next week all across the state to give us a real snapshot, a real baseline, of exactly how many people were infected by coronavirus and have the antibodies,"" Cuomo said. ""So we'll have the first real statistical number on exactly where we are as a population."" The antibody tests will give the state its ""first true snapshot"" of how many people in the state have been infected with Covid-19, Cuomo said. Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor, later tweeted that the state antibody testing will begin on Monday and will sample 3,000 people. â€”Noah Higgins-Dunn Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday said the problems surrounding the delayed coronavirus tests from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control at the beginning of the nation's outbreak were resolved by early February. On Saturday, The Washington Post reported that the CDC's coronavirus testing kits were delayed due to ""a glaring scientific breakdown"" at the agency's central lab. The error was ""devastating to the country"" and ""really a terrible black mark on the CDC,"" James Le Duc, a former CDC officer, told The Post. Pence, speaking with NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" said he saw the reports but believes the issues surrounding that particular test were resolved by early February. He added that those ""slow, lab-based tests"" that are typically conducted by the CDC and the states' public health labs would ""never have been able to meet the testing in this coronavirus epidemic."" â€”Noah Higgins-Dunn Wynn Resorts Chief Executive Officer Matt Maddox on Sunday called on the Nevada governor to begin to reopen the Las Vegas Strip in mid- to late May with extensive safety measures in place, assuming the state is in line with certain benchmarks around the spread of the coronavirus. In an opinion column published on the Nevada Independent news website, Maddox said Governor Steve Sisolak should reopen parts of the local economy in early May. ""Begin with reduced occupancy, physical distancing measures in place, temperature checks and no large gatherings,"" Maddox wrote. ""We all need to wear a mask."" He also laid out Wynn's health and safety guidelines for reopening, which include allowing a maximum of four people to ride in an elevator at one time; and requiring guests to enter the resort through doors that are either propped open, are automated or manually operated by an employee. Sisolak ordered all casinos and other nonessential businesses in the state to close for 30 days beginning March 18. He extended that order until April 30, and last week said he has no specific date for when nonessential businesses might be allowed to reopen. In Nevada, there have been at least 3,725 people confirmed to have the coronavirus and 155 deaths. â€”Reuters New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Sunday said that the state is ""past the high point"" of coronavirus cases as data shows a decline in the rate of infection.""If the data holds and if this trend holds, we are past the high point and all indications at this point are that we are on a descent,"" Cuomo said at a press briefing. ""We are on the other side of the plateau and the numbers are coming down.""The governor said that 507 people died of the virus in New York in the last 24 hours, down from 540 deaths reported on Saturday, which marks the state's lowest daily death toll in over two weeks.Still, 1,300 people were hospitalized on Saturday Cuomo said. At least 13,869 people have died in New York, the epicenter of the virus.""It's no time to get cocky, and it's no time to get arrogant,"" Cuomo said. ""We still have a long, long way to go and a lot of work to do."" â€”Emma Newburger Spain's death toll from the new coronavirus outbreak rose by 410 on Sunday, the lowest daily increase in about a month in one of the world's hardest hit countries, prompting cautious optimism from the government that the figures are on a downward path. The daily increase in deaths was the lowest since March 22. It is far below the highest daily increase - 950 deaths reported on April 2 - in a sign of a slowdown of the spread of the virus after Spain imposed a strict lockdown in mid-March. The total number of deaths reached 20,453 on Sunday, the Health Ministry said. It is the third-highest toll worldwide after the United States and Italy. The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 195,944 from 191,726 on Saturday. Health workers account for 15.6% of those infected, health emergency chief Fernando Simon told a press briefing. ""Data confirms the breaking of the curve, even with an increased number of tests,"" said health minister Salvador Illa, referring to the evolution of the death toll. ""It is still a difficult stage, but we are going in the right direction"". Spain is conducting around 40,000 coronavirus tests daily, one of the highest numbers among European countries, Illa said. Close to a million tests had been conducted as of April 13. â€”Reuters New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo renewed his call to the federal government for $500 billion in aid to the country's state and local governments whose funding has been exhausted from the coronavirus outbreak. The National Governors Association, a bipartisan group of U.S. governors, has called on Congress to allocate relief funding for state governments to offset drastic revenue shortfalls. Previous relief funding legislation didn't provide funding to offset the states' drastic revenue shortfalls, and any lack of future aid could result in reduced funding for schools, police and fire departments, transit systems and even hospitals, Cuomo said. He said that New York is looking at cutting education funding by nearly 50%, as well as funding cuts for the state's hospitals. ""You're talking about cuts to hospitals from the state,"" Cuomo said. ""I mean how ludicrous would it be to now cut hospital funding from state governments?"" On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House and Congress could reach a deal today on supplemental funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to provide additional funding for small businesses, although money for state and local governments will not be included in the package. Mnuchin said President Trump is prepared to discuss funding for state and local governments in the next bill. â€”Noah Higgins-Dunn Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican and chair of the National Governors Association, dismissed as ""absolutely false"" Trump administration claims that states have adequate coronavirus testing capacity to begin gradually reopening their economies. Hogan, speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" described the lack of testing as the biggest problem in the nation since the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States. The Maryland governor said he has ""repeatedly"" made that argument on behalf of America's governors on both sides of the political aisle to leaders in Washington. ""The administration I think is trying to ramp up testing, they are doing some things with respect to private labs, but to try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just to get to work on testing, somehow we are not doing our job â€” is just absolutely false,"" said Hogan, who once considered challenging Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination. â€”Anna Hecht The coronavirus situation in France is improving ""slowly but surely,"" French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said, while warning that the health crisis was far from over. Philippe said there were signals that pressures on hospitals were easing, after the number of people in intensive care dropped for several days in a row. France, which has recorded close to 20,000 deaths as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, has been in virtual lockdown for nearly five weeks, but is due to start easing some confinement measures from May 11. Philippe said that an economic crisis was only just starting as a result of the outbreak, adding that it would be ""brutal."" â€”Reuters Pope Francis is urging the faithful to use the coronavirus pandemic's ""time of trial"" to prepare for a future where inequalities are abolished and the poorest are no longer left behind. ""This is not some ideology,"" Francis said. ""It is Christianity."" Francis traveled a few blocks outside the Vatican walls on Sunday to celebrate Mass at a nearby church to mark a special feast day dedicated to mercy. Only a few priests were in the pews given Italy's strict virus lockdown. While people infected with the coronavirus often experience mild or moderate symptoms, possible complications like pneumonia can put their lives at risk. In his homily, Francis said the grave, global toll of the pandemic has reminded the world that there are no borders between those who suffer, no differences in nationalities among those who are struck or spared. ""We are all frail, all equal, all precious,"" he said. ""May we be profoundly shaken by what is happening all around us,"" he said from the altar of the Santo Spirito church. ""The time has come to eliminate inequalities, to heal the injustice that is undermining the health of the entire human family!"" â€”Associated Press Deaths from the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy rose by 433 on Sunday, the lowest daily tally in a week, and the number of new cases also slowed to 3,047 from a previous 3,491, the Civil Protection Agency said. The death toll had risen by 482 on Saturday, down from 575 on Friday. The daily tallies of deaths and cases extend the broadly stable situation in place over the last two weeks. This plateau is down considerably from peaks reached around the end of March, but the downtrend has not proceeded as fast as was hoped in a country that has been in lockdown for almost six weeks. Sunday's number of deaths marked the lowest daily rise since April 12, when it came in at 431, before rising again during the week. The total death toll since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21 rose to 23,660, the second highest in the world after that of the United States. Total confirmed cases stood at 178,972. â€”Reuters America's department stores are on a sinking ship, racing for a lifeboat that might not be big enough for all of them. For J.C. Penney, the bankruptcy clock is ticking after it skipped a mid-April interest payment. Its turnaround plans have been sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced the closure of all of its stores. Macy's, with liquidity drying up, has tapped advisors at investment bank Lazard and law firm Kirkland & Ellis to explore options that include new financing. Nordstrom in early April raised $600 million by placing a handful of its real estate assets into a separate company and borrowing against the new entity by issuing bonds. High-end department store chain Neiman Marcus also on April 15 missed a payment on some of its bonds, according to a letter sent to the retailer's board from Marble Ridge Capital, which owns a significant portion of the $137.7 million in bonds that mature in October 2021. Neiman Marcus now has until the middle of May to make the interest payment. After that, pending no payment, the company could be pushed into bankruptcy court by its bondholders. The company is currently preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week, Reuters reported Sunday morning. A spokesperson for Neiman Marcus declined to comment. â€”Lauren Thomas The coronavirus epidemic has so ravaged travel, live entertainment and physical retail that companies across those industries have frozen their marketing, causing ad prices to plunge.

The ship, the Costa Deliziosa, was heading Sunday toward a port in Spain before ending its journey in Italy â€” both countries devastated by the coronavirus outbreak. Costa Crociere, an Italian cruise company, said that the Deliziosa, which set sail from Venice in early January with 1,831 passengers, had no cases of COVID-19 aboard. The Deliziosa, a nearly 300-meter (1,000-foot) vessel, will disembark 168 Spanish passengers on Monday at Barcelona's port. Then the Deliziosa will head to its final destination, Genoa, Italy, where it is expected to let off the remaining passengers, Italians and those of other nationalities, on Wednesday. A company spokesman said a passenger left the ship earlier in the week in Marsala, Sicily, for health issues and had a COVID-19 test, which was negative. Being on the liner for weeks during the pandemic ""was not surreal, it was incredible,'' said passenger Carlos Paya', who lives in Valencia, Spain, and is sailing with his wife. He added that they have family members in Spain. â€”Associated Press The total number of people killed by the coronavirus in Canada rose by just under 12% to 1,506 in a day, official data posted by the public health agency showed on Sunday. In a statement posted shortly before 11:00 eastern time (1500 GMT), it said the figure for those diagnosed with the coronavirus had climbed to 33,922. The respective figures on Saturday were 1,346 deaths and 32,412 positive diagnoses. â€”Reuters The unparalleled decision a month ago to close the state-owned stores that sell nearly all of Pennsylvania's liquor and much of its wine prompted some people to drive across state lines to stock up, risking a misdemeanor charge. Although Ohio, West Virginia and Delaware have cracked down, vehicles with Pennsylvania tags continue to crowd liquor store parking lots in New York, New Jersey and Maryland border towns amid continuing restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf began closing businesses in March, and the Liquor Control Board, after consulting with him, soon shut down its retail outlets. Many liquor cabinets are running low and the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board's pivot to online sales has been, for most, an exercise in frustration in a state of nearly 13 million people. ""Most people don't have a large store of liquor in their house. For one thing, it's expensive,"" said alcohol writer Lew Bryson, of Langhorne. ""I think people are running out of their daily drink, and that's putting the pressure on."" A couple weeks after the outlets closed, the liquor board restarted its meager online sales system, ramping up this past week by bringing back some workers to fill boxes for home delivery. Before the pandemic, the state liquor board did about 180,000 daily transactions, but as workers began returning, it had only been able to fill more than 4,000 online orders a day. On Saturday, the board announced 175 of the nearly 600 stores will begin taking orders by phone starting Monday for curbside service, with each customer limited to six bottles. â€”Associated Press Following a rush for groceries and cleaning supplies, more Americans are looking to crack open a book. As people remain sheltered in their homes due to the coronavirus outbreak, online shopping has surged as a replacement for an old-fashioned trip to the store. In addition to the overall boom in e-commerce spending, sales data reveals that following an initial stockpiling of goods, many online shoppers have shifted their focus to entertainment products such as books and games as they adjust to the new normal of life in quarantine. E-commerce spending in the U.S. is up more than 30% from the beginning of March through mid-April compared with the same period last year, according to market research firm Rakuten Intelligence. That is significantly more growth â€” about 50% more â€” than the annual 20% growth in online shopping the firm has become accustomed to seeing in recent years. This snapshot of the economy paints a picture of both what Americans are buying and how shopper priorities have shifted over the course of the extended quarantine period. â€”Nate Rattner Sports may no longer be blaring on television screens across the country, but that's not deterring some gamblers from placing bets on anything that they can get odds on -- table tennis, comments made during presidential debates, even video game sports competitions. This year was supposed to be a huge growth opportunity for sites like FanDuel and DraftKings, who are pushing to get licensed in more states across the country. Seventeen states have legalized sports betting, and many others have proposed state bills that would make them legal in coming years. DraftKings is pushing forward with a plan to become a publicly traded entity through a reverse merger with Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company. But that was before the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic shut down nearly every major sporting event. Gamblers have nowhere else to turn, as U.S. casinos are closed, so online sports books are searching for new and creative wagers to keep customers engaged. This month's NFL Draft will provide a boost. Sportsbooks have come up with about 150 different proposition bets around the NFL Draft -- about three times more than ever before, said Chad Milmann, The Action Network's chief content officer. â€”Alex Sherman, Jabari Young New work from home set-ups and a goodwill tour by the Big Tech companies are unlikely to soften the nation's top antitrust agencies on the industry, legal experts say. Up until recently, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple had been met with unyielding scrutiny in Washington and most state attorneys general offices, barraged by questions of dominance and privacy violations. Facebook and Google have been most visibly pursued by federal authorities and state attorneys. But as the coronavirus pandemic shut down business as usual, tech companies gained a chance to win back some goodwill. The companies have donated millions of dollars toward efforts to fight the virus, helped health officials spread their messages to encourage a flattening of the curve and donated their stockpiles of personal protective equipment. Amazon, in particular, has become even more important to Americans who want all their needs delivered to their doors.â€”Lauren Feiner Politicians in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government signaled further support for struggling businesses and consumers in the coronavirus crisis, focusing on hotels, restaurants and pay for short-time workers. Dehoga, an industry association that includes a large share of often small family-owned operations, told Bild am Sonntag that some 70,000 restaurant and hotel operators, which employ 223,000 people, could face insolvency as they stood to lose up to 10 billion euros of sales by the end of April. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier of Merkel's conservative party said in an interview with the same newspaper he agreed the sector needed support to get up on its feet again. ""It is clear that we will need additional help to prevent a large part of these companies giving up and disappearing from the market,"" he said. â€”Reuters New York's daily toll of coronavirus deaths has hit its lowest point in more than two weeks, but officials still warn that New York City and the rest of the state aren't ready to ease up on shutdowns of schools, businesses and gatherings. As of Saturday, the number of coronavirus deaths in New York state dropped under 550 for the first time in over two weeks as hospitalizations continue to decline. But the crisis is far from over: Hospitals are still reporting nearly 2,000 new COVID-19 patients per day, and nursing homes remain a ""feeding frenzy for this virus,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. While the crush of patients has eased somewhat in emergency rooms, ""that doesn't mean happy days are here again,"" Cuomo said at a news briefing. ""We are not at a point when we are going to be reopening anything immediately."" The state logged 540 deaths Friday from COVID-19, the lowest number since April 1. Nearly 13,000 New Yorkers have died since the state's first coronavirus case was reported March 1, the governor said. The state total doesn't include more than 4,000 New York City deaths that were blamed on the virus on death certificates but weren't confirmed by a lab test. â€”Associated Press The federal government has flexed its muscle to blunt the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic, and most voters back the intervention. As Congress looks to build on the largest emergency spending plan in U.S. history, 63% of registered voters said they approve of the expansion of the government's role in the economy in response to the outbreak, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday found. Another 30% of respondents said they disapproved. The survey reflects comfort with federal influence on the economy during crises usually unseen during calmer periods, when more voters sound the alarm about budget deficits or overreach. Even so, those concerns have not fully evaporated during the current economic freefall. Nearly half, or 48% of respondents, said they worry more about the government spending too much money to buoy the economy and driving up budget deficits, the poll found. Another 40% of voters said they were concerned the U.S. would disburse too little money and extend an economic recession. â€”Jacob Pramuk If Amazon dominated the retail market before the coronavirus pandemic began, there's good reason to believe it'll emerge from the crisis even stronger. Under orders to stay home, millions of Americans have turned to online marketplaces like Amazon to order much-needed essentials like toilet paper, food, hand sanitizer and cold medicine. In lieu of neighborhood supermarkets, consumers are relying on online grocery delivery services like Amazon Fresh, resulting in a cascade of delays and out-of-stock notices amid the unexpected rise in demand. Amazon has hired more than 100,000 new warehouse and delivery workers since March to help manage the surge in orders, and it's planning to bring on 75,000 more workers. The unprecedented demand has propelled shares of Amazon to fresh highs. The stock hit an all-time high on April 16 and is up more than 28% for the year, compared with an 11% decline for the S&P 500. Investors have flocked to Amazon and other stay-at-home stocks like  Netflix and Zoom in recent months, as consumers have come to depend on their services amid the lockdown. The outlook is brighter than ever for Amazon. But its ascent is occurring against a worrying backdrop of financial turmoil in the retail industry and the broader economy. â€”Annie Palmer Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said the White House and Congress could reach a deal today on supplemental funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses. The $349 billion rescue loan program ran out of money on Thursday, just two weeks after it was launched. Republican and Democratic leaders have been struggling to agree on how to restore its funds as a slew of small American businesses are at risk of shutting down from the financial hit of the coronavirus pandemic. Mnuchin said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he's hopeful the deal on another $300 billion in small business funding will be passed in the Senate on Monday and in the House on Tuesday. The new deal will include $50 billion for disaster loans, $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for a federal testing program. Money for state and local governments will not be included in the package, Mnchunin said. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" she believed lawmakers are very close to a deal on approving extra money to help small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. ""We're close,"" Pelosi said. ""I think we're very close to an agreement. Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer say they favor more money for small businesses but also want more coronavirus response funds for state and local governments and hospitals, as well as food assistance for the poor. â€”Emma Newburger Britain is not considering lifting the lockdown imposed almost four weeks ago to control the coronavirus outbreak given ""deeply worrying"" increases in the death toll, a senior minister said. Britain is at or near the peak of a health crisis in which more than 15,000 people have died â€” the fifth highest national death toll of a pandemic linked to at least 150,000 deaths worldwide. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said a Buzzfeed report that the government was considering lifting the lockdown in phases over the coming months was not correct.

500,"'Mask, gown, gloves â€“Â none of that exists': Venezuela's coronavirus crisis | World news | The Guardian","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joe-parkin-daniels,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/clavel-rangel","There is no ideal time for a pandemic, but fewer countries are less equipped to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak than crisis-ridden Venezuela, warn doctors and public health experts. Bed shortages, a lack of isolation areas and short supplies of soap are already a daily reality at one hospital in Ciudad Guayana, a city in the countryâ€™s east. There is a nearby centre set up for the pandemic response but workers there say there are not enough ambulances to ferry patients. â€œWe are experts in crisis,â€ one health worker said. â€œBut the coronavirus is a whole other challenge and weâ€™ll need much more support.â€ Cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, reached 33 in Venezuela on Monday evening, following the first two confirmed cases three days earlier. The government responded with a quarantine in the capital, Caracas, and six other states, alongside travel bans. On Monday the regulation was extended to the whole country. But the outbreak could hardly come at a worse time for Venezuela, which despite boasting the planetâ€™s largest proven oil reserves remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant â€“ Venezuelaâ€™s central bank said inflation reached nearly 10,000% last year â€“ while shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies are routine. Hospitals regularly face power outages, while basic supplies â€“ from latex gloves to basic antibiotics â€“ are often hard to come by. Four and a half million people have fled Venezuela, with healthcare workers and disease specialists among them. Treatable diseases such as diphtheria, measles and malaria continue to spread in fertile conditions. â€œThe health system is completely weakened and without the capability or resources to respond to peopleâ€™s basic needs â€“ let alone an epidemiological situation like Covid-19,â€ said JosÃ© FÃ©lix Oletta, who served as Venezuelaâ€™s health minister from 1997 to 1999. A survey of doctors across the country carried out by the local NGO MÃ©dicos Unidos found that only 25% of respondents had reliable running water in their hospitals and clinics. Two-thirds said they did not have gloves, masks, soap, goggles or scrubs. At the University Hospital of Caracas 80% of health workers are without protective equipment to treat patients who could be contagious. â€œThe stretcher bearer should wear a face mask, a disposable gown and gloves; the orderly who collects the waste must wear glasses and gloves â€“ but none of that exists at the moment,â€ said Mauro Zambrano, a representative of the Union of Hospital and Clinic Workers. On Monday workers in at least two hospitals in Caracas were resorting to making their own masks from items that had been donated. â€œWe are looking for solutions,â€ Zambrano said. Hospitals across the country have started online campaigns to bring in supplies. Few know for certain how broken the health system is, owing to the opacity of the administration of the embattled president, NicolÃ¡s Maduro. The most recent epidemiological survey carried out by his health ministry was published in 2016. â€œWhen forces close to Maduro censor information, it is difficult to tell people what they need to know â€“ itâ€™s difficult to respond,â€ said JosÃ© Manuel Olivares, an opposition politician and doctor. â€œActions taken by Maduro to hurt the health system have made it a sad fact that the coronavirus pandemic will cause more deaths in Venezuela and the region.â€ Maduro, the leftwing successor to Hugo ChÃ¡vez, is resisting a challenge to his legitimacy from Juan GuaidÃ³, an opposition leader backed by the US and 50 other countries. The incumbent retains the key support of the military and remains allied with Russia, China and Cuba. It is unclear how the international community will respond to the outbreak in Venezuela, or which leader it would be prepared to work with. Maduro, announcing flight bans in response to the pandemic, said US sanctions were hurting his administrationâ€™s ability to buy medicines and foodstuffs. Feliciano Reyna, who runs an NGO in Caracas that distributes medications to those who cannot get them otherwise, predicts that the isolation measures announced by the Maduro government will also be hampered by the crisis. â€œWhen trash isnâ€™t collected, or there is no water to wash your hands, isolation at home can become unsanitary,â€ Reyna said. â€œWe are not at all well prepared.â€",0,
70,Covid-19: The Panic Is Worse Than the Pathogen,Tony Cartalucci,"The Corona Virus Disease 2019 or “Covid-19” is a coronavirus similar to the virus that causes pneumonia. Covid-19 is a danger to at-risk groups including the elderly and the chronically ill. 

If you are not elderly and if you are in good health you have virtually no chance of dying from it.
For the vast majority of the population, Covid-19 is no more dangerous than the common cold. This is backed up by statistics already being reported across Western publications and based on information derived from China’s outbreak where the virus first appeared.

Compared to cancer, heart disease, substance abuse, or car accidents – Covid-19 is relatively harmless. But it has been put in the spotlight by deliberately dishonest, selective reporting that focuses on generating hysteria by presenting out-of-context information to an ignorant and easily panicked public.

If there is no global concern or massive mobilization over cancer and heart disease – conditions that claim far more lives than any virus – why the sudden hysteria and “concern” .

Context is King 

According to StatNews.com in their article, “Lower death rate estimates for coronavirus, especially for non-elderly, provide glimmer of hope:”

The chance of someone with symptomatic Covid-19 dying varied by age, confirming other studies. For those aged 15 to 44, the fatality rate was 0.5%, though it might have been as low as 0.1% or as high as 1.3%. For people 45 to 64, the fatality rate was also 0.5%, with a possible low of 0.2% and a possible high of 1.1%. For those over 64, it was 2.7%, with a low and high estimate of 1.5% and 4.7%.

The chance of serious illness from coronavirus infection in younger people was so low, the scientists estimate a fatality rate of zero.

Healthline.com would report in their article, “Here’s How COVID-19 Compares to Past Outbreaks,” that the most affected groups are:

…adults over 65 with underlying health conditions; children seem to be spared and are experiencing milder symptoms (in China, children account for just 2.4 percent of cases)

If that isn’t convincing enough, simply scrutinize content you’re already reading – especially regarding Covid-19 deaths – and see how old and in what health those are in reportedly dying from Covid-19. Many paragraphs down – far from the hysteria-generating headlines – you will find that those dying are already chronically ill, advanced in age, and/or already at risk whether it was Covid-19 or the common cold.

When deaths are reported without context they easily create panic.

When the number of Covid-19 deaths are put into perspective in relation to past outbreaks – or even side-by-side with the annual common flu virus- we see just how unwarranted the current wave of hysteria is and how overreactions from governments are aimed more at saving face and assuaging public panic than preserving public health.

In Thailand where up to four deaths have been reported at the time of writing this article – the first case involved a man who already had Dengue fever – a serious, life-threatening tropical illness spread by mosquitoes. The other 3 cases involved a 70 year old with pre-existing tuberculosis, a 79 year old with multiple pre-existing chronic illnesses, and a 45 year old suffering from obesity and chronic diabetes.

All four individuals would be considered “at-risk” and should have been isolated from those potentially carrying not only Covid-19 – but any communicable disease at all including the common cold or flu.

Do these deaths warrant paralyzing an entire nation of 70 million people? Or closing entire businesses and costing billions in commerce? The damage measures made in reaction to hysteria will cause more damage to many more people and for a much longer duration than Covid-19 ever could on its own.

Common Sense Measures 

Measures should be put into place and resources invested into educating the public on how to isolate and protect at-risk individuals – efforts should be made to help those at risk isolate themselves and provisions – including investments in critical care equipment such as ventilators – made to handle the influx of at-risk patients who end up with Covid-19 regardless.

What should not be done – is the spread of panic, hysteria, and the imposition of draconian measures simply to assuage panic and hysteria – measures that will also gut the economy, impact millions of workers, and disrupt the lives of millions more who depend on the day-to-day functioning of society and who face little or no health risk upon contracting the virus.

These measures – ironically – are in turn fueling additional panic including hording and social tensions that are only compounding the damage “Covid-19 hysteria” is already having on society.

Who is Fueling Hysteria and Why? 

There is the vastly corrupt mass media who depends on public panic and hysteria at times like this to boost clicks and sell newspapers. They also seek to advance their agenda and that of their wealthy sponsors and enhance their grip over the public’s attention. The media is determined to spread hysteria to keep people fixated on their reportage, completely indifferent to the damage they are causing.

There are also political groups – partnered with the media – attempting to leverage and amplify the appearance of Covid-19 into an unprecedented crisis despite a lack of evidence to justify doing so. Their interest is not in ensuring the safety of the public or maintaining oversight of government efforts – but instead leveraging the resulting hysteria to chip away at ruling governments they seek to destabilize and replace.

Aiding them are US and European-funded fronts posing as “human rights” advocates and “independent media” outlets. Groups like “Human Rights Watch” have attacked governments for not taking decisive enough action – then complained when decisive action was taken as being too draconian and violating “human rights.”

These are interest groups that are never satisfied with the government’s response to Covid-19 because they are interest groups completely unconcerned with Covid-19 itself and its impact on public health – and instead – concerned only with how they can generate and leverage public hysteria to advance their entirely unrelated and self-serving political agenda. Again, this is done with complete indifference to the damage being done to society by doing so.

What has resulted is governments around the globe taking measures in reaction to public panic – not to fight the actual pathogen. While draconian efforts to isolate the entire population may work in slowing the spread of Covid-19 – is it worth paralyzing entire economies, costing billions in economic damage, disrupting the lives of hundreds of millions of people who – if contracting Covid-19 – will have what is essentially a cold for a week?

The answer should be an obvious “no.”

Now and in the Future 

The answer also isn’t “doing nothing.”

Again, at-risk groups can and should be protected. State resources should be mobilized to protect and isolate them from the general population and treat them in the worst case scenario should they contract the virus anyway. Public information campaigns should be mounted to encourage basic hygiene especially for those who may come in contact with at-risk individuals – something that should be done year-round and regardless of whatever strain of the cold or flu is prevalent at the time.

And just in case a genuinely deadly pathogen appears on the horizon, nations should invest in economic infrastructure that can thrive regardless – just in case nationwide containment ever truly is necessary. This includes investing in online commerce, delivery services, decentralized manufacturing, and localized food, water, and energy security measures – all measures that would make for a more resilient society regardless of the threats that may or may not appear in the future.

Panic has proven a greater enemy than the Covid-19 pathogen. That society can be crippled by politicians, political groups, and a corrupt mass media over what is essentially a slightly more virulent form of the common cold, says a lot about how the world currently works and what needs dire attention to fix.

From those driving needless hysteria to those caving into it at the cost of economic stability and the disruption of millions of ordinary lives – it’s clear that we face a precedent being set – one that will ensure virtually any excuse in the future can be used to cripple civilization on a global scale. It seems obvious this cannot be allowed to stand, but what is less clear is what can be done to ensure it does not.

It can be hoped that governments around the globe pressured by hysteria this time around will set up measures in the future to avoid caving in again.

For the average individual – knowing that virtually everything you read in the media is likely promoting an agenda and thus being misrepresented – gives you the ability to look for context and truth yourself and applying critical thinking skills – reducing your suseptibility to panic and hysteria – and innoculating us all against the real virus infecting society – a political and social virus.",1,
254,Comrade Crazy – Governor Gretchen Whitmer Claims She is Being Victimized By Citizens of Michigan…,Sundance,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer addressed the issue of her husband attempting to use his position to get their personal boat prepped and in the water prior to Memorial day so they could enjoy the holiday. The Michigan governor said her husband was joking when he told the boat storage operator he was the husband of the governor and asked if that would move him up in the line of requests. Additionally Governor Whitmer highlights how the citizens of Michigan are victimizing her; including scary men who have surrounded her home while carrying “automatic weapons.” Whitmer says the COVID-19 virus has created an undue hardship on her and her family, and she is burdened by hurt feelings and wounded sensibilities.  Whitmer personifies what happens when left-wing moonbats are allowed to gain political power. Additionally (below), Whitmer denies reports that her family violated her own stay-home orders and traveled to their second home. She insists her husband only traveled to their second home to rake leaves by moonlight for one, or, well, maybe two days… or something.

75,"IT WASN’T THE “VIRUS” THAT CRASHED THE ECONOMY, IT WAS THE PEOPLE WHO OBEYED",Mac Slavo,"Most atrocities in human history have all been committed by individuals and agents of government who were “just following orders” or “just obeying the law.” 

The virus didn’t give any orders. It was the people who obeyed the commands of tyrants that crashed the economy and ruined the livelihoods of others.

Most human beings still think like slaves. 

Instead of asking questions or using critical thinking skills to ask if something is right before doing it, they simply obey perceived “authority”.  The truth is, this lockdown is the fault of everyone who complied and everyone who used forced to exact revenge on those who disobeyed.  It was the same in all tyrannical takeovers in history. The mainstream media keeps blaming the economic devastation on the coronavirus, but it wasn’t the fault of a virus.  It was the fault of the government and the slave mentality of the police and the public willingly obeying their commands. Mainstream media outlets are still trying desperately to spin the narrative and fault the “invisible enemy” for the very real toll on human life the government’s overreaction has already caused.  This is nothing more than propaganda, and once you pick it up, you’ll be able to see it.  The media doesn’t want you to put the blame where it belongs and figure things out for yourself, so they hide behind deception headlines that will keep you in fear of COVID-19 as long as possible.

This is all a part of the larger plan to keep the public panicked about a virus and looking the other way when the tyrannical boots of the state come down on them.  We know this is what the media does, and we know they are doing it to keep the ruling class in power and the public panicked and in a constant state of fear so they will comply with any and all enslavement measures.

Larken Rose, the author of Most Dangerous Superstition, lays out just how horrifyingly devastating it is for humans to remain unevolved to the point that they will not say “no” to an immoral command. The primary threat to freedom and justice is not greed, or hatred, or any of the other emotions or human flaws usually blamed for such things. Instead, it is one ubiquitous superstition that infects the minds of people of all races, religions, and nationalities, which deceives decent, well-intentioned people into supporting and advocating violence and oppression. Even without making human beings one bit more wise or virtuous, removing that one superstition would remove the vast majority of injustice and suffering from the world. Instead of just blindly obeying the commands, think about it and ask if what you are doing is right. Do you have the moral right to take the rights of others? Applying even the most minimal amount of critical thinking to something can usually get people to what is right.  But you have to do be willing to take a look at yourself, and correct your mistakes yourself, and take responsibility for your own actions. Which is exactly why most Americans won’t.  Blaming a virus and blindly obeying the ruling class and it’s foot soldiers is much easier than critical thinking.

The police state and tyranny is brought to you by those willing to follow commands, regardless of the morality of the command.  Tyrants can’t have power without people willing to enforce the tyranny.  If there are no order followers, there are no orders.",1,

360,"Top 10 pound-for-pound boxing stars in the world, including Tyson Fury and Canelo Alvarez | Boxing | Sport | Express.co.uk",Matt Penn," It's often tricky trying to form your top 10 pound-for-pound fighters in the world list, but Express Sport have done their best in trying to do so. Stars such as Tyson Fury and Canelo Alvarez, make it onto our list, but who will the eight remaining spots go to? In tenth place, the legendary Filipino Manny Pacquiao, who just last year won another world title aged 40 when he beat Keith Thurman for the WBA welterweight belt. Pacquiao is an eight-division champion, but is now coming toward the end of his illustrious career. Probably the meanest fighter in boxing today, Artur Beterbiev, makes it in at number nine. The Russian WBC and IBF light-heavyweight world champion last fought when he TKO'd Oleksandr Gvozdyk in October. JUST IN: Anthony Joshua calls Deontay Wilder's CV 'mediocre'  It's not often you see heavyweights on this list, but Fury's huge victory over Deontay Wilder in February earns him a place on our list. Fury became a two-time heavyweight champion with his win and became just the third heavyweight in history to pick up the Ring Magazine belt on a second occasion, behind Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali. Golovkin would find himself higher on this list, but it's clear he's coming toward the end of his career now - after a sub-par showing against Sergiy Derevyanchenko in October. Golovkin arguably beat Canelo Alvarez twice, but with no official W on the record from those two bouts, we can't place him any higher. DONâ€™T MISS Tyson Fury promoter Frank Warren fires back at Deontay Wilder Anthony Joshua dishes high praise for trainer Rob McCracken Boxing news: Anthony Joshua the 'only' fighter who can beat Fury Spence Jr was impressive in his hard-fought win over Shawn Porter last September in Los Angeles. The Texan unified the WBC and IBF welterweight world titles, and is racking up some decent names on his resume, including Porter, Mikey Garcia, Kell Brook and Lamont Peterson. One of two undisputed world champions on this list - the scary Ukrainian Usyk, who has tested the waters once since his move up to heavyweight. Assuming he can win titles at heavyweight like he did at cruiserweight, Usyk will eventually find himself in the top four.  The Monster Inoue finds himself on the precipice of the top three on our list, having beaten Filipino Nonito Donaire in the WBSS bantamweight final in November. Inoue is a three-weight world champion and was due to face another Filipino in Johnriel Casemiro before the coronavirus pandemic halted those plans. Though a three-weight world champion with no losses on his record, Crawford only makes it at three because of his lack of formidable opponents. Crawford's biggest win was probably against Yuriorkis Gamboa several years ago and since then it's been plain-sailing for the Nebraskan. Alvarez could have been numero uno, but with a loss, two draws and a couple of other controversial decisions in his favour, two is the best we can do for the Mexican. But don't let that take away from his impressive resume. He's also a three-weight world champion, having beaten fighters such as Erislandy Lara, Amir Khan, Austin Trout, Miguel Cotto, Danny Jacobs, Gennady Golovkin and Sergey Kovalev. The Matrix himself, Lomachenko takes our No 1 spot, as he waits his chance to become undisputed world champion of the lightweight division when he faces Teofimo Lopez upon boxing's return. The Ukrainian's record doesn't look all that impressive at 14-1, but it is when you find that he's picked up world titles in three different weight classes in that short space of time.

499,"UK faces six more coronavirus lockdowns with 40,000 dead in just the first outbreak | UK | News | Express.co.uk",Oli Smith," The UK is bracing itself for six more waves of coronavirus lockdown measures, following a shock warning from a leading medical expert. Professor Anthony Costello, who also advises the Government on coronavirus, said that coronavirus could lead to 40,000 deaths in the first wave alone. He also warned that when the current lockdown ends, only ten percent of the UK population may be immune from the virus - leaving 90 percent still at risk of infection. BACK BRITAIN'S BRAVE NHS HEROES - CLICK HERE NOW Providing evidence to the House of Commons Health Committee, Professor Costello urged MPs to prepare the country for at least six more waves of outbreaks before a coronavirus vaccine is developed. He disputed foreign secretary Dominic Raab's claim that there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"". Prof Costello said the end of the first wave of infections would not mean a return to normal life. The former British WHO director also said that the UK will record the highest death total in Europe. JUST IN: EU regulations could ruin NHS coronavirus fight with crackdown on apps   He explained: â€œAfter this wave - and we could see 40,000 deaths by the time it is over - we could only have 10-15 percent of the population infected or covered. ""The idea of herd immunity would mean another five to six more waves to get to 60 percent. We have got to suppress this right down."" The expert from University College London went on to call for a massive programme of contact tracing â€“ including the use of smartphone apps to identify those who may have been at risk â€“ to shutdown the infection. Professor Costello said that a â€œcommunity protective shieldâ€ will be needed when the UK comes out of lockdown to prevent another large-scale outbreak. LETâ€™S GET CAPTAIN TOM MOORE A KNIGHTHOOD - SIGN THE PETITION HERE  He said that while the Government had acted ""too slow"" in its reaction, the country ""should have not hand out any blame at this stage"". The expert continued: ""If weâ€™re going to suppress the chain of transmission of this virus in the next stage we all hope that the national lockdown and social distancing will bring about a large suppression of the epidemic so far - but weâ€™re going to face further waves. ""And so we need to make sure that we have a system in place that cannot just do a certain number of tests in the laboratory, but has a system at district and community level.""

501,Arsenal stars close to agreeing wage cut after Mikel Arteta intervention to seek Â£25m deal | Football | Sport | Express.co.uk,Charlie Malam,"  Arsenal are close to resolving their pay cut row, according to reports. The Gunners are keen for their first-team squad to take a salary reduction to help the running over the club over the next 12 months. The coronavirus crisis is set to hit the Londoners as hard as any other team in the Premier League, with their American owners to be hit in the pocket due to the extra investment that will be required to build the SoFi Stadium for NFL outfit the Los Angeles Rams. And so Arsenal chiefs are looking to bring down the club's staggering wage bill to avoid them facing any problems with paying their non-playing staff. But earlier this week Mikel Arteta's team rejected a proposal from the club's hierarchy to take a 12.5 per cent cut to their salaries from April 2020 to March 2021. The Professional Footballers' Association have recommended players not to agree to pay cuts, having rejected a Premier League suggestion for a league-wide 30 per cent reduction.  Arteta personally intervened on Wednesday night, holding a lengthy conference call with his players in order to help find a resolution to the matter. Thirteen players voted in favour of the cuts while 14 voted against them, but now, The Athletic say that Arteta's chat with them has swayed their thinking. They said the Gunners are increasingly close to finalising an agreement to help cut down on their wage bill, which stands at Â£230million. That figure is less than only eight clubs across Europe despite having not played in the Champions League since the 2016-17 season. Arsenal players were initially confused as to why they were being asked to take cuts rather than a pay deferral, which would mean them being rebated the lost wages at a later date. But Arteta's direct address has convinced the majority of the squad to accept the cuts, which would see them become the first Premier League team to impose such sanctions. The 38-year-old promised to back his players whatever decision they chose upon, but also sought to explain the thinking behind the club's strategy. The cuts would not come into place whatsoever if the English top-flight returns and Arsenal secure a spot in next season's Champions League. Meanwhile qualifying for the Europa League would see the cut in salaries drop from 12.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. The Athletic report that it is not yet certain what will happen to those players who rejected the proposals. Arsenal's squad were hoping to agree a 20 per cent pay deferral and wanted assurances that non-playing staff would be protected and that players who are sold by the club in the summer receive their lost income in full.  They feared that the cut was part of a long-term plan to trim down the club's wage bill, described as a ""Champions League wage bill on a Europa League budget"" by director Josh Kroenke. But Arsenal bosses are confident that reductions will enable them to better plan for the next 12 months and beyond, whereas a deferral would only delay the repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis. It has not yet been officially signed off but is increasingly likely to happen. And Arsenal players are also said to be open to donating a month of their wages to help make certain non-playing staff do not lose their employment, with Arteta having posed that idea to the squad on Wednesday night. In a statement on the same day, Arsenal said: ""The suspension of football and the broader global economic impact of the virus mean that many of our revenue streams are on hold or are at risk. ""We have always aimed to operate on the basis that the money we earn is reinvested in the team, the wider club and invested into our community. ""The potential impact on our revenue streams puts our operating model under pressure. ""We know that this crisis will pass, and normality will resume, but timeframes cannot be known with any certainty. ""The potential financial impact is significant so we must be responsible and act now to best protect Arsenal from what might happen in the months ahead. ""What is clear is that this is one of the most challenging periods in our near 134-year history. Our owners, Kroenke, Sports & Entertainment, are fully committed to supporting Arsenal through this challenging time. ""We are also carefully controlling our costs. We have stopped most capital spend, and our discretionary operating expenditure is being strictly controlled. Earlier this month, our executive team volunteered to waive more than a third of their earnings over the next 12 months. ""We are hugely grateful for the support of our people. Their togetherness and resolve know no bounds, even though very many of them face the challenge of having no work to do while the season is suspended.  ""We are fortunate to be able to count on their commitment and co-operation at this time. ""We are in ongoing contact with our employees through video conferences, newsletters and team meetings. ""We have made it clear to them that we are not considering redundancies, and we are fully focussed on protecting their well-being, jobs and salaries. ""All our employees are receiving their full salaries and we plan to continue this. We are not currently intending to use the Governmentâ€™s furlough scheme. ""In addition to our employees, we are extending our commitment to pay casual workers on our payroll from the end of April to the end of May. ""For our matchday casual workers this means they will be paid for all four Premier League games that have been postponed and will be paid again should they work at these games once re-arranged.""

25,"Bill Gates funded the PIRBRIGHT institute, which owns the patent on coronavirus",Ethan Huff,"Believe it or not, the coronavirus strain that’s currently spreading throughout China and abroad is a patented virus that’s owned by an entity called The Pirbright Institute, which is partially funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The patent page for coronavirus explains that it “may be used as a vaccine for treating and/or preventing a disease, such as infectious bronchitis, in a subject,” suggesting that this is just another weaponized viral strain designed to sell more useless, deadly vaccines, while at the same time killing off a few thousand, or perhaps a few million, people. A close look at the patent page also shows that the Pirbright Institute owns all sorts of other virus patents, including one for African swine fever virus, which is listed as a “vaccine.” It is thus no surprise that Bill Gates is a Pirbright Institute fiAnonymouscial backer, seeing as how he’s one of the most aggressive, vaccine-pushing “philanthropists” on the planet. The way this whole coronavirus situation is taking shape would seem to be exactly what Gates once proposed as a “solution” to the alleged problem of “overpopulation.” At an infamous TED Talk, Gates explained that vaccines are one of the keys to reducing global population levels, and what better way to do that than to unleash patented coronavirus on the masses in order to later introduce a patented vaccine for it?",1,
379,Enough of this epic delusion: coronavirus makes sport in front of fans a long way off | Sport | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/seaningle,"We still donâ€™t get it. Even now, as death tolls rise exponentially across Europe and the greatest economic crisis of our age deepens, the white lies persist. That the football season could be completed by midâ€‘July. That the Olympics could take place a week or two after. That a bumper summer of sport will give the nation the mother of all pickâ€‘meâ€‘ups. It is an epic delusion. And, frankly, we have had enough of them already. Over the weekend I spoke to a leading expert, who is involved with the national response to the coronavirus pandemic, to ask him when sport as we know it â€“ in front of packed crowds â€“ might return. His response was sober and downbeat. â€œMy expectation is that this is something that is going to be around for a long period of time,â€ he said. â€œThere are no silver bullets on the horizon. We are talking months and months â€“ and perhaps even next year and beyond.â€ Only charlatans, hucksters and superforecasters confidently claim to predict the future. But if we listen closely to the scientists and medical professionals we can anticipate what is coming next. Things will get worse. Many more people will lose their lives. The NHS will be put under enormous strain. And even after the peak â€“ whenever that is â€“ it will take time for social distancing measures to be relaxed and for the coronavirus to be behind us. The scientific expert I spoke to, on condition of anonymity, suggested that a best-case scenario was that an antibody test will be soon developed that will let us know if substantial numbers of the population have been infected and recovered. But, he stressed, it would probably still take six months for it to be developed, ramped up, and tested on the population. Meanwhile a vaccine might not be ready for 18 months, given it will have to go through the necessary safety trials. â€œWe still have very little understanding of how prevalent Covid-19 is in the population,â€ he said. â€œAnd it may be that when we do have those tests, weâ€™ll find out that, actually, there are huge numbers of people who have been exposed and have been asymptomatic and they are immune. That could be a game changer. But we just donâ€™t know at this point. And it would be very reckless to assume that everything is going to go right after that.â€ Even if football returns behind closed doors â€“ the bestâ€‘case scenario â€“ there are obvious issues. If a single player tests positive for the virus then their whole squad will have to self-isolate for a fortnight, elongating the season further. And having ambulances at matches will be seen as hugely irresponsible if the NHS is still under severe strain. As the scientist put it: â€œWe are in a very bad place. And we havenâ€™t even spoken about the impact on the economy. Potentially youâ€™ve got people not being able to afford to go to football matches.â€ Indeed as the crisis grows I wonder if our top clubs will start feeling a responsibility to help those lower down the food chain. If the Premier League clubs can fork out Â£250,000 each for Richard Scudamoreâ€™s Â£5m golden goodbye then surely they can find a pot of money to help lower league clubs. More top players should also thinking about giving back. Every fan feels that they have a symbiotic relationship with their club; and without supporters paying for Sky Sports subscriptions and season tickets playersâ€™ salaries would be nowhere near as astronomical. Maybe before posting videos on social media from their lavishly decorated houses more players could put their hands in their pockets? Itâ€™s not as if they canâ€™t afford it. According to the recent Global Salary Survey, the average basic pay for a Premier League first-team squad member is Â£61,024 a week â€“ and that is before appearance fees, bonuses and any benefits. Thatâ€™s a cumulative Â£30m a week in basic wages for the Premier League teamsâ€™ 25-man squads. Imagine the difference if every player offered to give up one weekâ€™s pay to charity? True, over the weekend Manchester United and Manchester City players donated a combined Â£100,000 to help food banks. That news was welcome, but it was still a drop in the ocean. At least on Sunday the International Olympic Committee acknowledged for the first time that the Tokyo Games could be delayed. The IOC has set itself a four-week deadline to decide. But given the widespread restrictions on public gatherings and closed training facilities are making it impossible for many athletes to prepare, Tokyo 2020 will surely morph into Tokyo 2021. Even if the virus has subsided in Japan come the summer, it will almost certainly linger in other countries. Would it really be wise to allow 10,000 athletes and close to a million spectators to fly in from across the globe? The expert repeatedly emphasised how uncertain the future looks. There could be a second or third wave of the virus. It could mutate into something worse. However, when I asked him whether there was any chance that this seasonâ€™s Premier League and Champions League might be finished soon, or the Olympics could take place as planned, he was absolutely clear. â€œI think itâ€™s delusional to think itâ€™s going to happen. If people are saying that theyâ€™ve got absolutely no idea about whatâ€™s about to hit them.â€",0,
371,"Coronavirus could impact 5 million companies worldwide, research shows",Elliot Smith@ElliotSmithCNBC,"The new coronavirus outbreak and subsequent shutdown of huge swathes of China could impact more than 5 million businesses worldwide, according to a new study. A special briefing issued by global data analytics firm Dun & Bradstreet analyzed the Chinese provinces most impacted by the virus, and found they are intricately linked to the global business network. The affected areas with 100 or more confirmed cases as of February 5 are home to more than 90% of all active businesses in China, according to the report, and around 49,000 businesses in these regions are branches and subsidiaries of foreign companies. Almost half (49%) of the companies with subsidiaries in impacted regions are headquartered in Hong Kong, while the U.S. accounts for 19%, Japan 12% and Germany 5%. As of Monday, over 70,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed in China, resulting in 1,770 deaths, according to the Chinese National Health Commission. Dun & Bradstreet researchers found that at least 51,000 companies worldwide, 163 of which are in the Fortune 1000, have one or more direct or ""tier 1"" suppliers in the impacted region, while at least 5 million â€” and 938 in the Fortune 1000 â€” have one or more ""tier 2"" suppliers. The impact on businesses in China and around the world is already dragging down economic growth forecasts for the year. In a research note published Monday, Moody's revised down its global growth forecasts by two-tenths of a percentage point, expecting G-20 economies to collectively grow at an annual rate of 2.4% in 2020 with China slipping to 5.2%. This assumes a baseline forecast that the spread of the virus is contained by the end of the first quarter, restoring ""normal economic activity"" in the second quarter. However, the global economic toll would be ""severe"" if the rate of infection and rising death toll do not abate, with international supply chain disruptions amplifying the shock. ""There is already evidence albeit anecdotal - that supply chains are being disrupted, including outside China. Furthermore, extended lockdowns in China would have a global impact given the country's importance and interconnectedness in the global economy,"" Moody's Vice President Madhavi Bokil said in the research note. The Dun & Bradstreet report identified that the top five major sectors, accounting for more than 80% of businesses within impacted provinces, were services, wholesale trade, manufacturing, retail and financial services. Dun & Bradstreet hypothesized that a major portion of Chinese employment and sales originate from companies within the impacted region. The impacted provinces of, for instance, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing and Shandong account for 50% of total employment and 48% of total sales volume for the Chinese economy. The Chinese economy constitutes around 20% of global GDP (gross domestic product) and analysts estimated that if containment of the outbreak is delayed beyond the summer, the ""cascading effect"" might cause a drag of around one percentage point on global GDP growth. ""No matter which scenario plays out, the Hubei region, China, and the global economy are indicated to see a churn in their business population and some lackluster employment and revenue growth in the near-term,"" the company said in the report. ""When (not if) containment and eradication is achieved, factors within the impacted geography are bound to generate economic activity with consumers, satisfying pent-up demand once improved conditions are underway. The sum of the efforts to revitalize the region will place the global economy back on track for sustained growth.""",0,
168,THE SAKER: “THERE IS A TICKING TIME BOMB IN THE UKRAINE”,Anonymous,"Six, COVID19 has hit the Ukraine very, very hard.  The problem is that the authorities, which fully knew that they had no means to do anything meaningful began by thumping their chests and saying that there were no cases in the Ukraine only to then suddenly decree drastic quarantine measures.  And yet, the true information is seeping out: Ukrainians hospitals are full of cases, mostly un-diagnosed, and many have already died.  Officially, and as of right now, there are only 14 confirmed cases in the Ukraine, and only two fatalities.  But absolutely everybody knows that these numbers are totally fictional and that the real number of cases remains unknown due to a lack of testing kits, not a lack of cases.  MDs in Ukrainian hospitals are sounding the alarms, but nobody is listening.",1,
209,Is 5G a Deadly Trigger for the Coronavirus?,James Grundvig,"The uneven spread of the novel coronavirus around the world was clustered in several hot pockets while leaving other areas with scant outbreaks. This pattern developed in China, with the epicenter of Wuhan City in Hubei province owning, at one time, more than 99% of the cases and deaths over the rest of the country of 1.4 billion people.

Outside the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong have not experienced the runaway infections or deaths that China did, with the latter twice experiencing the restart of last year’s protests. Although the coronavirus spread fast in South Korea and Japan in the beginning, both outbreaks were extinguished.

In South Korea, the vectors for two of the country’s four clusters came from a Wuhan branch of a cult church and a Catholic church pilgrimage returning from Israel. Since then, South Korea has moved aggressively to defuse new clusters by radically testing people and disinfecting mass transit systems daily. With more than 9,100 cases and 126 deaths, and with one-third recovered, Korea has fewer cases and deaths than New York City. Today, South Korea also boasts the fewest number of new coronavirus cases, according to the BBC.

Japan took a different route with the novel virus. Japan has only 1,200 cases and 130 deaths. A total of 712 infections came from one supercluster in the Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Yokohama. That’s more than half of the entire country.

The International Olympic Committee recently canceled the Tokyo Summer Olympics. The cancellation isn’t due to the outbreak in Japan, but likely from so many nations battling the virus.

The New Epicenter of Northern Italy
In March, the COVID-19 outbreak shifted from China to Northern Italy. Soon after, the entire nation of 60 million was placed under strict quarantine. Social distancing turned into permission slips to leave one’s home. Despite the containment efforts, the virus hit Italy very hard. It emptied streets, stopped life as Italians knew it while killing more than 7,500 people out of 75,000 total infected.

On the first weekend of spring, images emerged from Italy, showing similar scenes of horror. Scenes that were eerily reminiscent of Wuhan: people walking down the street, collapsing dead without any external force. Dozens of such videos and photos showed the fallen people spread eagle, flat on their backs, face down on sidewalks. Lifeless. No blood splatter. Outside of one similar case in New York City, no other place in the world has produced such anomalies.

Why?

What causes people, who appear to be fit, to keel over without a seizure or to tremble suddenly? What is the underlying cause? And what makes Wuhan and Northern Italy different than other parts of the world? So different that COVID-19 kills people with no apparent explanation?

Why Wuhan?
In 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology selected Wuhan as a pilot city for the “Made in China 2025” plan. The overarching goal aimed at the industrial city of 11 million to become the world’s Internet of Things mecca. The goal? A 5G smart city that would connect homes, offices, hospitals, factories, and autonomous vehicles via a digital fabric.

Renowned for its factories and severe pollution, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) envisioned elevating Wuhan as the global smart city of the future. All of the commands, controls, data sharing, and data flowing through artificial intelligence systems would showcase China as the preeminent digital leader of the world.

At the center of the plan, the Chinese telecom syndicate of ZTE, Huawei, Hubei Mobile, and China Unicom began to transform Wuhan into a giant 5G “hot spot” for wireless technology. The 5G launch in the Hubei capital city culminated with the October 2019 Military World Games. Wuhan activated 20% of its 10,000 5G base stations, and the rest by the end of the year. With the hottest 5G pilot city on the planet, the CCP planned to leverage the publicity to attract more foreign investment and lure international businesses to prop up China’s flagging economy.

Then disaster struck.

A New Pneumonia
In mid-December, just six weeks after the military games concluded, the first cases of a new pneumonia started to show up in area hospitals. Over 72 hours through New Year’s day, scientists decoded the novel virus. On January 2, Wuhan notified the CCP and the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) about the outbreak. The two governing bodies of the Peoples Republic of China took precautions for their leaders, personnel, and buildings. Instead of telling the world about the outbreak, the regime kept it under tight control. Three weeks after sequencing the virus, Xi Jinping finally made his first public comment about the discovery of COVID-19 and the epidemic ravaging Wuhan.

By then, the epidemic erupted out of control. Millions became infected, and tens of thousands in Hubei died. These numbers far exceeded the “official” numbers claimed by the CCP and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).

At its height, many leaked videos showed people falling, collapsing, or sprawled dead in the streets of Wuhan. Nowhere else in the infected areas of China did similar scenes show that type of death.

Then a clinical study comparing “Imported cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province,” by Jian Wu, et al., discovered a key finding between Wuhan and Jiangsu patients.

“Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan.”

So, what was the underlying cofactor that separated Wuhan from all other areas in China? And what was the factor that was making the virus more virulent?

Body Bags
While the WHO praised China’s response to the outbreak, only in Wuhan did the police weld infected people in their apartments to die. Only in Wuhan did they burn bodies beyond the capacity of the crematoriums. Only in Wuhan did the regime receive accusations of burying the dead in body bags under cover of the night.

In looking for a cofactor, several outlets suggest Wuhan’s acute pollution was to blame for the virus’ death toll. Others theorized that a vaccine trial “primed” a subset of citizens, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. In the former, there are many other cities in Asia as polluted that didn’t experience the same corona clusters. While in the latter, no new vaccine trials were launched in Wuhan in 2019.

5G Microwave Effects at 60GHz
In 2001, Shigeaki Hakusui, then president of Harmonix Corporation, explained why fifth-generation wireless technology was needed to reach the goal of creating smart cities. He said it would require bandwidth and efficiency to meet the data demand as the Internet moved toward mobile technology. That was two decades ago.

Hakusui noted that 60GHz was the true radiofrequency that would allow for reliable transmission of data, due to its “98 percent oxygen absorption” rate. This allows the invisible signals to travel from point A and B, and back again on the same path. Super-efficient and a technological milestone.

Hakusui writes:

Since the presence of O2 is fairly consistent at ground level, its effect on 60GHz radio propagation is easily modeled for margin budgeting purposes. Also, the high level of attenuation from oxygen absorption makes even the worst weather-related attenuation insignificant, especially on the short paths where 60GHz systems operate.

He stated, unequivocally, that 60GHz would deliver the last mile efficiently, as the “oxygen absorption makes possible the same-frequency reuse within a very localized region of air space.”

The downside to 5G, however, is the lack of biological safety and health tests to support its global rollout. Even workers who installed 5G towers are burning them down. Does the electrification of the entire planet make sense? Do thousands of satellites being deployed where infrastructure doesn’t exist, such as the oceans make sense?

Unsettling Results
Testing 5G by trial and error has already produced some unsettling results. They include the mass deaths of birds in the Netherlands, the cutting down of half of Sheffield, England’s trees, and strange illness clusters of children in some U.S. schools.
Most people don’t grasp or care that their WiFi can send signals through drywall, glass, and concrete slabs, just the same as beams go through the human body. And with 5G a far more focused beam, those signals have no trouble traveling through a person.

The problem is for every breath we breathe, our blood transports oxygen throughout the core, extremities, to the vital organs, heart, and brain.

If 5G at 60 GHz frequency zips through the air, absorbing most of the oxygen, disrupting the electrons that bind 02 molecules that, combined with a hydrogen atom, form water vapor, what is that frequency doing to blood cells, which consist primarily of water and carry the oxygen?

Do the disruption of the body’s biorhythm, breathing, and oxygen distribution begin to explain what happens to the people who dropped dead?

Mt. Everest “Death Zone”
Studies of acute mountain sickness show that as climbers ascend in altitude, they hit an endurance wall from a lack of oxygen. “At 4500 m [14,764 feet], the real amount of oxygen in the air composition is only 12% diluted, which is approximately 60% of sea-level oxygen,” according to Brazilian scientists, who published a paper last year.

Higher up the mountain in the “death zone” of Mt. Everest, climbers die due to severe hyperbaric hypoxia, even with bottled oxygen as their blood coagulates. In another view, altitude sickness starves the brain of oxygen.

That does stack up and explains the unusual scenes of Wuhan citizens dying literally in the streets. They keel over dead, not shaking from a heart attack or seizure, never resuscitated.

Milan in Northern Italy is the 5G capital of Europe. Iran, where suspected millions have been infected, has installed 5G deployments. And sure enough, the three Princess line cruise ships—Diamond, Grand, and now Ruby—had GEO and MEO satellites beaming 5G down to the ships as they travel via a Medallion Net receiver system last autumn.

Although South Korea is a wirelessly connected nation, it doesn’t have the number of cases like other places in the world that does. Yet, its third and fourth coronavirus clusters were in 5G-hot gymnasium and hospital.

As the anomalous deaths of people in Wuhan and Italy can attest, society, the telecom industry, and government are long past due to study the health effects of 5G, especially at the “unlicensed” 60GHz frequency.",1,
264,"Coronavirus becoming much less lethal, virus is losing its 'potency,' top doctor reveals",CHRIS ENLOE,"The coronavirus has become much less lethal and the virus is losing its ""potency,"" a top Italian doctor has said, Reuters reported. Dr. Alberto Zangrillo, the head of the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan — one of the areas in Italy hardest hit by COVID-19 — explained the evolution of the virus is extremely positive. ""In reality, the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy,"" Zangrillo told RAI television, Reuters reported. ""The swabs that were performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load in quantitative terms that was absolutely infinitesimal compared to the ones carried out a month or two months ago,"" he explained. Although daily COVID-19 cases continue to rise, daily deaths are steadily decreasing after reaching a peak in mid-April. The increase in positive cases reflects mass testing around the world, not a virus that is rapidly spreading. Italy, specifically, now averages fewer than 100 COVID-19 deaths per day after becoming the global epicenter just two months ago. The decrease in potency means nations should reopen, Zangrillo said. In fact, the doctor said there should be accountability for leaders who enacted such harsh lockdowns when the virus never lived up to the scientific predictions. ""We've got to get back to being a normal country,"" he said, Reuters reported. ""Someone has to take responsibility for terrorizing the country."" Dr. Matteo Bassetti, the head of the infectious diseases clinic at a hospital in Genoa, corroborated Zangrillo's analysis. ""The strength the virus had two months ago is not the same strength it has today,"" he told the ANSA news agency, Reuters reported. ""It is clear that today the COVID-19 disease is different.""",1,
18,Irrefutable: The coronavirus was engineered by scientists in a lab using well documented genetic engineering vectors that leave behind a “fingerprint”,Mike Adams,"Every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists. The proof is in the virus itself: The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remAnonymousts in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab. But the WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China and its biological weapons program, since no government wants the public to know the full truth about how frequently government-run labs experience outbreaks. Decades ago, for example, the U.S. Army ran an Ebola bioweapons lab in the United States, where a monkey infected one of the scientists there. The strain turned out to be infectious only in monkeys, not humans, so the world dodged a bullet, but the U.S. Army “nuked” the entire facility with chemical bombs, killing all the monkeys and wiping out any last remAnonymoust of the virus on U.S. soil. You can read the full details of that incident in the book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. We’ve also covered it at NaturalNews.com, where this book description is reprinted: In 1989, Reston, VA — one of the most famous U.S. planned communities located about 10 miles from Washington DC — stood at the epicenter of a potential biological disaster. This well-known story was narrated by Richard Preston in a bone chilling account related to the recognition and containment of a devastating tropical filovirus at a monkey facility — the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit. That outbreak occurred because Ebola was found to be spreading through the air ducts, confirming that Ebola can spread through the air. This simple fact was vigorously covered up by the entire medical establishment during the Ebola scare in the United States many years later, where the CDC transported an infected patient to a hospital in Dallas, subsequently infecting a nurse who was treated with highly toxic chemicals that caused permanent kidney damage (she later sued the hospital for the damage she suffered). The reason this is relevant is because in order to understand the coronavirus situation in China, we must first realize that virology research labs routinely experience lapses in containment. Even the United States has failed to contain deadly viral strains when trying to study them. China’s BSL-4 labs have experienced multiple accidental releases of SARS strains, and this new coronavirus is now confirmed to be an engineered strain that was either used in bioweapons research or vaccine experiments.The genomic coding in the virus is not natural, in other words. Just as you would never encounter a snake in the desert that’s writing a book containing words and grammatical structure, the genetic sequences now identified in the coronavirus strain are, without question, proof that human engineers have been tinkering with the strain. How to genetically engineer viruses: the pShuttle vector. One of the tools used to accomplish this genetic engineering is called pShuttle. It’s a genetic tool set that can carry a payload of genes to be inserted into the target virus. Researchers engaged in genetic engineering can purchase the pShuttle sequence from online retailers such as AddGenes.org, which sells the sequence for $75, shipped in “bacteria as agar stab.”The method for using pShuttle is described in a PubMed document entitled, “A simplified system for generating recombiAnonymoust adenoviruses.” The summary of the paper describes, “a strategy that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses.” Here’s how the process works to achieve genetic engineering of viruses: A recombiAnonymoust adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, using homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfections of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of green fluorescent protein, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification. The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link. The pShuttle vector was used to insert SARS genes into the coronavirus, a process that makes it deadly to humans. “The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials,” warns Lyons-Weiler: The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered. He also warns about, “studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.” He concludes: If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.",1,
257,Is the Coronavirus weaponized to use against Trump?,Deplorable Patriot,"Ask yourself the following questions, Question set A(Answer yes or no) “Has the media ever lied to you?” “Would the media over sensationalize anything to fulfill their personal aspirations.?” ” Would the media weaponize the media and use it against Trump?”  “If so, have they done it in the past?”  “If so, and they were caught doing it, would they do it again?” *Media meaning “Main Stream Media, proven untrustworthy, CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, etc….whatever, Fake news,  HIJ, QRS…you get my point.” Question set B(Answer yes or no) ” You catch someone on camera stealing from you.  They lie to you when you ask them about it.  Would you trust that person?”  “If given the opportunity, do think they will steal from you again?” “Would they lie to you again?” “Would you ever believe anything that person said about anything?”  “Because this person lies to you and cannot be trusted, would you continue to have that person in your life?” Most of the people I know would end up with the same answer for each of the questions. The question “Because this person lies to you and cannot be trusted, would you continue to have that person in your life?” should be an easy no.  Most people don’t like to have people in their life that flat out lie and steal from them.  Keep in mind that I use the word “trust” loosely.  Obviously there are many different levels of trust for different people, situations, etc. The point I’m trying to make is the media are nothing more than people.  People that lie as much,  if not more than that lying untrustworthy person you no longer want in your life.  There is no sane reason why any person should believe anything the media says or does.  Here’s the problem.  I’m not insane. You’re not insane.  So why do we watch it?  “Sometimes they lie, sometimes they don’t”. Nope, they’re always lying.  It has to be for “entertainment”. That “entertainment” is destroying our country and it’s latest exploit seems to be the Coronavirus. My research tells me that the Coironavirus is another bio weapon.  It also tells me that all is not what it seems.  Since I cannot provide my sources, consider that to be just  my opinion. There are other “opinions” that are pretty much in alignment with what I have learned.  I believe there are some key points that should be reviewed.  The following was mentioned in the comments the other day. William- “It is important to realize how infectious epidemics are created in the public mind by TPTB for their skeer value, as vectors of social control. The so-called coronavirus epidemic is the latest, following SARS, Zika, Bird flu, West Nile, etc., all of which were just background noise. And of course HIV/AIDS. My sense is that they have been experiments but sooner or later we’ll get the Big One and then we’ll have mandatory vaccines, quarantine internment camps, suspension of constitutional liberties. C-virus makes me uneasy, they are hyping it and it doesn’t seem to have characteristics of an infectious epidemic. They reported a huge spike in cases but this was due to diagnosing it on the basis of pneumonia with no lab tests for the “virus”, neglecting to mention that pneumonia is very common in China, accounting for 300 thousand deaths a year. Probably due to the appallingly bad air quality. So we see pictures of people wearing masks but they wear masks anyway. They did the same with AIDS ’93, changing the definition to include people with fewer than 200 T4 lymphocytes per mililiter (or microliter, I forget which) of blood in the presence of HIV. “Presence” being determined by antibody reactions to certain proteins, no “HIV” necessary. So the “HIV test” was a machine that went “ping”. This re-defintion arbitrarily doubled the number of AIDS cases overnight and by 1997 two-thirds of people diagnosed with AIDS weren’t even sick, the first time in history that a 100 percent fatal disease was diagnosed on the basis of “good health”. So they stopped publishing the figures, the little people don’t need to see this stuff anyway, they just get confused. And now Trump, in the SOTU, says we have to end the AIDS epidemic. But there is no AIDS epidemic and there never was. And now coronavirus. So yeah, I’m uneasy” Myself- “Yes, I understand what you are saying. I think there is a good possibility that when things cool down with the corona virus there will be a push to try to pass mandatory vaccinations. Using the coronavirus, influenza to scare people into supporting the vaccinations. The highest estimate of influenza cases in the USA is 45 million illnesses That dates from 2010 to present. Highest estimate of deaths related to influenza would be close to 61,000.. They don’t tell people that a lot of those deaths are from other causes and not the influenza itself. Still, the amount of deaths is low considering the amount of people infected. So I’m thinking “scare tactic” to push an agenda. Makes me think about “Fun Vax”. Thanks for the enlightenment on the whole HIV thing. Admittedly, HIV is not a topic I spend too much time on. I did take a class on it. But that was years ago when I saw things different than I do now.” William- “Flu kills tens of thousands annually in this country, usually the very old, very young, and people with compromised immune function. And malaria kills a million people a year, year after year. So far the C-virus has killed 1500 people, or so we’re told. I don’t believe anything that comes out of China and I believe even less of what the MSM talking heads are spouting. But 1500 people is nothing, a statistical blip. TPTB use managed chaos as their MO and releasing a deadly pathogen into populations would be unpredictable and unmanageable. It’s far more effective for them to create a virtual epidemic/emergency as they did with HIV/AIDS. It’s utterly irrelevant as a public health issue, if they cut off funding for it it would disappear. Or “climate change”, they have taken normal stable climate and turned it into a crisis. At least in the minds of many many people. There’s a lot of stoopid in this land of ours. But all the infrastructure is ready, the quarantine camps ( I understand there is one in WA State that is being used to sequester Americans who have returned from China), the executive orders issued by GWB and Hussein that give absolute authority to the CDC, as well as the Model Emergency Health Powers Act (MEHPA) that is totalitarian in nature. So I hope things die down with corona. Most Americans aren’t really interested so it may be a dry run. I’m trying to convince myself of that anyway, so I can let go of it. Until the next one”",1,
156,COVID and the Terror of Uncertainty,Gordon Duff,"There are two worlds, in a way never before imagined, one of people and jobs, of life and experience, the other a shadowy world of deceit and terrorism.

As the month of March 2020 comes to an end and April begins, the entire planet is being tested. As expected, as promised as any idiot might guess, political leadership has failed and the organizations intended to coordinate the planetary response to biological threats has shown itself to be politicized, weakened or possibly worse.

On March 30, 2020, the Berman Law Group of Boca Raton, Florida, filed a $20 trillion lawsuit against the government of China for creating and disseminating the COVID 19 virus which has, well, we don’t really know.

One has to remind one’s self of our times. A few years ago, what was termed an “Arab Spring” emerged, largely manipulated by militarized subsidiaries of Google and Facebook, funded by totalitarian regimes aligned with the US.

“Spring,” as it turned out means something different to the people of the Middle East. The social reformers of the West delivered head choppers and Islamists, stolen oil and looted factories and not so much democracy as promised.

Then, as so easily predicted, those who brought the disease thus offered the cure, “coalition” bombings, occupation, drone assassination and unending suffering.

In Ukraine, “spring” meant false flag snipers and downing an airliner followed by a descent into politics more familiar to those who studied the last century and the fascist attempt to rule the world.

Nothing is as it seems, nothing seen can be believed, nothing read is true, nothing taught exists, all is flimflammery and bluster, buffoonery and mayhem.

Well, what does one see? Living in the United States, one sees a lockdown of a nation for one, two, three or more months. What one doesn’t see is where, exactly 200 million people are, how they live, where the money comes from to feed them and what the sinking feeling of hopelessness is doing to them.

For the “haves,” well fiAnonymousced retirees or medical workers not yet infected, life may be changed, even grim but it will continue.

Quite recently, a number of publications began spreading the rumor that 21 million Chinese mobile phone users had simply disappeared, meaning that they had died of COVID 19 and were now in mass graves.

This type of story is common and such things spring up almost daily. The reason isn’t simple, a sea of absurd lies is manufactured by “think tanks” in order to drown those gems of embarrassing truth that escaped the Google censors or the control of the corporate media.

Here in the US, the concern is generated by driving past miles of closed factories, stores and restaurants. The government plans to send out small checks to cover up to 5% of economic losses of the working poor who were always no more than 3 weeks from homelessness.

Now they can’t be thrown out on the street, not for awhile anyway, law has prevented this but the lost income will never be replaced, income that paid insurance, health care for children, bought food and clothing and that American lifestyle of fast food, cable television and continual texting.

Those jobs, the restaurants and shops, many of the factories, no longer exist. No bail out can save them in a permanently retracted economy that will never be able to reabsorb millions of workers whose livelihood was governed by economic fakery.

Where two weeks before stores were emptied, now the money that fiAnonymousced buying carloads of toilet paper has dwindled away.

No one talks of this. No one reports this. No one asks where 200 million Americans are, how they feed their kids, how they spend their days, and how fear is playing on their vulnerability.

There is no social welfare state in America. The benefits for retirees, Medicare and Social Security, are being chipped away by “conservative” politics.

Health care for veterans, and there are many millions of former military whose lives were destroyed while America destroyed the Middle East, has disappeared, unspoken of and unreported.

Veterans are being told they are being removed from health care and can no longer be treated, including and especially the totally disabled combat veterans. Supplies don’t exist, the pharmacies are out of medications and it didn’t start with COVID 19, it began with Donald Trump. Veterans’ health care, the largest health care system in the world, disappeared when no one was looking. It is dead and gone.

It will never be reported, no organization will complain to congress because, you see, if you aren’t a bank or oil company, one of those with their hands out for $6 trillion in free money from the Trump regime, you don’t exist.

A few paragraphs ago we mentioned the massive lawsuit against China. The assumption that China created COVID 19 is based on an important research paper written in 2015 that tied a research facility in Wuhan to a study on a bat virus that created something capable of infecting the world, a disease exactly like COVID 19.

This is the origin of the “blame China” ploy, just like the blame Russia for fake gas attacks in Syria or when the Kiev regime shot down MH17.

All that was needed was a fake court, fake evidence and controlled media.

With the accusation against China, all that is needed is for China to be tied, in this case for supplying a virus, to a dangerous terror group, to a global pandemic.

The terror group, as we discovered was the USAID, a CIA affiliate that used the Wuhan virus to create something frightening at the University of North Carolina, not in Wuhan.

A lawsuit and trial will condemn China in a rigged American court. Experts, so many experts, who saw China defeat the disease in weeks while it has run rampant across the US, have come to believe that the US was always the origin and that COVID 19 had been around for some time inside the US before showing up in China.

What is strange is that some questions are never asked. Why so many die in Northern Italy? The best hospitals in the world are there, no transportation hubs, no ties to “Wuhan” and no bio-warfare labs? Are they being experimented on?

Then we have Detroit, another anomaly. A city of all private homes, a city filled with poor, a disease spread rapidly through a community that uses no public transportation and that has been housebound by weather for months.

No one looks for a “patient zero” or “super-spreader,” a term used in studies on bio-terrorism.

The other untold story is the restructuring of America’s employment environment, no trade unions anymore, no contracts, no benefits, no guarantees, the war on the worker that Reagan began and Bush (43) won behind the smokescreen of 9/11 and the fake War on Terror.

You see, injured workers seldom qualify for benefits and those laid off because of economic slowdowns are denied benefits though processes of fake accusations and legal trickery.

It gets worse, if you are injured on a job, let’s say a piece of heavy equipment breaks and you are seriously injured. Not only will you likely never receive wage compensation, but you are likely to be denied needed medical care as well. Medical treatment is often withheld, other than enough to make sure you don’t die right away, until a “hearings process” is exhausted, which can take up to two years. During that time, a physical injury will often lead to permanent crippling and care, when it becomes available eventually, is palliative only, often opiate pain relievers.

This is what is meant when it is said that the social welfare “SafetyNet” in the US has disappeared.

This is where 200 million Americans without hope now live, to fend for themselves and watch television, being told day and night to hate China and wait for a check with Donald Trump’s signature that might buy tires for a car that was repossessed.",1,
240,Chinese Coronavirus Is a Man Made Virus According to Luc Montagnier the Man Who Discovered HIV,Robert Miller,"Contrary to the narrative that is being pushed by the mainstream that the COVID 19 virus was the result of a natural mutation and that it was transmitted to humans from bats via pangolins, Dr Luc Montagnier the man who discovered the HIV virus back in 1983 disagrees and is saying that the virus was man made. Professor Luc Montagnier, 2008 Nobel Prize winner for Medicine, claims that SARS-CoV-2 is a manipulated virus that was accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Chinese researchers are said to have used coronaviruses in their work to develop an AIDS vaccine. HIV RNA fragments are believed to have been found in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We knew that the Chinese version of how the coronavirus emerged was increasingly under attack, but here’s a thesis that tells a completely different story about the Covid-19 pandemic, which is already responsible for more than 110,000 deaths worldwide. According to Professor Luc Montagnier, winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for “discovering” HIV as the cause of the AIDS epidemic together with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, the SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that was manipulated and accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, in the last quarter of 2019. According to Professor Montagnier, this laboratory, known for its work on coronaviruses, tried to use one of these viruses as a vector for HIV in the search for an AIDS vaccine! The truth will eventually come out
In any case, this thesis, defended by Professor Luc Montagnier, has a positive turn. According to him, the altered elements of this virus are eliminated as it spreads: “Nature does not accept any molecular tinkering, it will eliminate these unnatural changes and even if nothing is done, things will get better, but unfortunately after many deaths.” Luc Montagnier added that with the help of interfering waves, we could eliminate these sequences and as a result stop the pandemic. This is enough to feed some heated debates! So much so that Professor Montagnier’s statements could also place him in the category of “conspiracy theorists”: “Conspirators are the opposite camp, hiding the truth,” he replies, without wanting to accuse anyone, but hoping that the Chinese will admit to what he believes happened in their laboratory.
To entice a confession from the Chinese he used the example of Iran which after taking full responsibility for accidentally hitting a Ukrainian plane was able to earn the respect of the global community. Hopefully the Chinese will do the right thing he ads. “In any case, the truth always comes out, it is up to the Chinese government to take responsibility.”",1,
364,Singapore's cramped migrant worker dorms hide Covid-19 surge risk | World news | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe,"Singapore, praised for its gold standard approach to tracing coronavirus cases, is facing a surge in transmission linked to its cramped migrant workersâ€™ dormitories, where thousands more infections are expected to emerge. The health ministry reported 728 new cases on Thursday, the biggest rise in a single day, as medical teams raced to test and isolate workers living in vast dormitory blocks. While Singapore has been lauded for its rapid and comprehensive approach to contract tracing, officials have been accused of overlooking the dormitories, where thousands of workers live in close quarters and between 12 and 20 men might share a single room. In March the campaign group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) urged officials to make plans to protect workers, warning: â€œThe risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable.â€ Authorities are resorting to moving men to multi-storey car parks, military camps and floating hotels in an attempt to reduce crowding. Mohan Dutta, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand, who has interviewed 45 migrant workers in Singapore since the outbreak began, said many feared an outbreak was inevitable due to the conditions. â€œParticipants told me that even up until Monday they donâ€™t have access to soap and adequate cleaning supplies,â€ he said. While migrants were being served food so that they did not use shared kitchens, the quality of meals was poor and lacking in nutrition. In some cases 100 men were sharing five toilets and five showers. Nine dormitories, the biggest of which holds 24,000 men, have been declared isolation units by officials, while all other buildings accommodating the city-stateâ€™s 300,000 workers have been placed under effective lockdown. The restrictions, an attempt to reduce further transmission, have left the dormitories even more crowded than usual as only essential workers are permitted to leave. One construction worker, from Bangladesh, told the Guardian there were long queues to use shared bathrooms which often did not have enough water for the showers or toilets to function. No one in his dormitory had yet tested positive, he said, but some people had temperatures of 38C. â€œIn my room and other rooms also there are many [with] symptoms, some feel [they have] no energy, someone has body aches,â€ he said. â€œWe are frightened.â€ The government said it had increased cleaning services in the dormitories, which are usually privately operated, and was providing meals to workers and moving people to alternative accommodation. Professor Dale Fisher, a senior consultant in infectious diseases at Singaporeâ€™s National University Hospital, said medical teams had moved from hospitals to test people on site quickly. â€œIf we donâ€™t stop it there the hospitals will get overwhelmed.â€ It was likely that thousands more cases would be discovered, Fisher said. â€œ[The men] are all 30 to 40 years old, which is good, but still when youâ€™re dealing with these massive numbers youâ€™re going to get a good number of sick 30 to 40-year-olds. â€œThe risk [relating to migrant worker dormitories] is completely different and the preparation and the anticipation wasnâ€™t there. â€œThe message to other places is, if you have an overcrowded setting it is just so vulnerable,â€ Fisher said, pointing to slum areas in countries such as India. â€œWhen people say Indiaâ€™s shutdown has been extended â€“ I canâ€™t think of anything other than shutting down. Itâ€™s like the only defence youâ€™ve got.â€ The second wave of cases in Singapore has brought the total number of infections to 4,427 including 10 deaths. Fisher said he was not aware of any fatalities among migrant worker clusters but these typically were not recorded until a later date. Singaporeâ€™s migrant workers, who are largely from India and Bangladesh, are an essential part of the work force. Many toil for long hours on the countryâ€™s construction sites, building its skyscrapers and shopping malls, so that they can send money to relatives back home. It is not uncommon for workers, who have temporary contracts and are dependent upon their employers for work permits, to be paid less than promised. Many earn around S$1,200 per month, according to Dutta. The workers pay large sums in agency fees to work in Singapore and are often reluctant to complain for fear of being deported. Workersâ€™ dormitories are on the outskirts of the city-state, which, Dutta said, â€œmakes them in many ways invisible to the landscape of Singaporeâ€.",0,
295,Union seeks legal immunity for NHS medics in pandemic | Society | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/owenbowcott,"The NHS could be faced with billions of pounds of medical negligence claims if it does not grant some form of legal immunity to medics risking their lives during the pandemic, the government has been warned. The Medical Defence Union (MDU), which provides legal support to around 200,000 doctors, nurses, dentists and other healthcare workers, is calling for a debate over the need for emergency legislation. Several US states including New York, New Jersey and Michigan have already adopted laws that provide healthcare professionals and hospitals with â€œimmunity from civil liability for any injury or death alleged to have been sustained because of any acts or omissions undertaken in good faithâ€ during the crisis. In both the US and UK, doctors are being asked to work outside their expertise in areas where they may not have the most up-to-date knowledge, the MDU points out. Retired doctors have been called back to the wards and medical students sent out before they have finished training. Other treatments and surgeries are being delayed to cope with the influx of coronavirus patients. The UK government has promised to cover the cost of any future legal actions by providing indemnities, but the MDU says this could still cost the country vast sums and expose those who have volunteered to â€œextremely distressingâ€ and potentially career-damaging hearings. The cost of medical negligence in the NHS has climbed steeply in recent years. In 2018, NHS Resolution estimated the accumulated claims it was facing amounted to Â£83.4bn. The MDU, which is the largest medical defence organisation in the UK, is concerned that a deluge of medical liability lawsuits could be served on healthcare workers long after the memory of their sacrifices and the circumstances of the pandemic has faded. With medical staff taking difficult decisions about patient care in challenging conditions, the MDU wants them to be able to work without fear they will be unfairly judged in the years to come. It accepts that doctors should be accountable for their actions and it is therefore calling for a public debate over legal immunity and whether the NHS should be able to be sued for patient care related to the Covid-19 outbreak. It says any compensation paid out would be a drain on NHS resources and the taxpayer as well as being damaging to staff morale. Dr Christine Tomkins, the MDUâ€™s chief executive, said: â€œOur practitioners are being asked to work in conditions that are drastically changed. We have not received any claims yet [related to coronavirus] but we aware of some complaints about treatment of patients. â€œThis could be a very great drain on healthcare resources. It would take money from frontline services. We want to have sensible debate about it. Itâ€™s for society to decide whether itâ€™s proper in such wholly exceptional circumstances.â€ She added: â€œDoctors are having to work in very difficult circumstances. These are people who, very bravely, are working to the best of their ability. It should not be underestimated how distressing allegations of clinical negligence are for doctors. â€œ[Medical negligence] claims are already out of control. Awards are based on 1948 legislation which says that all future care will be [paid for as] private [medical care]. If we keep taking money out of the NHS we reduce its resources. Itâ€™s a vicious circle.â€ The Department of Health has said its emergency clinical negligence indemnity will cover healthcare workers. The Coronavirus Act 2020 introduced new indemnity powers. The department declined to comment on the calls for legal immunity.",0,

485,Why coronavirus could â€˜ruin Angela Merkelâ€™s EU legacyâ€™ exposed | World | News | Express.co.uk,Kate Nicholson," Ms Merkel has occasionally been dubbed the de facto leader of the EU, for she has been one of the blocâ€™s keenest advocates throughout her time as Germanyâ€™s Chancellor. As the coronavirus has tightened its grip on Europe over the last few weeks, Germanyâ€™s total number of deaths has managed to stay much lower than its neighbouring nations. The infection rate has even dropped to 0.7, meaning each patient transmits the disease to fewer than one other person and last week, Ms Merkel announced a slight ease of Germanyâ€™s lockdown. However, senior researcher Bjorn Bremer at the Max Planck Institute and associate professor Matthias Matthijs at John Hopkins University suggested â€œthe coronavirus is reducing Merkelâ€™s EU legacy to ashesâ€ back in March. Writing for Foreign Policy, they pointed out: â€œThe sheer scale and speed of the coronavirus outbreak will likely require a Europe-wide fiscal response if the continent hopes to prevent another eurozone financial crisis.â€ The experts suggested this could â€œbe the death knell for the 19-country currency unionâ€, the eurozone. Yet, they believe Ms Merkel has â€œgiven little indication whether she is willing to lead such an effortâ€ to pump money back into the bloc to ensure its survival.   The EUâ€™s lack of unity during this crisis has been heavily criticised â€” so much so that the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered crisis-ridden Italy a â€œheartfelt apologyâ€ for not assisting enough. Yet the political experts pointed out: â€œThe EUâ€™s reticence is consistent with Merkelâ€™s preferred vision for Europe. â€œUnless she quickly realises the errors of her earlier ways, one of the victims of the coronavirus may turn out to be her own carefully cultivated EU legacy.â€ Ms Merkel has insisted on adopting austerity measures throughout her decade as the Chancellor. READ MORE: How Spanish Flu could have also started in China  She passed a constitutional debt brake in Germany in 2009 and has revealed several budget surpluses since 2014. Germanyâ€™s â€œvision for the EUâ€ was to encourage structural reforms and fiscal consolidation, but this has been threatened by the pandemic. The solidarity of the bloc had already been put under pressure by the debt crisis â€” and now the pandemic has massively slowed the economy, many financial experts suggest urgent action is needed. In their joint article, Mr Bremer and Mr Mattijs explained: â€œThe German crisis response this time, as compared with the previous financial crisis, will need to be informed by the fact that monetary policy alone will not be enough.â€ They continued: â€œAfter years of austerity measures encouraged by Merkelâ€™s governments, state capacity across the EU has been weakened, automatic stabilizers undermined and domestic demand dampened.â€ They also claimed that â€œaggressive fiscal stimulus packagesâ€' will be necessary â€” something which nations will struggle with as many European countries are still stuck under government debt.

Mr Bremer and Mr Mattijs concluded: â€œHer legacy may well depend on whether she is able to take on Europeâ€™s leadership mantle once more. She is uniquely positioned to do so. The next few days and weeks will prove crucial. â€œThey will show whether Merkel is up to the taskâ€”and whether she is prepared to admit that her EU crisis management of the previous 10 years has always been fatally flawed.â€ Indeed Ms Merkel herself acknowledged the need for action recently. At a press conference earlier this month, she said: â€œEurope, the EU, is facing its biggest test since its foundation. â€œEveryone is equally affected so it must be in everyoneâ€™s interest. That Europe should emerge strongly from this test.â€ She added that â€œGermany is only doing well if Europe is doing well.â€ However, the full effect of the pandemic upon the EU remains to be seen.

423,European stock index futures jump on plans to re-open U.S. economy - Reuters,,"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) April 17 (Reuters) - European stock index futures surged more than 3% on Friday, as U.S. President Donald Trump rolled out plans for a gradual re-opening of the economy and on reports of a potential drug to treat the COVID-19 disease. Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 3.3% at 0600 GMT, with German DAX, French CAC and FTSE 100 futures jumping between 2.8% and 3.4%, shrugging off data showing China suffered its worst economic contraction in almost three decades. The benchmark STOXX 600 index has rallied about 20% since hitting an eight-year low in March on the back of historic global stimulus and on hopes strict stay-at-home orders would be eased as the health crisis showed signs of ebbing. Late on Thursday, Trump laid out new guidelines for U.S. states to emerge from the shutdowns in a staggered, three-stage approach, sending S&P 500 futures to a near five-week high.

4,The NY Times exposes real reason behind coronavirus hype: Crash the market to harm Trump’s reelection,Anonymous,"For Americans who see the Democrat Left behind the over-hyped media coverage and societal reactions to the coronavirus ‘pandemic,’ The New York Times, God bless ’em, just proved those suspicions correct. And wouldn’t you know it, the strategy is a familiar one: Use a manufactured crisis to get rid of President Donald Trump. Oh, true, coronavirus is real enough, But given it’s so-far minuscule infection rate in the U.S. (1,600 or so), death rate (~40), and the fact that more than half of patients infected by the disease globally have already recovered, there is no reason to shutter professional sports seasons or declare states of emergency when you have a single case of the virus in your state. Not at this point. Yet, those things — and more, including bans on public gatherings — have happened. Why? Think November 2020. Under the headline, “Trump’s Re-election Chances Suddenly Look Shakier,” the Times reports: President Trump faces the biggest challenge yet to his prospects of being re-elected, with his advisers’ two major assumptions for the campaign — a booming economy and an opponent easily vilified as too far left — quickly evaporating. After a year in which Mr. Trump has told voters that they must support his re-election or risk watching the economy decline, the stock market is reeling and economists are warning that a recession could be on the horizon because of the worsening spread of the coronavirus. And instead of elevating Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Mr. Trump made clear was his hope, Democrats have suddenly and decisively swung from a flirtation with socialism to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has run a primary campaign centered on a return to political normalcy. “Biden’s success in the suburbs makes him an acceptable alternative to Trump,” said Scott Reed, the top political adviser for the United States Chamber of Commerce. “His turnout in the suburbs threatens the Republican Senate.” Said Kevin DeWine, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, to the Times — and this is telling: “If it was Warren or Bernie and you don’t have coronavirus, I think Trump might sneak by. But if it’s Biden, ‘My I.R.A. has tanked,’ and we’re going to have complete disruption because of coronavirus, I think it’s a totally different story.” The Times concedes: Of course, what happens in March may ultimately have little bearing in November. Mr. Trump maintains the bully pulpit of the presidency, and Mr. Biden largely avoided intense scrutiny from rivals in a crowded, up-and-down primary campaign. And if there’s any constant in the Trump era, it is that what’s in the news at a given moment will change in a matter of hours, days or at most weeks. The virus may be mitigated, the economy could rebound, and Mr. Biden’s decades of life in Washington and propensity for gaffes may render him as weak a candidate as some of his rivals in the primary had long predicted. Yet if Mr. Trump does lose re-election, the seeds of demise may prove to have been planted in early spring. There is no way Joe “Gaffe” Biden has a shot in Hades against Trump this fall unless certain economic and social conditions occur. Or are exploited thanks to the timely occurrence of events. We didn’t figure it would be long before the real intention behind all the sports cancellations, states of emergencies declared by Democratic governors, and outsized Democratic congressional responses to a so-far limited viral outbreak — not to mention the asinine tanking of the stock market — were revealed. And the Times didn’t let us down. Consider — and this should anger every single American who has their retirement savings wrapped up in investment vehicles and 401(k) accounts: The Democratic Left is proving beyond any doubt they are willing to burn down your savings and your future just to get a short-term political victory. We have words for people like that but we won’t publish them.",1,
386,Peru: riot police block highway as people attempt to flee amid lockdown | World news | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-collyns,"Riot police in Peru have blockaded a major highway and fired teargas into crowds of people attempting to flee the capital city and return on foot to their rural hometowns as the countryâ€™s strict coronavirus lockdown entered its sixth week. Local television images on Monday showed hundreds of families, including young children, trekking along highways with their belongings on their backs as they made long journeys to family homes. Poor Peruvians have been trying to leave Lima since last week, many saying they had to choose between hunger or homelessness in the city or risking exposure to Covid-19 as they attempt to return home. â€œHere in Lima there are no longer any jobs, there is no longer any way to pay for food, we do not have any more savings,â€ Maricela de la Cruz told the Associated Press. â€œWe have done everything possible to stay the 30 quarantine days. Now we want to go back because we have a house, family, we have someone who can support us â€“ here in Lima we have absolutely no one,â€ said De la Cruz, who was trying to return to Huancayo, in Peruâ€™s central Andes. Despite imposing some of the most stringent quarantine measures in Latin America since mid-March, Peru reported 16,325 coronavirus cases and 400 deaths on Monday, a figure which placed it second only to Brazil in the number of infections in the region. Brazil has a population seven times larger than Peru. Yet the response of the Peruvian president, MartÃ­n Vizcarra, and his Brazilian counterpart could not be more different. While the Brazilian leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has consistently flouted social distancing rules and downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic, Vizcarra is widely seen by Peruvians to have reacted decisively to the pandemic, deploying troops and the police to enforce a lockdown and a nightly curfew. Vizcarra said on Monday that the weeks ahead would be the most difficult and would require â€œeveryoneâ€™s highest capacity to respondâ€. â€œThe number of patients is close to exceeding the capacity of the health service,â€ he said. Alonso Segura, a former Peruvian finance minister, said the mass movements of people to the countryside showed the state response was pushed to its limits, despite having launched a huge stimulus package worth 90bn soles (Â£21bn) â€“ equivalent to about 12% of GDP â€“ last month, which included millions of fortnightly cash transfers to poor families. More than 70% of Peruvians work in the unregulated economy, according to the countryâ€™s statistics institute. â€œThe government cannot push the severe lockdown much longer,â€ said Segura. â€œCompanies are going bankrupt and the desperation of the people is increasing. More than an economic issue, itâ€™s a social issue,â€ he added.",0,
230,"Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will be harmed or killed by his coronavirus vaccines",Ethan Huff,"In his rush to develop one, two, or even seven different vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), billionaire software tycoon Bill Gates openly admitted that upwards of 700,000 people could become injured or die from these jabs.

The Microsoft co-founder and prominent eugenicist has been more outspoken in recent days than perhaps ever before about his desire to vaccinate the entire world, in this case as soon as possible for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And the reality is that many more will die from the vaccine than from the virus itself.

Speaking during a recent segment on CNBC, Gates admitted that in order to make vaccines “work” for the most vulnerable groups, they have to be super-charged, in a sense. And this super-charging means that some people are going to be injured or killed as a result.

“We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that,” Gates stated about his plans for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination.

“And doing that so that you amp it up so that it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects, if we have one in 10,000 side effects that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that.”

Bill Gates also says flu vaccines do not work for older people
During this same interview, Gates admitted something that we, too, have reported on: that influenza vaccines are pretty much useless in older people.

Though supposedly high-risk seniors are pushed to get their flu shots annually, Gates confessed to the fact that this yearly ritual does nothing to protect them against the flu.

“The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge,” Gates stated. “It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people.”

“And that actual decision of, ok, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world, governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed.”

In his own analysis, Martin Armstrong of Armstrong Economics crunched the data and found that the number of deaths around the world that are being attributed to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pales in comparison to the number of people who will be injured or killed by Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, based on Gates’ own admission.

While the worldwide death count associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently right around a quarter-million, the roughly one percent of people who could potentially die from a Gates-funded Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is about triple that.

This suggests that society is better off telling Gates to hit the road and letting the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) run its course – with proper nutrition, of course.

Vaccine experiments like the ones Gates is pushing for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) have been tried before, by the way. Back in the ’70s, the United States rolled out a vaccine for “swine flu” that was administered to some 45 million people over the course of 10 weeks.

This vaccination effort was halted, however, after it was discovered that no cases of swine flu were even detected outside of the military base where it was said to have originated. Meanwhile, one in 100,000 vaccinated individuals ended up suffering from side effects that included Guillain-Barré syndrome, while another 53 died.

Because of the horrors caused by this vaccination campaign, Guillain-Barré is supposedly monitored every single flu season to ensure that influenza vaccine safety meet certain safety thresholds.

“The side effect of treason is lead poisoning or rope burn, but not usually both,” joked one Big League Politics commenter in reference to Bill Gates.

John the Baptist paved the way for Jesus,” wrote another. “Bill Gates is paving the way for the antichrist.”",1,
370,Zipline begins drone delivery of Covid-19 test samples in Ghana,Riley de Leon@RileyCNBC,"Zipline, the California-based drone-delivery start-up that delivers critical medical supplies in countries like Ghana, has begun delivering Covid-19 test samples in the country's two largest cities â€” Accra, the nation's capital, and Kumasi, the country's second-largest city. The service began Friday,  when 51 test samples were collected from patients at rural health facilities and transported to the company's distribution center in Omenako, Ghana. Over the course of four separate flights, the company delivered those 51 samples to the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research in Accra for testing and analysis. The company will also be delivering Covid-19 test samples collected at regional hospitals near its Mapong distribution center to the Kumasi Center for Collaborative Research. The first such delivery took place on Saturday, April 18. The company said it expects to operate this new daily service for the duration of the government's Covid-19 response efforts, marking the first time in history that autonomous drones have been used to make regular long-range deliveries into densely populated urban areas. It is also the first time that drones have been used in this way to deliver Covid-19 test samples. The new delivery service allows the government to more closely monitor and respond to the spread of the disease in some of the countries most remote areas. ""Zipline is dedicated to helping Ghana in its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said CEO Keller Rinaudo. ""Using contactless drone delivery to transport Covid-19 test samples will allow the government to respond to the pandemic and help save lives more quickly."" Since its launch in October 2016, the company's autonomous drones have flown more than 2 million miles and delivered more than 60,000 vaccines, units of blood and other medical products in Ghana, Rwanda and India. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, Zipline planned to launch U.S. operations in the fall of 2020, delivering to health facilities and homes.

469,"UPDATE 1-Once unthinkable, investors contemplate negative U.S. Treasury yields",,"yields@ (Updates Fed rate probability, prices throughout) March 6 (Reuters) - A collapse in Treasury yields has led investors to start preparing for the possibility that some U.S. government interest rates could turn negative, as concerns about a spreading coronavirus drive a scurry for low-risk government debt. The Federal Reserve on Tuesday made its first emergency cut since the financial crisis, dropping the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to the 1.0% to 1.25% band. The move has not satisfied markets, however, with stock markets cratering and Treasury yields continuing to plunge to record lows. Interest rate futures traders are now pricing in a 50% probability that rates will be zero-bound by April, according to the CME Groups FedWatch Tool. Even if the Fed is resistant to adopting negative rates, as most expect, Treasuries should hold their appeal as the worlds largest and most liquid market. That means that strong demand could send yields on some shorter-dated notes into negative territory, a move that seemed unthinkable only a few weeks ago. Two-year Treasury yields dropped as low as 0.292% on Monday, the lowest since October 2014, when the fed funds rate was zero-bound. Benchmark 10-year notes yields plunged to a record low of 0.469%. ""Even if the Feds effective lower bound for fed funds is still positive, there is no reason that twos, fives, even potentially 10s, couldn't trade negative,"" said Jon Hill, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. Yields on short-term Treasury bills have briefly traded negative in times of stress, but it would be unprecedented for short and intermediate-dated notes to do the same. A negative yield means investors would pay the U.S. government to hold the debt. The Fed is reluctant to cut rates into negative territory as it risks disrupting the large U.S. money market sector. There are also questions over whether negative rates have been successful at stimulating growth in other countries. ""We have a very, very large money market complex,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Societe Generale in New York. ""The Fed has resisted taking interest rates to negative territory because they dont want to disrupt the liquidity in the financial system."" On Friday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said if yields drop to zero, the Federal Reserve should consider buying a broader range of assets. ""That would be a game-changer in my opinion, as no one in their right mind would want to be short an index when against a central bank with unlimited funds,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Australian brokerage Pepperstone. ""It seems the bond vigilantes are out to get the Fed to go hard here."" Economic growth overseas has been far more sluggish than in the United States. The European Central Bank introduced negative interest rates in 2014 and the Bank of Japan followed in 2016. Two-year notes in Germany and Japan currently yield -0.86% and -0.31%, respectively. If longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields are hovering near zero, some see a risk that a new wave of buying could turn shorter-dated ones negative. ""The one thing about the Treasury market that makes it so attractive, regardless of the price is the liquidity and the depth of the market,"" said Michael Lorizio, senior fixed income trader at Manulife Asset Management. If longer-dated yields continue to drop then, ""the front-end in that scenario would be under significant pressure to maintain the positive yield,"" he added. The current bond rally is notable because investors are preparing not only for zero-bound rates, but a raft of additional measures, including quantitative easing, as the Fed battles an economic slowdown. That adds to anticipation that future yield moves may also be unprecedented. ""This is the first time were cutting back to zero with a full-blown expectation that QE will soon follow,"" said Hill. ""Were at an extremely fragile state right now in the global economy."" (Reporting by Karen Brettell; Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Alden Bentley and Clarence Fernandez)",0,

195,"IS THE CORONAVIRUS, THE BIGGEST COVER UP IN HISTORY?",The Healing Oracle Team,"As we continue to wade through the mounting evidence that the Coronavirus seems to be one big fat fake, there are more people coming forward to question these new laws that have pretty much already been made.

The toxic untested vaccines are coming and soon every single person on the planet will be forced to have them. This stuff is happening at an alarming rate and Bill Gates has been preparing for this for some time:

As we continue to expose this incredibly manipulative coronavirus story, we now wonder if this is set to become the biggest cover up in the history of mankind?

Fictional Germ warfare would seem to be winning here, as why not, they invented the rules. The rest of us are playing catch up at a far slower pace.

The people are now convinced and will do just about anything to get out of the house and back to their old lives and jobs.

Could we see the bankruptcy of countries, the end of the old supply chain, soon to be replaced by central systems? Central banking, central food supplies, all under one centralised global government.

Mass unemployment is already becoming the norm.

What will this 5G rollout mean to the health of the world? These towers kill everything that come close, trees, plants, animals, insects, humans.

Best to create a virus first, a scape goat that can then be labelled with every other death that happens. Forget Nuclear war as commander in chief Bill “The Gate Keeper” Gates stated in his 2015 TED Talk, it’s not missiles that we now need to fear, but microbes. For it was no longer nuclear weapons that would be the next big threat to humanity, but a virus. Not cancer? No not cancer, he doesn’t want us to think about that, or heart disease, or the side effects of medications and his enforced vaccinations, but a man made, mutated disease.   The bad guy is needed first in this plot.

He tells the audience how we are not ready for the next epidemic. In truth he was getting very ready: COVID-19 has actually been downgraded, so why the global shut down?

As some of you may have heard by now, CoVID-19 actually got a quiet downgrade 2 weeks ago, according to the British Governments own website, that states: “As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a “high consequence infectious disease” (HCID) in the UK.

Yet this is not being celebrated, bans being lifted, stores being re-opened, its not being reported at all and has not meant businesses re-opening, or travel being restored to normal. Why is that?

It states: “The 4 nations public health HCID group made an interim recommendation in January 2020 to classify COVID-19 as an HCID. This was based on consideration of the UK HCID criteria about the virus and the disease with information available during the early stages of the outbreak. Now that more is known about COVID-19, the public health bodies in the UK have reviewed the most up to date information about COVID-19 against the UK HCID criteria. They have determined that several features have now changed; in particular, more information is available about mortality rates (low overall), and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific and sensitive laboratory test, the availability of which continues to increase.

The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) is also of the opinion that COVID-19 should no longer be classified as an HCID.”

As Jon Rappoport points out on nomorefakenews.com the mistake is to think of this as one thing. One “disease”. One bad guy, its not, its many things being given one handy to remember label. Pollution, radiation, general ill health is now being labelled as CoVid.

The CDC that owns the patent to 56 vaccines, with over 270 in the pipeline (is that a big enough vested interest), is telling coroners to record any death that is potentially similar to what they describe as Co-Vid like symptoms as death by Co-Vid.

So that’s any type of pneumonia, or flu is being recorded as death by Coronavirus! That’s playing with the numbers, right there on the website. Whilst in the UK, GPs are not even needed to physically be there when recording a death as Co-Vid! According to The Pulse, an online resource for medical practitioners:

“ The Coronavirus Act, which was passed by Parliament yesterday and is law as of today, means it is now possible for GPs to certify death without physically attending.

The emergency laws are designed to consider the coronavirus restrictions on in-person interactions and that death may occur in households that are self-isolating, making it difficult for GPs to attend in person.

Handy that.

Italy – So it’s no surprise then that an article in Bloomberg highlights that 99% of those who were recorded to have died from the Coronavirus also had other illnesses:

“More than 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions, according to a study by the country’s national health authority.” That’s only 0.8% had no other illnesses!

The Coronavirus is not even airborne, it’s a result of 5G that’s already been implemented.

Please watch this interview that spells out many of these and more of the lies that are circulating the globe and keeping everyone locked indoors, Dr Kauffman you are a brave man. Here is the book Dr Kauffman recommends – What really makes you ill

This book will explain what really makes you ill and why everything you thought you knew about disease is wrong. “Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of whom they know nothing.” Voltaire. The conventional approach adopted by most healthcare systems entails the use of ‘medicine’ to treat human disease.

Please also visit the World Death Clock – a dynamic clock that calculates the number of people who are dying in the world every second. On an average there are 56 million deaths that take place in a year. The Corona virus is a tiny drop in the ocean.

Even after they have manipulated the numbers.

Is this paving the way for more deaths that can be attributed to this masked foe. This mysterious ficticiuos killer in our midst? Or will perhaps and maybe this is just a distant hope more and more people come forward to prove this façade is one big con.
An April Fools joke that went to far?

Not if this man has anything to do with it…

When did we elect Bill Gates?

See below, Bill the Gate keeper (the most powerful man at the WHO), appears to be acting as the new American unelected president. Did we miss the campaign? Or did we just simply skip the entire process as it takes too long when there are vaccines to rush out and skip the entire testing process due to this emergency. As now we see him weighing in on this story all over his media channels, saying the number of US cases has not yet peaked and the country won’t likely be able to return to normal life by April.

Amazing that 2 of the interviewers are there to make it look like a balanced view, whereas in reality it’s just Bill telling everyone to shut down and stay shut down until we get these numbers low. What does that mean, how low is low?

Well according to Bill Gate Keeper, these numbers need to be really low.

How is that possible when coroners are being told to record any death they may suspect to be the corona virus as Covid? With these kind of guidelines, no wonder we have not seen “the peak” of numbers.

That’s pretty scary when you consider that the numbers now, with all the fixing going on are already pretty low in comparison to the population of the USA.

Mass herding

Whilst social distancing and herding everyone home also seems to suddenly be the preferred route. We can’t help thinking, if this virus is supposed to be everywhere, why do you need to go back to the country on your passport, irrespective of whether you have a home in that country or not? Why are they making people travel back home. If this virus was to be contained surely the advice would be to stay put and sit it out? Why do they need everyone to go back to their home country? It’s all about the database linked to your ID and your passport.

Litterally like sheep herding. Get them all back in the barn so you can stamp them.

Bloomsberg reported on how the Gates Foundation planned and practised for the coronavirus “germ game” in a simulation only 4 months ago in New York called Event 201.

Preparing business leaders for a Pandemic, Bill Gates calls it “Germ games,” but meant that business leaders and health chiefs were already prepped and knew what to say.

The ID2020 Alliance combines vaccines with implantable microchips to create your digital ID. In a Reddit Q&A, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates revealed his plan to use ‘digital certificates’ to identify those who have been tested for COVID-19:

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will launch human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can show who has been tested for the coronavirus and who has been vaccinated against it.

The 64 year old “tech mogul” and most powerful medical figure on the planet, revealed this yesterday during a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything’ session while answering questions on the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic.

According to Business Insider Bills Microchip ID is already being paid for:

The CDC will set up a coronavirus ‘surveillance and data collection system’ as part of the $2 trillion stimulus bill, which President Trump just signed into law

President Donald Trump signed into law a sweeping stimulus bill that will pump emergency funding into the CDC to combat the coronavirus, including a system to gather data on how the virus is spreading.

Of the funding allocated to the CDC, the stimulus sets aside at least $500 million for public health data surveillance and modernizing the analytics infrastructure. The CDC must report on the development of a “surveillance and data collection system” within the next 30 days. While it’s not clear what form that surveillance system will take, the federal government has reportedly expressed interest in aggregating data that can be gleaned from tech platforms and smartphone use to monitor movement patterns.

Yet, according to the top expert in the USA, Dr Fauci states that Co-Vid19 may be more like influenza, with a case fatality rate of more like 0.01%

Whilst social distancing and herding everyone home seems to suddenly be the preferred route. We can’t help thinking, if this virus is supposed to be everywhere, why do you need to go back to the country on your passport, irrespective of whether you have a home in that country or not? Why are they making people travel back home. If this virus was to be contained surely the advice would be to stay put and sit it out? Why do they need everyone to go back to their home country?

57,Beijing Believes COVID-19 Is a Biological Weapon,Lucas Leiroz de Almeida,"From conspiracy theory to geopolitical realism, the possibility to treat COVID-19 as a biological weapon has been finally accepted in the public sphere. The recent statement by the Chinese spokesman Zhao Lijian, formally accusing the US of bringing coronavirus to China, has highlighted a series of new opinions about the pandemic. The hypothesis of biological warfare behind the global pandemic had already been raised by Russian experts some weeks ago. Like any opinion that is slightly different from the official version of Western governments and their media agencies, the thesis was ridiculed and accused of being a “conspiracy theory”. However, as soon as the official spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the second largest economic power on the planet publishes a note attesting to this possibility, it leaves the sphere of “conspiracy theories” to enter the scene of public opinion and official government versions. In addition to making the explanation of biological warfare official, Zhao Lijian raised important questions about the pandemic data in the USA: “When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” The supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, ordered on the same day of the declaration of the Chinese Ministry the creation of a unified center of scientific research specialized in the fight against the coronavirus. The motivation, according to the Iranian spiritual and political leader, was motivated by evidence that the pandemic is a biological attack. These are his words: “The establishment of a headquarters to fight the outbreak [of COVID-19] occurs due to the presence of evidence that indicates the possibility of a biological attack, signaling that it is necessary that all coping services [to the coronavirus] be under the command of a unified headquarters”. In fact, what the mainstream Western media has called a “conspiracy” has been manifested in US defense programs for a long time. We must briefly recall the official document named “Rebuilding America’s Defenses”, published by the conservative think tank “Project for a new American Century”, where we can clearly read: “(…) advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool “.

Taking into account that the document was published in 2000, we can see that the possibility of biological warfare has been carefully considered and worked on by American strategists for at least two decades. However, the projects are even older. This article published in Global Research tells a brief history of biological warfare technology, tracing the remote origins of this practice by the American armed forces. In this genealogy of biological warfare, we find reports of the use of bio-weapons in wars in great conflicts of the last century, such as the Second World War, the Korea War and the conflicts with Cuba. Even so, until last Thursday, the mere fact of mentioning this hypothesis for the new coronavirus was rejected as conspiracy.

We must attain to concrete data: Pentagon has 400 military laboratories around the world, whose activities are still obscure; the USA has not yet made a clear statement about the COVID-19 data in its territory, having not yet informed the identity of its patient zero and maintaining uncertain information about the number of infected; Chinese scientists conducted a complex study in which they concluded that the virus did not originate in China, but that it had multiple and diverse sources from the HuaAnonymous marine seafood market from where the virus subsequently spread.

In February, the Japanese media agency Ashi TV reported that the virus originated in the U.S., not China, and that Washington would be omitting its actual numbers, with some cases of death attributed to influenza being, in fact, camouflaged cases of coronavirus; on February 27, a Taiwanese virologist presented a series of flowcharts on a TV program, corroborating the thesis that the virus has an American origin, providing a scientific explanation to the flow of the virus sources devoid of any geopolitical purpose. Another curious fact is that China has been unexpectedly affected by epidemic phenomena, particularly during the period of the trade war between Beijing and Washington. Only between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the country recorded epidemic episodes of H7N4, H7N9 (two variations of bird flu) and African swine flu. Also, the US has not officially responded to any of these notes, remaining silent about the coronavirus situation in its territory. Not proposing a concrete answer, but only speculations, we can consider that the circumstances of the case present us a very extensive list of possibilities about what in fact the coronavirus is. Obviously, it is possible that it is not a biological weapon – and this is the official version of most of the media agencies and governments – however, once this hypothesis has been raised and no concrete evidence to the contrary is presented, it is also possible that it is a biological weapon. The most important thing to do is to dispel the myth that biological wars are conspiracy theories. We must begin to take this possibility seriously and analyze the evidences in search of real solutions. Biological weapons are methods that have long been used and that form a fundamental part of modern warfare, whose costs are less than the methods of direct confrontation of the old wars of mobilization – and whose benefits are greater.",1,
344,Coronavirus UK: Nick Ferrari confronts Tory MP following Dorries' coronavirus news | UK | News | Express.co.uk,Alessandra Scotto di Santolo," Ms Dorries announced she tested positive to coronavirus on Tuesday night, adding she would be self-isolate as per the advice received by NHS 111. The news sparked fears other MPs and Prime Minister Boris Johnson could also have contracted the deadly virus in recent meetings with the Health Minister. Nick Ferrari confronted Tory MP Anthony Browne on the issue. He asked: â€œArenâ€™t you concerned you could be a super spreader, Mr Browne?â€ The Tory MP replied: â€œIâ€™m taking all the precautions that weâ€™re advised to take and we are very much following scientific and medical advice on this from the Chief Medical Officer. â€œIâ€™ve been washing my hands regularly, trying to avoid shaking hands unless absolutely necessary. â€œAnd Nadine Dorries is actually whatsapping at the moment, so she is actually on the up. â€œSheâ€™s feeling an awful better which is fantastic news and I think Parliament should carry on.â€ READ MORE: Coronavirus: Are you at risk of death from the virus?    There are no plans to test any ministers, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for coronavirus after Health Minister Nadine Dorries became the first MP to be diagnosed with COVID-19. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said ministers would not need to undergo testing as Public Health England (PHE) worked to advise those who have been in close contact with Ms Dorries. PHE said it had assessed the risk of Ms Dorries' individual close contacts and only those with symptoms need to self-isolate. For each COVID-19 case, a risk assessment is carried out and advice tailored to that group, a spokeswoman said. Labour MP for York Central Rachael Maskell said she is self-isolating on the advice of 111 following a meeting with the health minister last Thursday. It comes as a 53-year-old British woman was reported to have died from COVID-19 in Indonesia, with the Foreign Office offering support to her family. Ms Maskell tweeted: ""NHS111 have advised that I self-isolate as a result of a meeting I had with the Government's Mental Health Minister last Thursday who has subsequently tested positive for Coronavirus. Thankfully I am asymptomatic. It is so important that we all follow all public health advice.""

32,IMPORTANCE OF VITAMIN C DURING AN EPIDEMIC,Andrew W. Saul,"The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C. Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular. It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness. But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.“I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.”(Robert F. Cathcart, MD)The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. 

The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:

Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams (or more) daily, in divided doses.

Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000)

Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form)

Zinc: 20 mg daily

Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily

Vitamin C [1], Vitamin D [2], magnesium [3], zinc [4], and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s.[6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980.[7]

It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?The peer-reviewed Orthomolecular Medicine News Service is a non-profit and non-commercial informational resource.For more information: http://www.orthomolecular.org",1,
259,China EXPOSED: Chinese President XI Jinping ‘maliciously’ spread coronavirus with ‘unthinkable’ secret plot,Gerrard Kaonga,"CHINA may have used the deadly coronavirus pandemic to “even the playing field” on the world stage, an expert has claimed, as the communist nation’s initial response to the crisis is scrutinised.

Asia political expert and author Gordon Chang claimed China‘s President Xi Jinping‘s actions suggest he intended to spread coronavirus around the world – something the communist nation has always denied. During an interview with Express.co.uk, Mr Chang said he believed China had behaved maliciously and he claims there was evidence to suggest they had taken steps to attack all nations of the world. He also insisted the origin of the virus was not as important as scrutinising China for how they behaved at the beginning of the pandemic.

Mr Chang said: “China maliciously spread this disease beyond its borders.

“This could have been accidental release from a lab or it could have been from the wet market, who knows?

“But what is important is not how the disease started but rather what Beijing did in response to it.”

He continued: “We, of course, don’t know what was in Xi Jinping’s mind.

“But after having seen what the coronavirus did to cripple China, if he wanted to level the playing field by spreading the disease beyond his borders, he would have done exactly what he did do.

“This was malicious and the first time in history one country has attacked all others.

“As we come to terms with that, China has a lot to lose.”

Mr Chang also highlighted the key concerns he had with China’s initial reaction to the coronavirus pandemic.

He questioned the information coming out of China and highlighted his fears the secretive country was willing and hoping to deceive the world.

He said: “Beijing only announced human-human transmission on January 20 but doctors in Wuhan knew that the second week of December.

“If during that interim period China had said nothing that would have been grossly irresponsible.

“But what Beijing tried to do was to deceive the world into thinking that it was not human to human transmission.”

He claims that China pressured other nations to continue to allow travel from China, despite their knowledge of the dangerousness of the virus.

He continued: “At the same time Beijing knew that people could spread this, it pressured countries to not impose travel restriction and quarantines on arrivals from China.

“You put those two facts together and you come to an unthinkable conclusion.”

President Xi Jinping caused outrage earlier this week when he announced China had behaved responsibly and transparently with the rest of the world during the coronavirus pandemic.

President Xi also claimed China had turned the tide on the virus and protected the life and well being of its people.

China has consistently urged the United States to stop what it sees as virus slander.

The US should stop wasting time in its fight against the coronavirus and work with China to combat it, rather than spreading lies and attacking the country, the Chinese government’s top diplomat Wang Yi said on Sunday.

State Councillor Wang, speaking at his annual news conference on the sidelines of China’s parliament, expressed his deep sympathies to the United States for the pandemic, where the death toll is expected to surpass 100,000 in the coming days, the highest number of any country.

“Regretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States. This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China,” said Wang, who is also China’s foreign minister.

“Some politicians have ignored the most basic facts and concocted too many lies about China and plotted too many conspiracies,” he added.

“I want to say here: Don’t waste precious time any longer, and don’t ignore lives,” Wang said.

“What China and the United States need to do the most is to first learn from each other and share their experience in fighting against the epidemic, and help each country fight it.”

“China has always advocated that, as the world’s largest developing country and the largest developed country, both of us bear a major responsibility for world peace and development,” he said. “China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation, and lose from confrontation.”",1,
169,PHENOMENA OF CORONAVIRUS CRISIS,Anonymous,"FiAnonymouscial circles and governments are using the coronavirus crisis in order to achieve own fiAnonymouscial and political goals, as well as to cover crissi developments in the global economy (the Saudi offensive on the oil market is another sign of the crisis);
The outbreak is exploited by the Washington establishment and its allies to increase pressure on the opponents of the US-dominated global order. China became the first target of the attack. Now, similar developments could be observed in Russia. Large Russian cities and even government bodies (like the foreign ministry) are being targeted by waves of fake news and artificial hysteria. Anti-government, Western-backed forces operating inside Russia will likely work to exploit the coronavirus narrative to destabilize the situation in the country;
The virus outbreak became a useful pretext for a further regionalization of the world that breaks into seprated economic political clusters. The myth about the ‘European unity’ as well as the ‘Euro-Atlantic’ one is destroyed. All states are fighting the crisis almost alone. Only so-called “bad guys” like China, Venezuela or Cuba are offering their help to other states;",1,
278,Boxing news: Kell Brook gives up on Amir Khan fight and set sights on pound-for-pound star | Boxing | Sport | Express.co.uk,Matt Penn," Kell Brook has given up any hope of fighting fierce rival Amir Khan in an all-British clash because it's 'gone past the line' for the Sheffield fighter. Brook has instead set his sights on Terence Crawford. Khan and Brook have been tipped to fight each other in a huge stadium clash over the years, with promoter Eddie Hearn trying his best to make it happen. The pair have always entered a war of words with each other, but they've gone their separate ways over the last few years. Brook lost big fights to Gennady Golovkin and Errol Spence while Khan lost to Canelo Alvarez and Crawford. JUST IN: Eddie Hearn lifts lid on plans for boxing marathon after lockdown  It was just last year that Khan was stopped in the sixth round by Crawford, which Brook was present in New York for. Back then, Brook lobbied for a fight with Crawford, but talks for a bout with Khan picked up steam again late last year. But it seems talks are dead in the water again, and Brook wants Crawford after winning his comeback fight against Mark DeLuca in February.

109,COVID-19: CHINESE HEALTH AUTHORITIES CONFIRM PATIENT ZERO ‘HAD SEX WITH BATS’,Anonymous,"Chinese health authorities have confirmed the identity of the patient zero from whom the first case of coronavirus has originated.
Yin Dao Tang, 24, from the province of Hubei, is the first case of the novel coronavirus that emerged on November 17, according to Chinese government data.
Tang is believed to have contracted the disease after indulging in sexual acts with several animals, including bats. “We believe that patient zero has contracted COVID-19 through oral, genital or anal sexual penetration with various animals, especially bats,” Chinese officials said yesterday. “I apologize for my son’s sexual deviances but he has always complained that there are no women to have sex with in China, only men,” patient zero’s father told reporters.
Chinese officials have warned to temporarily abstain from having sexual contact with any animals, especially with bats.
“We ask the population to abstain temporarily from oral, genital or anal sexual contact with animals, especially bats,” Chinese officials warned citizens yesterday.
The Chinese government said it would consider fines and prison time to enforce that the population temporarily abstains from sexual contact with animals until the pandemic is fully controlled.
China’s millennial-old cultural traditions have made the bat a synonym of healthy sexual appetite, longevity, good eyesight and luck and are a popular dish in the region of Hubei.",1,

In a new press release, the Buckingham Palace has confirmed that the Queen of the United Kingdom has indeed tested positive. The 93-year-old could have come into contact with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who tested positive yesterday. The Royal Palace said in the statement: “HMQ has also tested positive and is currently self-isolating at Windsor Castle. The Queen came into contact with the PM on the 11th March and is following all the appropriate advice with regards to her welfare”. “We will be sharing constant updates of the Queen’s welfare with the public in good fate.

396,Resistance to Fifa is futile: fall in line or prepare to be Normalised | Barney Ronay | Football | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barneyronay,"Nobody wants a visit from the Normalisation Committee. This was the fate of the Samoan FA in June 2008 after concerns were raised about the state of its finances. At which point Fifa fired up the corvette and sent in its platoon of tuxedoed Mr Fix-its. Letâ€™s be clear. Nobody wants a visit from this Normalisation Committee. The team of high moral priests sent to the Samoan FAâ€™s door that day were handpicked by a specially convened Fifa emergency committee, a delegation that read, in no particular order: Sepp Blatter, Jack Warner, Issa Hayatou, Michel Platini, Reynald Temarii, Mohammad bin Hammam and NicolÃ¡s Leoz. Or to give them their full Seven Dwarves-style nicknames: Six Year Ban Guy, Criminal Charges Guy, TV Rights Fine Guy, Dishonest Payment Guy, Eight Year Ban Guy, Life Ban Guy and of course everyoneâ€™s favourite crime-fighting administrator, Interpol Red Notice Guy. Here they come, the lads: a perfumed kerchief held to their noses, here to de-corrupt your football association. Twelve years on the Samoa emergency committee is arguably one of the best jokes modern football has ever come up with. Just how abnormal do you have to be to require this degree of normalising? But then these were the golden years of footballing chicanery, when the yak-hide handbags flowed like wine and when Fifa could basically do as it wished. The anomaly was that Samoa fought back. In a rare show of resistance the Samoan FA appealed to the court of arbitration for sport. It didnâ€™t work. The appeal was rejected and the good times continued to roll at Fifa house, reaching a peak with the bribe-shadowed World Cup bid decisions that would prove an act of hubris even for that thoroughly debauched regime. And so to the present day. Replace one bald, unctuous Swiss with a slightly younger bald, unctuous Swiss and something similar is happening in the Caribbean, a test case for where we may be heading in the struggle for the heart, soul and wallet of world football. The Trinidad & Tobago FA experienced its own visit from the Fifa Normalisers in March after another shemozzle over debt. Like Samoa the TTFA has fought back. Another appeal has been lodged at Cas, this time via crowdfunded legal action. Fifaâ€™s move does seem bizarrely aggressive. The deposed TTFA committee had been in place for only four months, having seen off Gianni Infantinoâ€™s favoured candidate David John-Williams in a local vote. The TTFA board member Keith Look Loy has accused Fifa of acting like â€œa colonial absentee landlordâ€. The former Newcastle, West Ham and Portsmouth goalkeeper Shaka Hislop has called the intervention â€œa coupâ€. In an excellent twist the leader of the ousted rebel FA is even called William Wallace. They can take our lives but theyâ€™ll never take â€¦ our freebies. Much has been made by the ancien rÃ©gime of Look Loy and coâ€™s historic association with the disgraced Jack Warner, once of the Samoan Normalisation Committee and now avoiding the US justice system. Asked about rumours he might have lobbied for the Wallace campaign â€“ something Wallace fiercely denies â€“ Warner told the broadcaster Andre Errol Baptiste of Port of Spain-based i95.5fm: â€œEven if that was the case, and by the way that is not the case, and it means that is the beginning of the way to lift football in the country, so be it. Whatâ€™s wrong with that?â€ Which pretty much clears that one up. What is actually happening here? This might feel like a dispute at the edge of things, with plenty that is undesirable on both sides, but Fifaâ€™s actions seem extraordinarily high-handed and patrician, even by its own standards, evidence of the increasing hawkishness of the Infantino regime. As the Norwegian Josimar website has pointed out the man in charge of all this normalisation is even one of Infantinoâ€™s best friends, his old university chum VÃ©ron Mosengo-Omba. This matters right now. There is a great deal up for grabs a month into the total collapse of club footballâ€™s broadcast rights power base. This perhaps explains why Fifaâ€™s public statements during the Covid-19 crisis have been almost alarmingly relaxed. Fifa may suspend all international football. Fifa may, we hear, dig into its Â£2bn cash fund to bail out clubs and leagues. â€œNever let a serious crisis go to wasteâ€ is an overused line in the current uncertainty but you can bet Infantino has it inked on the back of his hand. Make no mistake Fifa has a great deal to gain at a time when every entity that has tried to resist its power, from Premier League to Uefa to the poor old TTFA, is significantly weakened. The collapse of the Blatter-Warner-Platini era hit Fifa hard but not that hard. Money continued to flow but what Fifa really wants is power, most noticeably in its shadow-struggle with club football, where Infantino is convinced it is Fifaâ€™s destiny to take a stronger role. This seemed to be coming to a head late last year as Florentino PÃ©rez presented a breakaway plan led by the richest clubs to cut out domestic leagues, with Fifa seemingly in close, approving pursuit. Exciting new plans come and go. This one seemed as likely as so many others but Covid-19 has shifted the picture even further. Every league, every club is facing a financial nosedive, their power tied inexorably to those freeze-framed TV deals. â€œFootball can â€“ and I believe will â€“ play a big part in helping our world recover,â€ Infantino mused last week, no doubt pondering the majesty of his organisationâ€™s bank balance and with the next major Fifa payday safely tucked away in late 2022. Nobody really knows what the world will look like once normalisation returns to all of us but some certainties do remain. Resistance, as the case of the TTFA demonstrates, is still futile and right now Fifa is in a position to bend that future to its will.",0,

Very few people are talking about it, and even fewer are bothering to object, but by borrowing and spending so much money our politicians are essentially feeding America’s fiAnonymouscial future into a wood chipper. 

It took from the founding of our country all the way to 1981 before the U.S. national debt reached one trillion dollars.

Incredibly, we just added more than a trillion dollars to our national debt in less than a month.


On April 5th, we were 23.9 trillion dollars in debt, and by May 4th we were 25 trillion dollars in debt.

Fear of the coronavirus has caused nearly all of our politicians to suddenly become socialists, and we are being told that trillions more in spending may be coming.


Alex Jones dissects the global elites’ plan to end the natural cycle of human reproduction in favor of a silicon based synthetic life system where cyborgs and robots ultimately replace men and women.

This is complete and utter lunacy, and we are leaving future generations of Americans with a mountain of debt that would absolutely crush them.

But of course our society may not even last too much longer at the rate we are going.

For years I have been loudly warning that our absurd national debt is an existential threat to America’s future, but at this point both major political parties have completely abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility.

Now our national debt is rapidly speeding toward the 26 trillion dollar mark, and the House of Representatives just passed a bill that would borrow and spend an additional 3 trillion dollars that we do not currently have…Since we are destroying the nation anyway, why don’t we make the grand total a nice round 10 trillion dollars like the progressives at the Atlantic are suggesting?

After all, we added close to 10 trillion dollars to the national debt during the Obama years and hardly anyone seemed to mind.

Of course Trump is trying to outdo Obama.  We have already added more than 5 trillion dollars to the national debt while he has been in office, and it looks like more “coronavirus relief bills” could be on the way.

Yes, borrowing and spending money that we do not have gives us an economic boost in the present.

But it is also money that we are stealing from future generations, and we are systematically destroying the bright future that they were supposed to have.

Since Barack Obama’s first day in the White House, we have been stealing an average of more than 100 million dollars from our children and our grandchildren every single hour of every single day.

And under Trump, that pace has actually increased.

I know that figure is difficult to believe, but run the numbers yourself and you will see that I am correct.

What we are doing to future generations is beyond criminal, and it should make every American deeply angry.

But instead, many Americans are convinced that we aren’t spending enough.

In fact, Mark Cuban believes that the government should be issuing $1,000 checks to each household every two weeks…Everybody knows that you should never go full Weimar Republic, but since we are essentially doing that already, why not make it $10,000 for every household every two weeks?

After all, $1,000 doesn’t go as far as it once did.  These days, you can blow $1,000 in a single trip to the grocery store.

Of course I am being facetious.  We are literally watching our leaders destroy everything that all previous generations of Americans fought so hard to build, and it is absolutely infuriating.

At this point even the ultra-liberal Washington Post is admitting that “the national debt is out of control”, but of course the Post also keeps on promoting ultra-liberal spending policies.

We are like a morbidly obese guy that can’t even fit in his own bathtub anymore because he is so addicted to food.  Our addiction is debt, and no matter how loud the warnings get we are just going to keep going back for more.

Ultimately, the only way that the U.S. is going to be able to service this exploding debt is to wildly devalue the currency.  This is the road that the Weimar Republic, Venezuela and so many others have gone down, and it always ends in utter disaster.

Only this time the biggest economy on the entire planet is doing it, and the currency that we are devaluing is the reserve currency of the world.

Sadly, there is no turning back now.  Both political parties are completely committed to this course, and the mainstream media is fully behind them.  In fact, CNN insists that “now is not the time to cut back on the borrowing”.

So when will be the time to cut back on borrowing?

If we need to add trillions to the national debt to deal with a relatively minor crisis like this coronavirus pandemic, what in the world are we going to do when really bad stuff starts happening?

Last November, I was absolutely horrified when our national debt hit the 23 trillion dollar mark.  But by the time this November rolls around, we might be at the 27 or 28 trillion dollar mark.

Unfortunately, we throw the word “trillion” around so much these days that most Americans don’t even realize how much money a trillion dollars actually is.

If you would have been spending a million dollars every single day since Jesus was born, you still would not have spent a trillion dollars by now.

We are talking about an amount of money that is absolutely unimaginable, and we just added that much money to the national debt in less than a month.

Thanks to our free spending politicians and everyone that is supporting them, there is now no future for this country.

We are literally committing national suicide in front of the whole world, but we are so utterly consumed by our addiction that we don’t even realize that we should be deeply ashamed of ourselves.",1,
226,Coronavirus and the Constitution: Entering the Not-So-Brave New World,Prof. Lynn Wolfe,"Two months have passed since the lockdown began, and statistics indicate that the coronavirus death toll hasn’t risen as high as we might have supposed. Yet already we hear rhetoric of a “post-COVID world,” hauntingly reminiscent of the “post-9/11 world.” However, unlike the tangible event of 9/11, COVID is a threat of an entirely different nature, an “invisible enemy.”

The enemy isn’t “out there” to defeat in the old-fashioned way, with bombs and machine guns. But all the same, its pervasiveness renders us into a constant state of paranoia. Even our loved ones become potential threats; we all pose a risk to those around us, therefore perpetrating the omnipresent danger.

To use the post-9/11 term, we are all terrorists. That’s why we must stay under house arrest until a treatment is produced to save us from ourselves. The alphabet agencies even gave us a script: we’re supposed to play the part of Sleeping Beauty as we await Prince Charming’s cure for our mysterious ailment.

But the problem with fairytales is they fall apart under scrutiny; we struggle to believe in the knight in shining armor because experience has taught us again and again that he doesn’t exist.

So it is with tales spun by government officials. The real Sleeping Beauty still needs to pay the bills, and a check of $1200 simply won’t do. She doesn’t have time to wait around for Bill Gates to unveil the miracle vaccine. And by the time he does, who will still believe the fairytale? As fatalities continue not to skyrocket and hospitals are underwhelmed, life goes on….Everyday events begin to overshadow media induced hysteria. The spell breaks; the masquerade ends.

Yet the question remains: will the sociopolitical climate restabilize after the invisible enemy’s defeat? We’ve entered a Brave New Normal, we are repeatedly told. Life so eerily resembles the flick Contagion that we might be tempted to fast-forward and spoil the ending.

Is the final solution portrayed there a realistic possibility? Imagine — a cashless economy (since cash is germ-ridden), centralized global government, and militarized police force guiding the frightened masses like shepherds watching over their flock! The CDC’s contribution to that particular film production suggests they think it could solve the problem. The cure therefore must not only be physical, but socioeconomic.

So, suddenly the government cares more intensely about citizen health than most citizens care about their own health. The TRACE Act permits contact tracers to keep an eye on whether we’ve crossed paths with the invisible enemy; with Operation Warp Speed, troops will administer vaccines door to door.

But all of this reveals the patronizing mindset of our benevolent shepherds. We are no longer to trust our own research and direct experience — after all, unlike other flus, this one has the curious tendency of manifesting no symptoms. Instead we are to place our wellbeing into the hands of contact tracers, the WHO, the military, anyone other than ourselves.

In other words, we’re allowing authority to dictate reality, and furthermore our every movement.

But if we ignore all of this and go about our business, aren’t we at risk of spreading The Virus? Doubtfully — but if we allow the Naziesque strategies of “flattening the curve” to escalate, we certainly put our liberties at risk. Our Constitutional rights — freedom of speech, religion, and assembly to name a few — have come under fire behind the veneer of “health and safety” measures against the seemingly almighty Virus.

Meanwhile, many of us suspect that if we defend our God-given rights, the invisible enemy will fade like smoke — or like any other virus.",1,

48,Photo Shows Pence Team Trying to Pray Away Coronavirus,Michael Stone,"On social media, conservative Christians cheered at the embarrassing photo showing Vice President Pence and his coronavirus team wallowing in ignorant superstition and willful ignorance. According to EurAsia Review, the official White House photo by D. Myles Cullen depicts Vice President Mike Pence meeting with the President’s Coronavirus Task Force earlier this week in the West Wing of the White House. Commenting on the story, Hemant Mehta at Friendly Atheist notes: It’s not a joke when people say these Republicans are trying to stop a virus with prayer. What else did anyone expect? Science? Reason? Something sensible? Of course not. While it is disturbing and heartbreaking to know that the man in charge of protecting the nation from the coronavirus would resort to something as useless as prayer, it is not surprising. In fact, it is no secret that Pence is a radical religious extremist.

Indeed, Pence is a terrible choice to lead any scientific or medical endeavor. The man is a dangerous Christian extremist who rejects science in favor of religious superstition.

Pence believes that creationism should be taught in public schools.

When serving as a congressman, Pence made it clear that he opposes evolution, and believes that only creationism (intelligent design) provides a “rational explanation for the known universe.”

Pence thinks the government should pay for gay conversion therapy.

In 2015, as Governor of Indiana, Pence allowed an HIV outbreak to spread, choosing prayer over a clean needle exchange. As a result of Pence taking the time to “pray on it,” citizens of his state suffered and died.

In addition to rejecting evolution, promoting gay conversion therapy, and allowing a deadly HIV epidemic to spread by choosing prayer over science, Pence has also claimed that condoms are “too modern and too liberal.”

Bottom line: Conservative Christians cheer while reasonable people are horrified at the sight of Pence’s team trying to pray away the coronavirus.

64,The COVID-19 Crisis in the U.S.: How Many More Innocent People Have to Die?,Prof. Joseph H. Chung,"The COVID-19 is sweeping the U.S. land leaving behind mountains of dead bodies. This is just incredible. Soon, millions of persons may be inflicted. God knows how many more lives will be sacrificed.

What is frightening is the disorderly easing of lockdown and social distancing in many states, which will surely bring another upsurge of infected people and deaths.

The U.S. is the richest country in the world. Its GDP in 2019 was $21.4 trillion; its GDP per capita was $ 65,000. Militarily, it is the most powerful country in the world and in human history.

It is therefore normal that the world was expecting Washington to show how to fight the global enemy, COVID-19.

The world is disappointed. It is worried. But it is hoping to see the Americans conquer the virus, with dignity, as citizens of the most powerful nation in the world.

This paper argues that the following factors are responsible for Washington’s less than poor performance: China bashing, the counter-productive legacy of neo-liberalism and the doubtful quality of leadership of Washington.

To conclude, I will add a few words on the possible messages of COVID-19 to the American society.

China Bashing

Since Trump took over the power in Washington in 2016, China has been considered as a serious threat to Washington’s global domination. Washington has deployed all possible means to discredit the Chinese regime, destabilize the Chinese economy and isolate China from international decision making.

In Trump’s eyes, China bashing has very useful roles to play in the dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis in the U.S. Trump can make China the scapegoat, generate anti-China feeling and attribute Washington’s poor anti-virus policy to China. China bashing can be a good tool of covering up the policy failure.

China bashing has taken two forms.

First, Washington argues that the spread of the virus in the U.S. is due to the lack of cooperation of China in the sharing of information on the virus.

We must remember that it was December 31, 2019 when the corona -virus broke out in the city of Wuhan.

On January 3, 2020, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) was aware of the cases of pneumonia in Wuhan city.

On January 4, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported in social media the cases of the virus.

On January 6, the Chinese National Center Diseases Control and Prevention issued level-2 emergency warning.

On January 7, Xi Jinping recognized the danger of virus.

On January 8, the U.S. CDC issued a statement warning about the disease.

In the meantime, the urgent issue was whether the virus led to inter-human transmission. In fact, because of this issue, the adoption of proper measure was delayed.

This is understandable, because Chinese did not know the nature of the virus never seen before; it might have come from outside China. Finally on January 28, it was found out that the virus could be transmitted from person to person.

The U.S. was well informed about the virus directly or through the WHO.

The White House created Corona-virus Task Force on January 29 under the leadership of Alex Azar, Secretary of the HHS (Department of Health and Human Services.)

On January 30, WHO declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

On January 31, U.S. HHS declared the Public Health Emergency.

This sequence of these events shows that China provided quickly the information on the corona virus. The U.S. could have taken more proactive actions based on this information.

The U.S. argues this. If China had provided more quickly the information concerning the corona-virus, it could have prevented the pandemic in the U.S. But, in a situation where China was dealing with a mysterious disease, it was, perhaps, normal to have taken some time to know it better.

In fact, Trump was very satisfied with China’s cooperation.

On January 24, Trump said this:

“China has been working hard to control corona-virus. The United States appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work well. In particular, on behalf of American people, I want to thank President Xi Jinping.”

Thus, the U.S. was well aware of the danger of the corona-virus. And, it had ample time to prepare for the onslaught of the virus. But, for two month, the U.S. and other countries in Europe did not pro-act soon enough; this could have led to the huge backlog of infected people.

It is not clear why these countries have not pro-acted earlier. They might have thought that the virus would be confined in Asia or they might have had the over-confidence in the capacity of their public health systems to cope with the crisis.

Trump says that he cannot trust the Chinese statistical data on the number of the infected and the death. It is possible that the number of the infected and deaths looks small, given the population of China.

But, there is no way to judge the reliability of the data. For that matter, we may question the reliability of American data, too; there are reasons to suppose that the number of deaths in the U.S.is very much under estimated.

One wonders how the poor quality of Chinese data on the number of infections and deaths can prevent Washington from taking more effective anti-virus war.

Second, Trump has been trying to tell the world that the corona-virus was originated in China. Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State of the U.S. is repeating the expression ” Wuhan virus”, while Trump seems to love the expression” Chinese virus”.

The U.S. pretends that the virus was originated in China. Trump argues with no proof that the virus was leaked from a lab near the city of Wuhan.

The argument of Trump and Pompeo implies that the virus was engineered or man-made. But the U.S. Intelligence people and scientists including Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of CDC, are denying the Trump-Pompeo argument.

Furthermore, there are important papers published by authors including Asian scientists and those of the Center for Research on Globalization which claim that the virus could have been brought to China from the U.S.

What is important to point out, here, is that Washington’s argument that the virus was originated in the City of Wuhan has no proof. If there is any, it is about the time to produce it.

Of course, it is important to identify the origin of the virus. But, we should let the scientists to do the job of identifying the virus origin. The politicians should not intervene in the debate. Above all, they should not politicize and use the debate for political purpose. .

The China bashing has damaging effect on the anti-virus war. To begin with, policy makers in Washington may try to attribute their policy failure to China and this will certainly compromise the effectiveness of the anti-virus fight.

China bashing is already stirring up, in China, anti-Trump feeling; this would surely hamper the Washington-Beijing concerted efforts to fight the virus.

The U.S. needs China as much as China needs the U.S. for information, scientific research and production of medical equipments.

We are facing the common enemy of mankind; all nations should unite to kill the virus. Without the close cooperation of the two most powerful nations, it will be difficult to win the present anti-virus war, let alone the future wars against the virus that are surely coming.

There is another danger in China bashing; it is generating anti-Chinese sentiment and even anti-Asian racial discrimination, which surely hurts the global concerted efforts to fight the virus.

In fact, In San Francisco, in two weeks, in April, there were, 141 incidences of racial discrimination against Asians. The discrimination against Asians is taking place in major cities throughout the world. This is very unfortunate, for it is the time for unified cooperation of every American. Neo-liberalism and COVID-19 

The neo-liberalism is one of the factors which make the anti-virus war unusually difficult to win. The negative impact of neo-liberalism is the privatisation of the public health system on the one hand, and, on the other, the creation of the huge army of alienated low-income people who have difficulty in participating in the anti-virus fight and who are the most vulnerable targets of virus infection.

In the U.S., the neo-liberalism is the gospel of the privatization of public sector establishments. The credo underlying this gospel is the superior efficiency of private firms compared to public corporations.

Here, the issue is the definition of efficiency. In the context of neo-liberalism, it is profit. But, the value of public goods is not profit; it is the value of people’s welfare; it is the value of welfare per dollar spent.

The trouble is that once the public goods are privatized, they are no longer public goods; they don’t care about people’s welfare. One of the most important public goods in all countries is public health.

In the U.S. everything is privatized; even the prison is privatized. What is most frightening is the fact that the medical service system is privatized; there is no public health system. More than 30 million Americans have no medical insurance.

In the U.S., every medical service is profit motivated. The U.S. has the dishonour of being the nation of the most expensive medical service in the developed world.

The number of the American with no health insurance increased from 10.9% in 2016 to 13.7% in 2018.

Those who do have health insurance have to pay “co-pay” and burdensome “deductable” amounting to more than $3,300 a year in average.

The absence of a public health system means chronic shortage of hospitals, medical staff and medical equipments. For instance, the number of hospitals decreases by 30 a year; there are fewer than 45,000 intensive care units (ICU), while 2.9 million are needed.

Only 160,000 ventilators are available in addition to the federal government stock of 8,900. But, the U.S. needs millions to cope with corona-virus crisis. The situation has been improved a little lately, however.

Another credo of neo-liberalism is economic growth led by exports of goods and services. To export goods, one has to make profit. To make profit, one has to cut down the production cost. To cut down the production cost, one has to use high technology and save labour cost. To save further the labour cost, one has to develop the global value chain and exploit cheap labour and raw materials of developing countries.

The use of high technology creates unemployment or under-employment. The use of the global value chain allows the large multinational firms to make huge profit but the off-shoring of manufacturing leads to fewer jobs in developed countries. In short, one of the defects of neo-liberalism is the creation of the huge army of jobless and quasi-jobless.

The end result of neo-liberalism is the widening income gap. The popular index of the inequality of income distribution is the Gini coefficient. The higher the Gini, the wider is the income gap in favour of the higher income group. The Gini varies from zero to 100.

The present Gini of the U.S. is 50, which is level of Gini in developing countries.

This is just incredible! Remember, the U.S. is the richest country in the world, yet it is as poor as a developing country as far as the Gini is concerned.

In 2018, 1% top income group had 70% of household wealth. The bottom 50% of Americans had no income increase for thirty years. The minimum wage remains at $7.25.

The unequal income distribution combined with the absence of a public health system makes the fight against the corona-virus terribly difficult.

As we saw above, everything is in grave shortage. There are not enough hospitals, let alone the intensive care units (ICU); the number of nurses and all other health-care related human resources are in great shortage. The State governments and cities are asking Washington’s help in vain.

State governments, city governments and hospitals have to get, without much Washington’s help, needed masks, ventilators, gloves, gowns and other equipments.

Even if all these equipments are available, the great number of Americans who are jobless with no savings cannot have tests, self-isolation or social distancing.

Being poor, testing is expensive; living in crowded housing environment, social distancing is difficult; having no savings, they have to go to work, quarantine is not easy.

Leadership of Washington 

The global media seems to rightly suggest that Trump’s administration’s anti-COVID-19 fight has not been very successful, because Trump has lacked the following qualities.

Respect for science and professionals of medical and public health
Apolitical approach to the problem, transparency in handling data and the facility of government-people communication
Ability to coordinate sectional and regional anti-corona-virus efforts
Ability of mobilizing the general public’s participation in the anti-virus fight
Respect for science and professionals of medical and public health

One of the key features of daily briefing of the White House is President Trump’s lack of respect for the advice of medical science and public health experts; he often makes his personal views with no scientific or professional backing.

This attitude might have delayed the whole process of anti-virus war. As early as January-February, 2020, Trump was warned six times (January 8, 25, 30 and February 21, 23 and 25) by his close advisors about the propagation of the COVID-19.

However, Trump did not take the advice seriously for some reasons. He was quoted to have said that experts had told him that the virus would not touch the U.S. One wonders on what ground his advisors would have so advised.

Finally as late as March 13, Trump declared the National Emergency and timidly started to “re-act” not “pro-act”.

In other words, Trump lost a whole month before reacting. In the case COVID-19, one month is terribly long period of time. Nobody knows how many people in the U.S. were already infected.

In the literature on epidemic diseases, there is the coefficient R0 (reproduction ratio) which is the multiplier of virus propagation.

If triple-day coefficient R0is 3, it means that the number of the infected triples every three days. On the first day there is one person infected. On the third day, there will be 3 persons infected; on the sixth day, 9 persons; on the ninth day, 27 persons; on the twelfth day, there will be 81 persons infected.

If we have 100 persons infected on day one, in 12 days we will have 8,100 infected.

Thus R0is a very important indicator of the extent of the virus propagation. For instance, if R0is 5.7, no less than 82% of the population must be immunized. It is estimated that the multiplier for COVID-19 is about 3.

There is no doubt that a very large number of persons in the U.S. could have been infected due to the delayed reaction of the federal government.

Politicization of the Anti-Virus War

One thing a national leader should not do, during the urgent pandemic crisis, is the temptation to find a balance among various conflicting interests.

The big business may want to delay the knockdown because of the fear of losing profit caused by the lockdown.

Trump may want to maximize his political TV exposure in order to win the presidential election.

Religious leaders may ask Trump to let open the church during the crisis for religious and fiAnonymouscial reasons.

The search for a balance among these different interests is the best way to speed up the propagation of the virus. In the fight against the virus, each minute counts. In the anti-virus war, the saving of lives should be given the top national priority.

It is understandable that the government wishes to ease lockdowns and social distancing to recover the shrinking economy and help skyrocketing jobless.

But, the timing is important. If it is too soon, there will another onslaught of the virus. On the other hand, if it is too late, the economy will be further destroyed.

Each country should choose the timing and the extent of easing in function of the cost acceptable by the people.

However, the saving of lives should have the priority, because the lost lives cannot be restored, while the broken economy can be recovered.

Another unpleasant picture of the briefing is the arrogant attitude of Trump toward reporters. He is reported to ask the reporters to praise his deeds before asking questions; this is surely politically motivated. When the reporters ask the data or proof of his claims, he shows even hostility toward the reporters. He is not transparent; he often contradicts himself.

Poor Coordination of Anti-Virus war Efforts 

There are fifty states and a number of metropolitan cities in the U.S. The corona-virus ignores the state demarcation borders; it likes to travel from one place to another. Therefore, the only way to win over the virus is to have unified approach of all states and all cities.

So, we need one single central authority which should coordinate the anti-virus efforts of states and cities. Such authority is the federal government.

The federal government must coordinate the whole process of anti-virus war beginning from the identification of the infected to the stage of healing the infected.

The access to medical equipment can vary from state to state and from city to city depending upon the fiAnonymouscial capacity of states and cities on the on hand, and, on the other, the condition of virus propagation.

Unfortunately, there is no real coordination by the federal government. At present time, there is no Washington’s real coordination of testing, lockdown, hospitalization and the curing of the infected, the production and the distribution of medical equipments.

What is alarming is this. In the absence of a unified policy, in some states, golf clubs remain open. In some other states, there is no effective social distancing or lockdown.

The federal government’s coordination is so bad that the governor of New York State, Andrew Cuomo is proposing a creation of regional inter-state coordination of anti-virus fight for the North-Eastern region. So is the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, for the South-Western Region. But, they still need the federal coordination of the inter-State efforts of coordination.

People’s Voluntary Participation in the Anti-virus Fight

One of the qualities of the national leader in time of crisis is the mobilization of the people for the unified efforts to handle the crisis; this is the necessary condition for the success in the fight. To beat the virus, people should be united.

But, the U.S is perhaps one of the most divided countries in the world. The American culture is essentially based on the competition in all fields of human activities.

It is a country where the strong rules over the weak, where the rich is indifferent to the poor and where the skin colour determines the social hierarchy. In this situation, the marginalisation and the alienation of people become a challenging social problem.

The sad thing is that under the neo-liberalism, the marginal group has become more marginal; the alienated people have become more alienated.

Under such conditions, it is very difficult to expect to see the unified cooperation of the people for the fight against the virus. Indeed, there are signs that the people do not respect the guidelines put out by the federal government.

It is just unbelievable to see that so many people make a mockery of the government instruction on self-quarantine and social distancing. In some states, heavily armed crowds protest the government’s guidelines. This shows how little the people do have confidence in the federal government.

Lessons of the Corona-virus Crisis to the American Society 

One thing sure is that for all these reasons, it will be difficult to prevent further propagation of the virus in the U.S. Nonetheless, one day, it will be over. But what lesson can we learn from the corona-virus crisis?

If there is any lesson to learn from this crisis, it is the crying need for major investments for people’s security. America has been investing heavily for military security and world supremacy. Regrettably, this policy has resulted in the negligence of other kinds of security, namely, income security, physical security and public health security.

The income security in the U.S. is in bad situation, in very bad situation. As we saw above, the U.S. is suffering from unjust income distribution. The lack of income security for the people is not only unjust but also it could lead to decades-long economic stagnation, as it has happened in Japan.

Another terrible phenomenon in America is poor physical security, let alone psychological security. In fact, the American society is the most dangerous society among the developed countries. The number of mass killings is 415 a year, or 1.13 a day. In 2019, as many as 39,052 were killed by gun violence; the number of guns per capita is 1.25.

The preparation of the public health security in the U.S. is urgent, because the next global pandemic of virus will surely come. As far as the public health is concerned, Americans should free themselves from the god of neo-liberalism which has destroyed public health.

These three kinds of security is something which even a poor country tries hard to assure. But, it is just incredible that a country where the per capita GDP is $65,000 does not seem trying hard to provide. So, we ask why?

The sad answer is the massive investments in military muscles. The annual national defence budget is more than $ 738 billion in 2020 as against mere $260 billion in China. No less than three quarter of the “discretionary budget” goes to the military.

Washington justifies heavy military investment and dozens of wars carried out since WWII in the name of the national defence security. But are these wars necessary? The wars are justified, if there are enemies which threaten the U.S.

Is there any country which can be a real threat to the U.S.? Even China cannot be a military threat, because China does not want war with the U.S.; its GDP is caching up, but, as far as the per capita GDP is concerned, it is still a near middle-income country. Besides, China wishes to live in a peaceful global order.

It is hoped that once this virus crisis is over, the Americans should persuade their government to cut down the military spending and heavily invest for the assurance of income security, physical security and public health security.

History shows us that any major changes in the society are not done by the politicians alone because of their interconnected political and fiAnonymouscial interests; only the ordinary people can do itunder a real leader. We have seen it in South Korea.",1,
377,Max Schachmann triumphs at Paris-Nice as Nairo Quintana takes final stage | Sport | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/luke-mclaughlin,"The German cyclist Max Schachmann, of BORA-hansgrohe, sealed overall victory in Paris-Nice on Saturday as the Colombian Nairo Quintana won the seventh and final stage in Valdeblore-La Colmiane. Schachmann held a 36-second lead going into what became the final day, after the coronavirus outbreak led to the cancellation of Sundayâ€™s scheduled eighth stage, and he was pushed to the limit in pursuit of the title. Tiesj Benootâ€™s dramatic late attack for Team Sunweb inside the last kilometre of the punishing 16km final ascent forced his GC rival Schachmann to respond from a chasing group also featuring Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) and Vincenzo Nibali (Trek-Segafredo). But the Belgian Benoot ended second both on the stage and in the overall race, eventually reducing his arrears in the general classification to 18 seconds. Schachmann, who collapsed in exhaustion after the finish line, had led the week-long race from start to finish after securing an impressive victory on the first stage in Plaisir. Thomas de Gendt (Lotto Soudal) had earlier launched a trademark solo bid for final-stage glory after a breakaway group that featured some big hitters such as Romain Bardet (AG2R-La Mondiale), Alberto Bettiol (EF Pro Cycling) and Quintana (Arkea Samsic) was whittled down to just two: De Gendt and Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-Quick-Step). De Gendt dropped his French rival inside the final 15km as he went for broke but was then reeled in by Quintanaâ€™s powerful attack which came less than five kilometres from the finish on the long final climb. Quintana passed the breakaway specialist De Gendt and won the stage by 47 seconds with Pinot coming home third, 56 seconds back. Schachmann said: â€œIt was very, very hard. The last three kilometers were a walk through hell, through pain. Now itâ€™s like being in heaven and it erases all the pain in my legs. â€œItâ€™s not my first success but the biggest so far and the most important because a whole lot of people doubted that I could be a GC rider,â€ Schachmann said. â€œNow I won the most prestigious one-week race.â€ Quintana, who has been in eye-catching recent form having already recorded victories at the Tour de la Provence and Tour des Alpes, said: â€œI always try to win stages with some elegance. I wanted to win [a stage] to bring a little joy to this team, and this is a gift for the whole team for the job done. Now Iâ€™m going to go back to Colombia to stay with my family.â€ As top-level sports were postponed across the globe on Friday, race organisers had announced their decision to scrap the final stage but conclude the race with no fans permitted at the start and finish areas. That decision followed the French governmentâ€™s move to ban gatherings of more than 100 people in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Several high-profile teams such as Team Ineos, Mitchelton-SCOTT and Astana Pro Team had withdrawn before the race began. Along with every other sport, the future of the professional cycling season is clouded in uncertainty. The Giro dâ€™Italia has already been postponed, along with a number of the Spring classics including E3 Harelbeke and Gent-Wevelgem. The Tour of Flanders, one of the biggest one-day races on the calendar, is scheduled for 5 April and, as things stand, could in theory go ahead, with all professional sport in Belgium called off until only 31 March.",0,
384,China may keep 'abundant' liquidity to cushion virus impact: BlackRock,Eustance Huang@EustanceHuang,"China will likely seek to keep ""abundant"" liquidity in the country as it continues to grapple with the economic impact of a coronavirus outbreak, according to the world's largest investment firm BlackRock. ""I think from a measures perspective, I don't think we have seen all of it as yet,"" Neeraj Seth, head of Asian credit at BlackRock, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday. The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has already killed more than 2,000 people and infected more than 74,000 others, most of them from China. It has also spread to more than two dozen countries and has triggered sell-offs in some financial markets and prompted a few governments to downgrade their economic outlook. Seth's comments came before China cut its loan prime rate (LPR) on Thursday morning, a move that could lower borrowing costs for businesses. In a widely expected move, the People's Bank of China on Thursday cut its 1-year LPR by 10 basis points, while the 5-year LPR saw a 5 basis points reduction. The announcement came days after the People's Bank of China reduced the . The LPR is the interest rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers. In August last year, the Chinese central bank changed the way commercial lenders set interest rates for loans. The coronavirus outbreak in China has delayed the return of operations in factories following an extended Lunar New Year holiday. It has also raised concerns over its potential economic impact, both domestically as well as internationally. Earlier this week, Apple warned it did not expect to meet its second-quarter forecast for revenue, and cited lower iPhone supply globally as well as lower Chinese demand due to the outbreak. Questions remain over how the credit flows into the system, Seth said. This is especially so for small and medium businesses that are feeling the pressure, he added. ""A lot of these factories have been shut for more than a month, they probably still remain at a low utilization rate for (a) coming month or two."" Beyond that, Seth said Beijing is expected to show more ""fiscal impulse."" ""We do expect to see a combination of the monetary and the fiscal policy coming together to support the economy. To some extent, the fiscal impulse is going to be a function of how much of downside risk is there which is still uncertain to some extent given we're still in the middle of it,"" he said. Asked about the potential magnitude of the fiscal measures that China could take, Seth said it will likely be ""more measured"" compared to the spending that was made following the 2008 global financial crisis. China's economy today is much bigger than it was back then, he said, adding that the total debt in the system has also gone up significantly. That means the cost of servicing that debt would be ""quite high as a percentage of GDP."" â€” CNBC's Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.",0,
237,"New Evidence Shows Wearing Face Mask Can Help Coronavirus Enter the Brain and Pose More Health Risk, Warn Expert",Staff Reporter,"Dr. Russell Blaylock, a retired U.S. neurosurgeon and author, cautions that face masks cannot entirely protect you from getting sick and catching pathogens. He adds that it can also pose a serious health risk for wearers. He stresses that only ill people should wear face masks. Since the coronavirus pandemic started, people everywhere have been wearing protective equipment such as face masks, face shields, and gloves. Wearing gloves in public places such as the grocery had been previously debunked as 'unhelpful' or possibly harmful, especially if not used properly. 
Are Face Masks Effective Against COVID-19?
The Cleveland Clinic says that gloves do not provide immunity from viruses, and it doesn't permit you to touch everything within reach. Furthermore, germs that come in contact with your gloves could be transferred to all the other surfaces you touch. 
Now, even face masks face the same critique as Dr. Blaylock says that exhaled viruses would not be given a chance to escape if wearing a mask. He says that the virus would further concentrate and circulate within the nasal passages and could eventually travel into the brain. 
According to Dr. Blaylock, there have been no studies conducted to establish that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has an impact on the transmission of the coronavirus. It was not until recently that the Commission on Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidelines for wearing face masks. 
Previously, they only advised sick people to wear protective masks, but now they encourage everyone to wear them when out in public since it has been found out that some could be asymptomatic carriers of the virus. The CDC also has guidelines for wearing cloth masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Harmful Effects of Wearing a Face Mask
Aside from the lack of scientific evidence pointing to requiring the use of a face mask for preventive measures, several studies have explored the dangers of wearing a face mask, especially for long periods.
These dangers include increased airway resistance, accumulation of carbon dioxide, hypoxia or inadequate oxygen supply, headaches, and even other life-threatening complications. 
In a study conducted by the National Taiwan University Hospital, it has been found that the use of N-95 masks in healthcare workers has caused them to experience hypoxemia, the low level of oxygen in the blood, and hypercapnia, an elevation in the blood's carbon dioxide levels. 
Another study reported findings of headache in health professionals using the same protective face mask. Similarly, pregnant women wearing N-95 masks were also found to have breathing difficulties associated with the use of the mask. 
Researchers suggest that the benefits of using N95 masks to prevent contraction of infectious diseases should be weighed against possible respiratory consequences linked with extended use of N95 masks. Newer evidence also reveals that the coronavirus may enter the brain in some cases. By wearing a mask, viruses released upon expiration will not be given a chance to escape and will further congregate in the nasal passages. This allows the virus to enter the olfactory nerves and travel further, eventually reaching the brain.
Dr. Blaylock says that one should not attack or criticize healthy people who do not wear masks, as studies point out that it may be a wise choice after all.",1,
381,Australians urged to adopt phone tracking app in coronavirus fight - Reuters,"Byron Kaye, Colin Packham","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians were strongly urged to sign up for a controversial mobile phone app that will track their movements as officials warned on Friday that public life could be constrained for another year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said downloading the smartphone software, which has been criticised by civil liberties groups as an invasion of privacy, would initially be voluntary. However, he declined to rule out making use of the â€œTraceTogetherâ€ app compulsory, stressing the ability to detect potential new outbreaks would be a key part of giving officials the confidence to begin winding back strict â€œsocial distancingâ€ measures. â€œI will be calling on Australians to do it, frankly, as a matter of national service,â€ Morrison told radio station Triple M. â€œThis would be something they might not normally do in an ordinary time, but this is not an ordinary time. If you download this app, youâ€™ll be helping to save someoneâ€™s life.â€ The government is planning to roll out the app within the next two weeks after finalising legal issues around privacy, Morrison said. Australia has so far avoided the high numbers of coronavirus casualties reported around the world after closing its borders and imposing restrictions on public movement. Restaurants, bars and other â€œnon-essentialâ€ businesses have closed and public gatherings of more than two people are banned under the threat of fines and even prison, measures that are expected to double the unemployment rate by mid-year. The daily growth rate of reported new infections has steadied in the low percentage single digits, or fewer than 50 per day, from about 25% several weeks ago. The countryâ€™s most populous states reported 43 new cases on Friday, taking the total to 6,522, while the death toll rose by two to 65. Morrison said this week that all social distancing measures will remain in place for at least another four weeks, and some would likely remain for up to a year. Any easing of the current limitations would not occur until Australia had increased testing capacity, strengthened contact tracing and readied local responses for further outbreaks, he said. The smartphone app would be key to improving contact tracing by detecting whether people had spent more than 15 minutes with others who may have been infected. Australiaâ€™s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said at least 40% of people would need to be signed up to make it effective. The TraceTogether app has been available in Singapore since March 20, but its success has been limited with less than one in five downloading the app, the city stateâ€™s government said earlier this month. Officials in the countryâ€™s most populous state, New South Wales, on Thursday said they were considering imposing an ongoing roster system for children to return to school after the current Easter vacation. Schools have been a source of division between the federal government, which has urged them to reopen, and the states and territories, which are responsible for their governance. Morrison has cited data showing the low risk of transmission posed by children, while state officials are dealing with a backlash from parents and teachers concerned about exposure to the virus. â€œWe are considering our options around a rostering system which will have some students go back on a particular day to increase that level of face-to-face,â€ New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters. â€œThe alternative is that unfortunately students could face up to a year or longer at home and we donâ€™t think thatâ€™s appropriate.â€ For universities, which rely on fees from international students, the international border closure could cost them as much as A$19 billion ($12.09 billion), Victoria University said in an analysis released on Friday, forecasting a further A$38 billion hit to the broader economy. In the neighbouring Pacific islands, Papua New Guinea Prime (PNG) Minister James Marape said he has been tested for COVID-19 after exposure to an infected employee at the countryâ€™s emergency operations centre. PNG has also introduced lockdown measures, including a nightly curfew, a ban on all public gatherings, the closure of public transport and the prohibition of the sale of alcohol, Marape said in an emailed statement.

241,"Manufactured Pandemic: Testing People for Any Strain of a Coronavirus, Not Specifically for COVID-19",Julian Rose,"I work in the healthcare field. Here’s the problem, we are testing people for any strain of a Coronavirus. Not specifically for COVID-19. There are no reliable tests for a specific COVID-19 virus. There are no reliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual COVID-19 virus cases. This needs to be addressed first and foremost. Every action and reaction to COVID-19 is based on totally flawed data and we simply can not make accurate assessments.
This is why you’re hearing that most people with COVID-19 are showing nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. That’s because most Coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. The few actual novel Coronavirus cases do have some worse respiratory responses, but still have a very promising recovery rate, especially for those without prior issues.
The ‘gold standard’ in testing for COVID-19 is laboratory isolated/purified coronavirus particles free from any contaminants and particles that look like viruses but are not, that have been proven to be the cause of the syndrome known as COVID-19 and obtained by using proper viral isolation methods and controls (not the PCR that is currently being used or Serology /antibody tests which do not detect virus as such). PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for ‘viral sequences’, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome.
The problem is the test is known not to work.
It uses ‘amplification’ which means taking a very very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analyzed. Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery.
Additionally, it’s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues. The Mickey Mouse test kits being sent out to hospitals, at best, tell analysts you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. It may tell you the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus – say the huge family of coronavirus. But that’s all. The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.
And that’s not even getting into the other issue – viral load.
If you remember the PCR works by amplifying minute amounts of DNA. It therefore is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that’s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a few virus kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you you need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can’t determine if a osteogenesis is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.
If you feel sick and get a PCR test any random virus DNA might be identified even if they aren’t at all involved in your sickness which leads to false diagnosis.
And coronavirus are incredibly common. A large percentage of the world human population will have covi DNA in them in small quantities even if they are perfectly well or sick with some other pathogen.
Do you see where this is going yet? If you want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic – pick a coronavirus.
They are incredibly common and there’s tons of them. A very high percentage of people who have become sick by other means (flu, bacterial pneumonia, anything) will have a positive
PCR test for covi even if you’re doing them properly and ruling out contamination, simply because covis are so common.
There are hundreds of thousands of flu and pneumonia victims in hospitals throughout the world at any one time. All you need to do is select the sickest of these in a single location – say Wuhan – administer PCR tests to them and claim anyone showing viral sequences similar to a coronavirus (which will inevitably be quite a few) is suffering from a ‘new’ disease.
Since you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will go on to die.
You can then say this ‘new’ virus has a CFR higher than the flu and use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more ‘cases’, which expands the testing, which produces yet more ‘cases’ and so on and so on.
Before long you have your ‘pandemic’, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick to convert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn’t actually exist.
Now just run the same scam in other countries. Making sure to keep the fear message running high so that people will feel panicky and less able to think critically.
Your only problem is going to be that – due to the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen but just regular sick people, you are mislabeling your case numbers, and especially your deaths, are going to be way too low for a real new deadly virus pandemic.
But you can stop people pointing this out in several ways.
1. You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then claim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.
2. You can tell people that ‘minimizing’ the dangers is irresponsible and bully them into not talking about numbers.
3. You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.
4. You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds of coronavirus DNA in them) and thus inflate your ‘case figures’ with ‘asymptomatic carriers’ (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologist knows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen.
Take these 4 simple steps and you can have your own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running in weeks.
They can not “confirm” something for which there is no accurate test.",1,
108,WE ARE ALL CONNECTED' Bill Gates says coronavirus reminds us we are all equal in powerful open letter,Samantha Lock,"MICROSOFT founder Bill Gates has released a powerful message about what we can learn from the Coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe.
As of Monday, the disease has killed more than 16,000 people worldwide and around 370,000 have been infected. But multi-billionaire Gates, 64 - who donated £85 million to combat the virus last month - believes that despite the chaos, there is 'a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens'.
In an open letter, entitled 'What is the Corona/ Covid-19 Virus Really Teaching us?', he wrote:
'A SPIRITUAL PURPOSE'
""I’m a strong believer that there is a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens, whether that is what we perceive as being good or being bad.
""As I meditate upon this, I want to share with you what I feel the Corona/ Covid-19 virus is really doing to us.
1) It is reminding us that we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, fiAnonymouscial situation or how famous we are. This disease treats us all equally, perhaps we should to.
If you don’t believe me, just ask Tom Hanks.
2) It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another.
It is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport.
It is reminding us, by oppressing us for a short time, of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression.
3) It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals.
If we don’t look after our health, we will, of course, get sick.
4) It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do, which is to help each other, especially those who are old or sick.
Our purpose is not to buy toilet roll.
5) It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it’s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to.
6) It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this.
It is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and to strengthen our family unit.
'OUR TRUE WORK'
7) It is reminding us that our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do.
Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another.
8) It is reminding us to keep our egos in check.
It is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are, a virus can bring our world to a standstill.
9) It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands.
We can choose to cooperate and help each other, to share, to give, to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish, to hoard, to look after only our self.
Indeed, it is difficulties that bring out our true colours.
10) It is reminding us that we can be patient, or we can panic.
We can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass, or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and, consequently, cause ourselves more harm than good.
11) It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning.
This can be a time of reflection and understanding, where we learn from our mistakes, or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to.
12) It is reminding us that this Earth is sick.
It is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick.
13) It is reminding us that after every difficulty, there is always ease.
Life is cyclical, and this is just a phase in this great cycle. We do not need to panic; this too shall pass.
14) Whereas many see the Corona/ Covid-19 virus as a great disaster, I prefer to see it as a *great corrector*
It is sent to remind us of the important lessons that we seem to have forgotten and it is up to us if we will learn them or not.",1,

200,Is Coronavirus Contagious?,Sally Fallon Morell,"This is the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question. The premise that coronavirus is highly contagious and can cause disease provides the justification for putting entire nations on lockdown, destroying the global economy and throwing hundreds of thousands out of work. But is it contagious? Does it even cause disease?


As early as 1799, researchers puzzled over the cause of influenza, which appeared suddenly, often in diverse places at the same time, and could not be explained by any theory of contagion. In 1836, Heinrich Schweich, author of a book on influenza, noted that all physiological processes produce electricity and offered the theory that an electrical disturbance of the atmosphere may prevent the body from discharging it. He repeated the then-common belief that the accumulation of electricity in the body causes the symptoms of influenza and that outbreaks were due to atmospheric “influences”—hence the name influenza.

Now that we know about the electrical nature of the sun, we can make some interesting observations. The years 1645-1715 was a period that astronomers call the Maunder minimum, when the sun was very quiet; astronomers observed no sunspots during the time span and the northern lights were nonexistent; then in 1715, sunspots reappeared, as did the northern lights. Sunspot activity then increased, reaching a high in 1727, and in 1728, influenza appeared in waves on every continent. Sunspot activities became more violent until they peaked in1738 when physicians reported flu in both man and animals, including dogs, horses and birds, especially sparrows. By some estimates, two million people perished during the ten-year pandemic.

These and other facts about the relationship of influenza to disturbances in electricity come from a remarkable book, The Invisible Rainbow, by Arthur Firstenberg. Firstenberg chronicles the history of electricity in the U.S. and throughout the world, and the outbreaks of illness that accompanied each step towards greater electrification. The first stage involved the installation of telegraph lines—by 1875, these formed a spider web over the whole earth totaling seven hundred thousand miles, with enough copper wire to encircle the globe almost thirty times.

With it came a new disease called neurasthenia. Outside of the U.S., scientists recognized electricity as one of its causes. Like those suffering today from “chronic fatigue,” patients felt weak and exhausted, unable to concentrate. They had headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, floaters in the eyes, racing pulse, pains in the heart region and palpitations; they were depressed and had anxiety attacks. Dr. George Miller Beard noted that the disease spread along the routes of railroads and telegraph lines; it often resembled the common cold or influenza and commonly seized people in the prime of life.

1889 marks the beginning of the modern electrical era and also of a deadly flu pandemic, which followed the advent of electricity throughout the globe. Says Firstenberg, “Influenza struck explosively and unpredictably, over and over in waves until early 1894. It was as if something fundamental had changed in the atmosphere. . .”

Physicians puzzled over influenza’s capricious spread. For example, William Beveridge, author of a 1975 textbook on influenza, noted “The English warship Arachne was cruising off the coast of Cuba ‘without any contact with land. No less than 114 men out of a crew of 149 fell ill with influenza and only later was it learnt that there had been outbreaks in Cuba at the same time.”

During the first world war, governments on both sides of the conflict installed antennas which eventually blanketed the earth with strong radio signals–and during the later part of 1918, disaster struck. The Spanish flu afflicted a third of the world’s population and killed around fifty million people, more than the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Those living on military bases, where the antennas were routinely installed, were the most vulnerable. A common symptom was bleeding—from the nostrils, the gums, ears, skin, stomach, intestines, uterus, kidneys and brain. Many died of hemorrhage in the lungs, the victims literally drowning in their own blood. Tests revealed a decreased ability for the blood to coagulate. Health officials in those days were very interested in the question of whether the Spanish flu was contagious. Doctors from the U.S. Public Health Service tried to infect one hundred healthy volunteers between the ages of eighteen and twenty- five by collecting mucous secretions from the noses, throats and upper respiratory tracts of those who were sick. They transferred these secretions to the noses, mouths and lungs of the volunteers, but not one of them got sick; blood of sick donors was injected into the blood of the volunteers, but they remained stubbornly healthy; finally they instructed those afflicted to breathe and cough over the volunteers, but none became sick. Researchers even tried to infect healthy horses with the mucous secretions of horses with the flu, but the results were the same. The Spanish flu was not contagious.

The year 1957 marked the installation of radar worldwide. The “Asian” influenza pandemic began in February 1957 and lasted for a year. A decade later the U.S. launched twenty-eight satellites into the Van Allen belts as part of the Initial Defense Communication Satellite Program (IDCSP), ushering in the “Hong Kong” flu pandemic, which began in July 1968.

As Firstenberg observes, “In each case—in 1889, 1918, 1957 and 1968—the electrical envelope of the earth. . . was suddenly and profoundly disturbed,” and along with it the electrical circuits in the human body. Western medicine pays scant attention to the electrical nature of living things—plants, animals and humans—but mountains of evidence indicate that faint currents govern everything that happens in the body to keep us alive and healthy. From the coagulation of the blood, to energy production in the mitochondria, even to small amounts of copper in the bones, which create currents for the mainteAnonymousce of bone structure—all can be influenced by the presence of electricity in the atmosphere, especially “dirty” electricity, characterized by many overlapping frequencies and jagged changes in frequency and voltage. Today we know that each cell in the body has its own electrical grid, maintained by the highly structured water inside the cell membrane. Cancer occurs when this structure breaks down, and cancer has increased with each new development in the electrification of the earth.

Chinese medicine has long recognized the electrical nature of the human body and has developed a system to defuse the “accumulation of electricity” that leads to disease. It’s called acupuncture. Many things that we do instinctively also help release any unhealthy buildup of current—the mother who strokes her infant’s head or who scratches her children’s backs to put them to sleep, the caresses of lovers, walking barefoot, massage, even handshakes and hugs—all now discouraged by the frowny faces of health authorities as we face the specter of bed police bursting in at midnight to make sure that Dad is sleeping on the sofa.

Am I making this up? The Washington Post recently published an article in which a mother was explaining to her teenage son why she couldn’t hug him during quarantine; and a WHO official suggests that public health officials should enter people’s homes and “in a dignified way” remove those who test positive, to prevent infecting the rest of the family.

Fast forward to the Internet and cell phone era. According to Firstenberg, the onset of cell phone service in 1996 resulted in greater levels of mortality in major cities like Los Angeles, New York, San Diego and Boston. Over the years wireless signals at multiple frequencies have filled the atmosphere to a greater and greater extent, along with mysterious outbreaks like SARS and MERS. Today we face the installation of fifth generation wireless (5G), broadcast in the gigahertz range, often at 60 gigahertz, a frequency that is highly absorbed by oxygen, causing the O2 molecule to split apart, making it useless for respiration

Compare the pattern of 5G installation in the top map to the pattern of corona virus cases in the lower map. While correlation does not prove causation, the strong overlap between 5G rollout locations and corona virus cases should give one pause, especially given the history of pandemics following step changes in planetary electrification. On September 26, 2019, 5G wireless was turned on in Wuhan, China and also launched in parts of New York City (areas of uptown, midtown and downtown Manhattan, along with parts of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens), the difference being that the 5G grid in Wuhan was much denser, with about ten thousand antennas—more antennas than exist in the whole U.S.A., all concentrated in one city. Illness has followed 5G installation in South Korea, Italy and Iran. In South America, Ecuador is a hot spot for the respiratory illness, and it is in Ecuador that 5G first appeared. The 5G system is also installed on modern cruise ships and in many health care facilities. People who suffer from electrical sensitivity cannot go near many hospitals and nursing homes.

But surely this is just a coincidence.  Isn’t it a virus that is causing the current outbreak? Doesn’t this nasty little creature called coronavirus infect us and make us sick? Please watch this talk by Dr. Andrew Kaufman in which he explains the role of exosomes in the cells.

Exosomes are particles released from the cell; they carry RNA, toxins and cellular debris in response to various insults (toxins, stress including fear, cancer, ionizing radiation, infection, injury, many diseases, immune response and asthma). A number of virologists agree with his conclusions that viruses are exosomes; they are the same size, the same shape, both carry RNA and both attach to the same receptors. These exosomes/viruses are the result and not the cause of illness, with primary roles of coagulation, intercellular signaling and excretion of waste materials. If 5G, by overloading the body’s electrical circuitry and by high-jacking oxygen, causes injury to the lung cells, then an increased production of exosomes (wrongly called viruses) is sure to be the result—and thank goodness!

No wonder the anti-viral medications—given in the early days of the pandemic, but now abandoned—caused such terrible side effects (allergic reactions, fever, nausea, vomiting, bleeding, diabetic lactic acidosis, damage to the kidney, liver and pancreas. . . and breathing problems). These drugs suppress the body’s efforts to protect itself against the poisonous effects of 5G and other toxins.

If you do a bit of surfing on the Internet, you will find that exosomes are the latest thing for diagnosis and therapy, with many medical uses—from cancer treatment, to wound healing, to hair restoration!

It’s clear that we are making the same mistake with viruses that we have made with cholesterol and saturated fat—blaming a substance that is essential to life for causing disease. Just twenty years ago the medical profession “knew” that bacteria were killers—now we recognize that bacteria are essential to health. How long will it take us to learn that so-called viruses are our friends?

It’s interesting to note that each wave of influenza has its own constellation of symptoms—during the Spanish flu epidemic the main problem was bleeding, the inability of the blood to coagulate; the main victims were healthy people in the prime of life, between the ages of twenty-five and forty. Today’s victims are older, usually with pre-existing conditions. The main symptom of today’s outbreak seems to be hypoxia, akin to high altitude sickness.

Please watch this video by Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell, working on the front lines in New York City. Says Kyle-Sidell, “We’ve never seen anything like it!” The afflicted are literally gasping for air. In fact, the ventilators that the hospitals have scrambled to obtain do more harm than good and may be accounting for the high mortality rate. These patients don’t need help breathing—they need more oxygen when they take a breath. This is not the sign of a contagious disease but of a disruption of our mechanisms for producing energy and getting oxygen to the red blood cells.

So is corona virus a contagious bad guy? Remember that researchers could not show that the dreadful Spanish flu was contagious. The fact that viruses are actually helpful exosomes, and that many who test positive are symptom-free, makes their role as a perpetrator highly unlikely.  To settle this question once and for all, we need to do the same contagion studies that proved non-contagion in 1918.  I’d be happy to be the first volunteer.",1,

1,Overhyped Coronavirus Weaponized Against Trump,Rush Limbaugh,"RUSH: Folks, this coronavirus thing, I want to try to put this in perspective for you. It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus. (interruption) You think I’m wrong about this? You think I’m missing it by saying that’s… (interruption) Yeah, I’m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks. The Drive-By Media hype of this thing as a pandemic, as the Andromeda strain, as, “Oh, my God, if you get it, you’re dead.” Do you know what the — I think the survival rate is 98%. Ninety-eight percent of people get the coronavirus survive. It’s a respiratory system virus. It probably is a ChiCom laboratory experiment that is in the process of being weaponized. All superpower nations weaponize bioweapons. They experiment with them. The Russians, for example, have weaponized fentanyl. Now, fentanyl is also not what it is represented to be. If you watch cop shows, then you probably… Stick with me on this. If you watch cop shows, you probably believe that just the dust from a package of fentanyl can kill you if you’re in the same room with it. Not true. Not true. Even the cheap kind of fentanyl coming from China that’s used to spike heroin… They use fentanyl ’cause it’s cheap. It gives a quick hit, doesn’t last very long, which is really cool if you’re trying to addict people. But it doesn’t kill people the way it’s projected on TV. It can if you OD on it. But inhaling a little fentanyl dust is not going to cause you to lose consciousness and stop breathing as they depict on cop shows. It’s dangerous. Don’t misunderstand. But it isn’t the way it’s portrayed in popular criminal TV shows, cop shows, and so forth and so on. The coronavirus is the same. It’s really being hyped as a deadly Andromeda Strain or Ebola pandemic that, “Oh, my God, is going to wipe out the nation. It’s going to wipe out the population of the world.” The stock market’s down like 900 points right now. The survival rate of this is 98%! You have to read very deeply to find that number, that 2% of the people get the coronavirus die. That’s less than the flu, folks. That is a far lower death statistic than any form of influenza, which is an annual thing that everybody gets shots for. There’s nothing unusual about the coronavirus. In fact, coronavirus is not something new. There are all kinds of viruses that have that name. Now, do not misunderstand. I’m not trying to get you to let your guard down. Nobody wants to get any of this stuff. I mean, you never… I hate getting the common cold. You don’t want to get the flu. It’s miserable. But we’re not talking about something here that’s gonna wipe out your town or your city if it finds its way there. This is a classic illustration of how media coverage works. Even if this media coverage isn’t stacked, even if this is just the way media normally does things, this is a hyped, panic-filled version. It’s exactly how the media deals with these things to create audience, readership, interest, clicks, what have you. It originated in China in a little — well, not a little town. It’s a town that is 11 million people, Wuhan, China. One of the reasons they’re able to hype this is that the doctor what warned everybody about it came down with it and died. So if a doctor got it, “Oh, my God, Rush! A doctor got it? You can’t possibly be right if a doctor can’t protect himself.” He didn’t know what he was dealing with. He discovered it back in December. I’m telling you, the ChiComs are trying to weaponize this thing. Here’s the story on Russians and fentanyl. Fentanyl is a very, very powerful opiate — and for those of you that haven’t had any experience with opiates, the people that get addicted to ’em take them and they get very euphoric. They kill pain. They do wonderful things. But they make you very, very euphoric. They act like speed. Other people take ’em, and they hate ’em. It makes ’em vomit, throw up, feel nauseous. It doesn’t do anything for ’em. They’re never gonna get addicted. So in Moscow the Chechens, way back… I’m gonna go back now — what is it — maybe 10 years or longer. A bunch of Chechen rebels took over an opera house and had a bunch of Russian hostages in there and made all kinds of threats — and Putin, unbeknownst to anybody, had weaponized fentanyl. He’d turned it into a gas, an invisible gas. He just put it in the ventilation system of this opera house or whatever it was (I’m giving you the sketchy, short version of this) and everybody in there fell asleep and died. You know, in a drug overdose, you stop breathing. That’s what… It slows down your respiratory system so much that you stop breathing. That’s what an OD is, and everybody in that place, including the Chechens — Pfft! — had no idea what happened to ’em. It’s not violent. You just fall asleep for unknown reasons at the amounts that Putin weaponized and put in there. If you take a normal dose of fentanyl that you get from a doctor in a hospital, it’s not gonna kill you, obviously. But the amount they weaponized — and up to this time, nobody had ever weaponized fentanyl. Nobody had ever made it into an invisible, odorless, colorless gas, until it was discovered that the Russians had done it. Well, every nation is working on things like this, and the ChiComs obviously in their lab are doing something here with the coronavirus — and it got out. Some people believe it got out on purpose, that the ChiComs have a whole lot of problems based on an economy that cannot provide for the number of people they have. So losing a few people here or there is not so bad for the Chinese government. There could be anything to explain this. But the way it’s being used… I believe the way it’s being weaponized is by virtue of the media, and I think that it is an effort to bring down Trump, and one of the ways it’s being used to do this is to scare the investors, to scare people in business. It’s to scare people into not buying Treasury bills at auctions. It’s to scare people into leaving, cashing out of the stock market — and sure enough, as the show began today, the stock market — the Dow Jones Industrial Average — was down about 900 points, supposedly because of the latest news about the spread of the coronavirus. And if you go deeper into China, you will see that all of the high-tech Silicon Valley firms are said to be terribly exposed. “They could be suffering a disastrous year. Why, you may not be able to buy a new iPhone of any model this whole year! Do you know that? Because the coronavirus is so bad that the factories may never open — and if they do, they may not be anywhere near full capacity.” So Apple may not be able to release any new product. You think that’s not gonna panic investors? It most certainly is. So Apple is trying to do what they can to suggest that these rumors are not true. They got new products coming this year. But the tech media hates Apple. They love anti-Apple stories. They love anything that will let them report that Apple’s on its last legs. Of course, that’s not true. Warren Buffett came out today and said, “Apple is the best run company ever.” He’s a big stockholder. So people will say he’s biased about it. But the bias you have to pay attention to is how much money he invested. He got $36 billion in Apple stock that Berkshire Hathaway has. They sold $800 million of Apple stock last week, and everybody said, “Oh, my God, he’s getting out!” No, he’s not. He’s got $36 billion. He sold $800 million. No big deal. He wanted to allocate it somewhere else. So this is… I think the coronavirus is an effort to get Trump. It’s not gonna work. It’s one of the latest in a long line of efforts that the Drive-By Media’s making to somehow say that Trump and capitalism are destroying America and destroying the world. Just keep in mind where the coronavirus came from. It came from a country that Bernie Sanders wants to turn the United States into a mirror image of: Communist China. That’s where it came from. It didn’t come from an American lab. It didn’t escape from an American research lab. It hasn’t been spread by Americans. It starts out in a communist country. Its tentacles spread all across the world in numbers that are not big and not huge, but they’re being reported as just the opposite. Just trying to keep it all in perspective.",1,

44,US Hospitals Getting Paid More to Label Cause of Death as ‘Coronavirus’,Wayne Dupree,"Dr. Scott Jensen says the American Medical Association is now “encouraging” doctors to overcount coronavirus deaths across the country.

Jensen received a  7-page document that showed him how to fill out a death certificate as a “COVID-19 diagnosis” even when there isn’t a lab test confirming the diagnosis.

“Right now Medicare is determining that if you have a COVID-19 admission to the hospital you get $13,000. If that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator you get $39,000, three times as much. Nobody can tell me after 35 years in the world of medicine that sometimes those kinds of things impact on what we do.” (Dr. Sen. Scott Jensen, from Fox Interview)

33,Fauci Knew About HCQ In 2005 – Nobody Needed To Die,Bryan Fischer,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses. How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim. The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health - published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, “We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.” Dr. Anthony FauciThis means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (“therapeutic”) but prevent future cases (“prophylactic”). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.” Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus. He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.” The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms. But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas. Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2. On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings. “Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.” Said Dr. Zelenko: ""If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good. All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting."" The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms. While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.” So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died. This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934. Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem. So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over. Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic. It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment? There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word. Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world.",1,
303,Manchester United will have first Jadon Sancho transfer bid rejected - EXCLUSIVE | Football | Sport | Express.co.uk,Luke Gardener,"  Manchester United are determined to complete a transfer for Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho this summer. But the England winger will still cost over Â£100million despite the coronavirus crisis.   Thatâ€™s according to University of Liverpool senior teacher and football finance expert Kieran Maguire.  He expects Dortmund to be in a strong position after the coronavirus crisis but United will have the resources to spend big as well despite the pandemic.  Sancho has been in sensational form this season, netting 17 goals and providing 19 assists in all competitions.  Maguire exclusively told Express Sport: â€œYouâ€™ve got to look at it on a deal by deal basis.  JUST IN: Premier League clubs fear hopes of completing season are disappearing after latest meeting      â€œFirst of all Manchester United have a strong balance sheet, they had Â£100m in the bank at the end of December, I appreciate that since then they have signed Bruno Fernandes.  â€œBut even so Manchester United are very successful, theyâ€™ve got great commercial revenue generation so I think they are in a strong position to buy then youâ€™ve got to look at the individual position of the clubs that are selling.  â€œDortmund, I think will be in a relatively strong position to resist offers, or resist the first offer.â€  Maguire also gave an update on Jack Grealish potentially moving from Aston Villa to United and how that transfer could be complicated.

67,Video: Nevada Nurse in NYC: COVID Is Not Killing People – They’re Being Murdered,Brian Shilhavy,"Another nurse who has traveled to New York City to help with treating COVID-19 patients has gone public, describing the horrors she is seeing in how patients are being treated.

Nicole Sirotek is reported to be from Nevada, and she expressed her frustrations in a Facebook Live broadcast, apparently Sunday, May 3rd. Her video and Facebook Page appear to have been removed by Facebook Monday morning, although the video has surfaced elsewhere.

While trying to hold back her tears, she claims:

“Nobody is listening. They don’t care what is happening to these people. They don’t. I’m literally coming here every day and watching them kill them.”

She explains that everyone coming into her hospital, which she claims is “in the hood,” is labeled as a COVID patient, but that they are not dying from COVID, but from poor medical care.

She claims that every time she tries to advocate for her patients because they are receiving poor medical care, that they reassign the patient to someone else.

Because her patients are minorities, Latinos at the first hospital she was at, and Blacks at her current assignment, she has even tried to reach out to advocacy groups who specialize in advocating for these minority groups, but no one seems to want to listen to her.

100% of her patients have died, and she makes it clear that although she is not a doctor, she is sure that these patients are not getting the proper treatment they deserve.

She claims that she has even been assigned to care for patients that are already dead, because medical personnel are not even using disposable stethoscopes to verify that they are still alive.

This is going to be kind of an extreme example, but this is really the only thing I can come up with. It’s like if we were in Nazi Germany and they were like, taking the Jews to go put them in a gas chamber.

I’m the one there saying like, “Hey, this is not good, this is bad, this is wrong, we should not be doing this.”

Then everyone tells me “hang in there, you’re doing a great job, you can’t save everybody. You’re amazing, you’re a great nurse.”",1,
448,"Uber Direct and Connect will deliver toilet paper, meds, and more",Sasha Lekach,"Since people in quarantine don't need many Uber rides, the company is now delivering goods. Uber announced Monday the official launch of Uber Direct and Uber Connect, two trial programs that let people get groceries, medications, and basic supplies, like toilet paper, delivered. Direct brings items from stores to people's homes. In New York City, Cabinet is delivering medical supplies and toiletries, while Greencross in Australia is sending out pet supplies. Since we're all keeping our distance, Uber Connect lets you send care packages or extra supplies to a friend or family member nearby. If you scored a bulk load of toilet paper at Costco you can spread the wealth to your friend across town. The two programs also give drivers an opportunity to earn something while still using the Uber platform. Uber Connect is available in 25 cities across the U.S., Mexico, and Australia. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi spoke about the urgency of the new programs in an email statement, ""Our primary focus is the immediate: quickly adapting our technology to meet the evolving needs of communities and companies. While things are moving at a rapid pace, we are leaning in to delivery at Uber speed, and keeping our eyes on the future.â€ SEE ALSO: Coronavirus outbreak means gig workers from Uber, Lyft barely get paid On Thursday the company officially withdrew its financial guidance for future earnings, blaming the downturn on the impact of coronavirus and social distancing norms. People are not hailing rides like they were just a few months ago. This isn't the first time Uber has transported goods. Back in 2015, it launched Uber Rush, a courier service that used drivers to deliver items from stores to people's doors. It came from Uber's early, broad-strokes concept of Uber Everything (yes, that was the real name) to transport, well, everything from people to food to packages to groceries and beyond. Keeping that everything vibe going, last year Uber acquired Cornershop, a Chilean grocery delivery startup in Latin America and Canada. The deal is in regulation limbo, but it was supposed to bump up Uber's involvement in the delivery world beyond restaurant orders through Uber Eats. 1/@cornershopmx is proud to be working extra hard for the 3rd consecutive weekend to try to meet a sudden increase in demand for grocery delivery, although weâ€™re struggling with being under-resourced. â€” Oskar Hjertonsson (@ohjertonsson) March 22, 2020 Lyft is also making drivers available for different types of paid work, like delivering medical supplies and meals for vulnerable children and seniors.",0,
365,Fed's Bullard: Coronavirus shutdown not a recession; an investment in survival,,"In normal times massive unemployment and a collapse in economic output would be tragic. This time, as the coronavirus cloisters millions of Americans and shuts down the U.S. economy, it should instead be saluted as an investment in public health that lays the groundwork for a rapid rebound. That is the view of St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, who argues that a potential $2.5 trillion hit coming to the economy is both necessary and manageable if officials move fast and keep it simple. It may seem an unconventional view in a moment of global anxiety, but Bullard argues the shutdown measures now being rolled out are essential to shortening the course of the pandemic. They must also be coupled with massive federal government support to sustain the population through its coming isolation and prime the economy to pick up where it left off. To Bullard that means: Match any lost wages. Match any lost business. No questions asked. No arguments about bailouts or ""moral hazard"" - the sticky issue of publicly funded rescues of bad actors. And, above all, when the losses are tallied, don't call it a recession. Recessions are the ordinary - even predictable - contractions in activity that mark the end of normal business cycles. Bullard, who has earned a reputation inside the Fed for a penchant to rethink problems and reframe debates, said this is anything but. ""Frame this as a massive investment in U.S. public health,"" Bullard said in a Friday telephone interview. Bullard's comments came as U.S. lawmakers debated emergency economic measures worth $1 trillion or more, a figure Bullard says may underestimate what's needed. Nonetheless it is still opening old wounds from the 2007-2009 economic crisis over who deserves what, whether corporations should get help, and how generous the government should be with workers. The spread of the coronavirus has touched off those discussions worldwide, but with an urgency that is shredding old hesitancies. United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government on Friday announced it would pick up 80% of the national wage bill for the next three months. Many Fed officials have called for a stronger U.S. fiscal response in recent days, but Bullard went a step further with an explicit call for the U.S. government to match what is being lost dollar for dollar. For now, he said, economists and policymakers should turn their view of data on its head because little will make sense otherwise. The recent jump in unemployment claims? That's a win, a sign that so-called government stabilizers are being used. The hope should be that such programs get ""crazy heavy use"" in coming weeks, he said. If economic output falls by half in the second quarter, that's a win â€” not a record-setting defeat. It means businesses have heeded orders to close and customers to stay home. ""We are not trying to move production and income up in the second quarter. We are trying to keep it out of the second quarter,"" Bullard said. ""You want capital to just sit in place. Switch off the factory ... Then switch it back on."" Bullard was among the large group at the Fed who at first felt the virus risk would pass with little economic damage, as have other similar health scares such as SARS and ebola. They are all now trying to catch up, with emergency rate cuts, extensive new programs to keep markets working, and other steps to aid an economy grinding to a halt. In line with his colleagues, he said he was ready to do more, including putting more of the Fed's direct lending powers to work if needed. ""It is early days and we are willing to do more. I am willing to do more,"" he said. Bullard was blunt about the dilemma posed, saying the economics profession was ""reeling"" as it tries to understand what is taking place. For now what's usually good â€” jobs and production â€” are bad, and the headline numbers are going to be staggering. Bullard's ballpark estimate is that unemployment could hit 30%, higher than in the Great Depression and three times more than the 2007-2009 recession. Output in the second quarter could be half the norm, a hit of about $2.5 trillion. That is unavoidable if the virus is to be contained through ""social distancing"" or government orders to stay at home. All this needn't wreck the economy. Legislation working its way through Congress has begun to roll out some support. Bullard said the ""core aim"" can be kept simple: ""keep everyone, households and businesses whole through the second quarter."" Do it with a quick expansion of unemployment insurance to cover lost wages, and through grants and loans to business to cover losses from ""unemployed"" capital. From a macroeconomic standpoint, he argues, it is a tractable problem. Again using back of the envelope math and a 30,000-foot view, he said perhaps half a trillion dollars of lost output will be accounted for by necessarily lost consumption - all the movie tickets and clothes no one buys and trips people will not take. As to the other $2 trillion, Bullard said the federal government should borrow and distribute it to people and business. ""That is completely feasible,"" in service of limiting economic damage, he said. ""This is a planned, organized partial shut down of the U.S. economy. We are throttling back output on purpose to meet health guidelines... Transfer income to affected households."" ""Call it pandemic relief,"" Bullard said. ""Get transfers to businesses that are affected heavily, and come out on the other side. Identical economy. Produce the same goods as before.""",0,
245,Shanghai Government Officially Recommends Vitamin C for COVID-19,Andrew W. Saul,"he government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. (1) Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.
These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C's effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, ""Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.""
Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.
Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.
An official statement from Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital (2) reads:
""On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).""",1,

266,Vitamin C and COVID-19 Coronavirus,Damien Downing,"There is only one existing treatment for the new coronavirus: vitamin C. Vitamin C supports your immune system.
Vitamin C helps to kill the virus and reduces the symptoms of infection.
It's not a COVID ""cure,"" but nothing is.
It might just save your life, though, and will definitely reduce the severity of the infection. If someone tells you it's not proven, consider two things:

Nothing is proven to work against COVID-19, because it is a new virus.
Vitamin C has worked against every single virus including influenzas, pneumonia, and even poliomyelitis.
What to do: If you do nothing else, start taking vitamin C right away; at least 3 grams a day, spread right across the day. That's a 1,000 milligram capsule every 8 hours, or a level teaspoon of powder dissolved in a pint or so of water, drank all through the day.

If you're smart and motivated, do all the other things recommended in our previous release Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus.

When and if you catch a bug that might be COVID-19, simply increase your vitamin C intake: a rounded teaspoon (that's 4 to 5 grams) in water (which helps to keep you hydrated) every 3 or 4 hours. And keep on taking it.

Do you consult a doctor? Do you self-isolate? Yes and yes. Of course you do; that's your duty to others.

Vitamin C and the other measures are what you do for yourself.",1,
506,Virtual funerals during the coronavirus pandemic: How to plan a meaningful one - CNN,"Ryan Prior, CNN","(CNN) On a recent Sunday, Alicia de Artola sat watching a funeral for her maternal grandmother, Martha Palacios, who had just died at the age of 96. Because even modest gatherings for any purpose are banned all over the country, this funeral was almost entirely online. About 50 people or households were present and participating in the funeral via the Zoom call, with another 50 or so tuning in to watch the simultaneous Facebook livestream of the proceedings, she said. The 30-year-old writer and podcaster, based in Los Angeles, was close with her grandmother.  She helped out as a caregiver in her later years. Now she actively helped plan many aspects of the virtual service in her memory. ""When we found out we couldn't do something graveside, we decided to do it virtually,"" she said. ""It was important for us to do the ritual."" They laid out a hope chest -- adorned with roses -- in the center of their living room, symbolizing a casket.

Alicia de Artola said the virtual funeral for her grandmother drew about 50 participants or households via Zoom, and another 50 or so via a Facebook livestream at the same time. Make the virtual funeral feel 'official' The whole family used their imagination and skills to make the virtual funeral as immersive as possible, so they could suspend disbelief during the ceremony. Coronavirus preys on what terrifies us: dying alone As a podcaster, de Artola contributed her sound equipment and audio expertise to the production. Another family friend who is a professional church singer contributed a musical interlude, and another stepped in with an Irish blessing to close the virtual service. ""Most of the people on the call waited to say something. After it was over, we called on people,"" she said. ""It was essentially a virtual receiving line."" She didn't realize it at the time, but she would soon after attend a second virtual funeral. A few days later, her paternal grandmother died. For that funeral, she was less an active planner and participated more as a family mourner, and despite the distance, she said she found value in seeing her aunts and cousins on screen. ""What are the chances that two of my remaining grandparents would die in a two-week period during a pandemic, and not from the thing causing a pandemic?"" she wondered. As nearly every memorial service must now incorporate an online component, the National Funeral Directors Association is offering guidance on how to plan and host a virtual funeral. A small group of mourners gathered for a home Mass honoring Martha Palacios. More than 100 others participated in the service online. Virtual funerals are everywhere now Dutch Nie, a funeral director for Nie Family Funeral Homes in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said that in light of the coronavirus pandemic, he has needed to introduce virtual funeral services, which he hadn't needed to offer before. He followed the news as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's social distancing policies progressively forbade gatherings of 100 people, then 50, then 10. Virtual services became a necessity, especially with the uptick of deaths in his community. And besides livestreaming ceremonies, handing off cremated remains to families is a different process under social distancing guidelines. He said he and colleagues leave flowers, a lit candle, and a loved one's remains in the funeral home's vestibule. ""We take universal precautions when handling remains,"" he said, noting that behind the scenes, ""there's no difference in services."" They keep the building's doors locked, and families call from the parking lot, giving the signal that they are ready to pick up the urn. Funerals are the latest part of American life to move online While there's an immediate need to acknowledge a loved one's death through some sort of virtual observance, he said, many families are opting for a larger in-person event once it becomes safe to do so. Nie said one new development was ""that families are booking out (his funeral home) in June, July and August."" That ability to plan ahead is a change of pace for the funeral home industry, Nie noted. Although families often have six months or more to plan out the perfect wedding, the average funeral gets put together with just a few days' notice. Watching a graveside ceremony from home Mike Powers, a 21-year-old college student in Norwalk, Connecticut, told CNN he'd recently attended a virtual service for his aunt, Marianne Malone, who died from Covid-19. She went to the doctor in late March with symptoms. After a week, Powers got a call that her lung had collapsed. She died April 6, he said. Three days later, from a screen many miles away, he watched his aunt's graveside ceremony. The family's pastor led the short service. From weddings to funerals, the coronavirus is canceling life's biggest moments and leaving families heartbroken ""It was very eerie to be a part of,"" he said. ""You can't console (your family). You can't be there for them. It was probably the hardest thing I've done in a really long time."" At one point in the ceremony, he saw family members laying roses on Malone's grave. ""That really hit me and I got really emotional,"" he said. Watching the virtual ceremony didn't feel like enough to Powers, so two days later he went to his aunt's grave -- alone -- to pay his respects properly. ""It's not the way you want to go,"" he said. ""A virtual funeral is not the way to go."" Make sure to grieve, even if it has to be online ""There's something about the rituals being done the right way,"" grief expert David Kessler told CNN. He acknowledged that virtual funerals ""may feel wrong, impersonal or sacrilegious. But what's worse is people's grief not being witnessed."" Although nothing can replace the hugging, embracing and direct human experience of an in-person service, virtual services are still real and can incorporate most of the main elements you'd expect in a traditional service. And even though they may be virtual, services should still maintain their serious tone, noted Kessler, who co-authored the book ""On Grief and Grieving"" with renowned bereavement expert Elisabeth KÃ¼bler-Ross. Grieving for my mother in the age of Covid-19 Even basic videoconferencing technologies can often accommodate a clergy person speaking, the performance of music, and opportunities to play videos. ""This is a moment to dress up, even online,"" he said. ""You shouldn't be in a T-shirt in a lounge chair eating a sandwich.""

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. He said he started the sessions as the pandemic spread and social distancing guidelines became more commonplace. About 7,000 people have joined his online grief group since he set it up a month ago as social distancing was going national. With more grief around the world and fewer ways to express or process it with others, he said he's feeling a massive demand for his expertise.

265,Does the 2019 Coronavirus Exist?,David Crowe,"The Coronavirus scare that emanated from Wuhan, China in December of 2019 is an epidemic of testing. There is no proof that a virus is being detected by the test and there is absolutely no concern about whether there are a significant number of false positives on the test. What is being published in medical journals is not science, every paper has the goal of enhancing the panic by interpreting the data only in ways that benefit the viral theory, even when the data is confusing or contradictory. In other words, the medical papers are propaganda. It is also an epidemic by definition. The definition, which assumes perfection from the test, does not have the safety valve that the definition of SARS did, thus the scare can go on until public health officials change the definition or realize that the test is not reliable. What I learned from studying SARS, the previous big coronavirus scare, after the 2003 epidemic, was that nobody had proved a coronavirus existed, let alone was pathogenic. There was evidence against transmission, and afterwards, negative assessments of the extreme treatments that patients were subjected to, the nucleoside analog antiviral drug Ribavirin, high dose corticosteroids, invasive respiratory assistance, and sometimes oseltamivir (Tamiflu). The world is suffering from a massive delusion based on the belief that a test for RNA is a test for a deadly new virus, a virus that has emerged from wild bats in China, supported by the western assumption that Chinese people will eat anything that moves. If the virus exists, then it should be possible to purify viral particles. From these particles RNA can be extracted and should match the RNA used in this test. Until this is done it is possible that the RNA comes from another source, which could be the cells of the patient, bacteria, fungi etc. There might be an association with elevated levels of RNA and illness, but that is not proof that the RNA is from a virus. Without purification and characterization of virus particles, it cannot be accepted that an RNA test is proof that a virus is present.

Officially the virus is called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it is believed to caused, COVID-19. We will just refer to coronavirus for the current virus panic, and SARS for the 2003 panic.

Definitions of important diseases are surprisingly loose, perhaps embarrassingly so. A couple of symptoms, maybe contact with a previous patient, and a test of unknown accuracy, is all you often need. While the definition of SARS, an earlier coronavirus panic, was self-limiting, the definition of the new coronavirus disease is open-ended, allowing the imaginary epidemic to grow. Putting aside the existence of the virus, if the coronavirus test has a problem with false positives (as all biological tests do) then testing an uninfected population will produce positive tests, and the definition of the disease will allow the epidemic to go on forever. This strange new disease, officially named COVID-19, has none of its own symptoms. Fever and cough, previously blamed on uncountable viruses and bacteria, as well as environmental contaminants, are most common, as well as abnormal lung images, despite those being found in healthy people. Yet, despite the fact that only a minority of people tested will test positive (often less than 5%), it is assumed that this disease is easily recognized. If that was the truly the case, the majority of people routed for testing by doctors should be positive.

The coronavirus test is based on PCR, a manufacturing technique. When used as a test it does not produce a positive/negative result, but simply the number of cycles required to detect genetic material. The division between positive and negative is an arbitrary number of cycles chosen by the testers. If positive means infected and negative means uninfected, then there are cases of people going from infected to uninfected and back to infected again in a couple of days.

A lot of people say it is better to be safe than sorry. Better that some people are quarantined who are actually uninfected than risk a pandemic. But once people test positive, they are likely to be treated, with treatments similar to SARS. Doctors faced with what they believe is a deadly virus treat for the future, for anticipated symptoms, not for what they see today. This leads to the use of invasive oxygenation, high dose corticosteroids and antiviral drugs. In this case, some populations of those diagnosed (e.g. in China) are older and sicker than the general population and much less able to withstand aggressive treatment. After the SARS panic had subsided doctors reviewed the evidence, and it showed that these treatments were often ineffective, and all had serious side effects, such as persistent neurologic deficit, joint replacements, scarring, pain and liver disease.",1,

175,CORONAVIRUS HYSTERIA HITS RUSSIA AS EUROPE BECOMES CENTER OF OUTBREAK,Anonymous,"During the past week, the center of the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) officially moved from China to the European Union. Italy already overcame the number of active cases in China.

Furthermore, Italy demonstares sky-high numbers of deaths and total coronavirus cases per a million of population. In aprticular, open sources numbers show that every fourteenth person affected by coronavirus in Italy dies. These numbers cause reasonable questions because there are not so much explanations of the observed crisis in Europe. So, the entire Italian government is disfunctional and demonstrates a criminal negligence, or the available statistics exaggerates the scale of crisis. If one supposes that the Italian government is interested in fueling the hysteria and crisis to achieve some own goals (to support the global campaign in the field or gain tactical economic benefits as additional funding from the EU), it may look that authorities count any virus infection death or even deaths caused some other reasons as coronavirus-caused deaths. The European developments followed the official Chinese declaration of conerns regarding the possibiltiy that the coronavirus outbreak may have been a preplanned action (Beijing  blamed the US military) aimed against China and the entire crisis is being manipulated to fuel instability and further. The coronavirus hysteria rapidly expanded into other European countries (even not really affected by the oubreak) and even Russia. The Russian opposition media and representatives of the so-called neo-liberal part of the elite are already cry foul about the supposed coronavirus-related problems. According to them, the country is ‘fully unprepared’ to fight the possible outbreak. These claims are being supported by a large-scale media campaign in the field.

It’s interesting to note that all of these happens amid the chaos on the oil market (caused by Saudi agressive actions on it), constitutional reforms in Russia and the escalation of the Iranian-US tensions in the Middle East (Iran is currently suffering from coronavirus-related issues with over 12,000 active cases).

The large-scale diplomatic and media efforts to paint the coronavirus oubtreak as a large-scale threat and the timing of developments demonstrate allow to suggest that forces related to the global establishment are intentionally exploiting and fueling the crisis (or even contributed to its start) in order to achieve own goals. The COVID-19 issue is already used to explain the upcoming global economic crisis (which is barely caused by the virus itself), and will likely be used among the tools used to distabilize situation inside the countries opposing the neo-liberal world order: China, Russia and Iran.",1,
214,MODERNA VACCINE WHITE PAPER – “DNA VACCINES HAVE A RISK OF PERMANENTLY CHANGING A PERSON’S DNA”,Dylan Charles,"In light of the conversation and growing debate about the rapid development of a Covid-19 vaccine, many are watching closely to see who wins the race.

There is a ton of money in this, as evidenced by the recent $200 billion stock market bubble in vaccines that started when the pandemic began to affect Western nations and politicians and experts began talking up the need for a vaccine in order to ‘return to normal.‘


Stephen Gandel reports for CBS:

“In the past two months alone, Wall Street investors have pumped billions into a handful of biotech companies in the early stages of producing vaccines or drugs to combat the novel coronavirus… The result: a coronavirus investment bubble that’s already approaching nearly $200 billion in stock market value.” [Source]

Leading the pack at present is biotech firm Moderna, who recently made headlines for attempting the first human trials of a CV vaccine. Their efforts are financially backed by Bill Gates and when they were first announced, Moderna stock value jumped significantly. However, shortly thereafter a number of participants in the trial reported adverse effects including high fever. Moderna stock has been on a roller coaster ever since.

The New York Post reported on May 18, 2020:

“Biotech company Moderna Inc. dosed 45 patients between the ages of 18 and 55 with 25, 100 or 250 micrograms of its experimental drug. After receiving a second booster shot, those at the 25 and 100 dosage levels were found with antibody levels that were equal to or exceeded those found in patients who recovered from COVID-19, the company said in a press release.” [Source]

On May 22nd, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. wrote a follow up on the trials, noting:

“Despite Moderna’s cheery press release this week, the clinical trial results for its groundbreaking COVID vaccine could not be much worse.

The vaccine, developed and championed by Anthony Fauci and financed by Bill Gates, used an experimental mRNA technology…

Three of the 15 human guinea pigs in the high dose cohort (250 mcg) suffered a ‘serious adverse event’ within 43 days of receiving Moderna’s jab. Moderna…acknowledged that three volunteers developed Grade 3 systemic events defined by the FDA as ‘Preventing daily activity and requiring medical intervention’.

Moderna allowed only exceptionally healthy volunteers to participate in the study. A vaccine with those reaction rates could cause grave injuries in 1.5 billion humans if administered to ‘every person on earth’.” ~Robert F Kennedy, Jr.


Then on May 27th, the New York Post followed up, reporting on participants who fell ill:

“A volunteer in a key coronavirus vaccine trial has revealed that it left him the sickest he has ever been in his life — but still “cautiously optimistic” about the drug’s potential.

Ian Haydon, 29, identified himself in a series of interviews as one of four volunteers who had bad reactions during the trials that Moderna hailed for “positive” early findings of antibody responses.” [Source]

During all of this, Moderna’s top executives have cashed out a record $89 million in stock, as reported by Stat:

“The top five executives at the biotech company Moderna have sold more than $89 million of stock so far this year — initiating nearly three times as many stock transactions than in all of 2019 — as the company’s share price has soared on hopes for its Covid-19 vaccine…

But the volume and timing might prove alarming to Moderna’s shareholders, especially in light of the company’s May decision to raise more than $1 billion in a stock offering.” [Source]

Stat goes on to ask the important question:

“If Moderna’s early-stage vaccine can one day prevent coronavirus infection and the company’s best days lay ahead, why are insiders selling?” [Source]

Indeed, why are executives cashing out when other investors are jumping in?

We recently published an article highlighting statements from Bill Gates, published on his personal blog, where Gates expressed his enthusiasm for the rapid development of a CV vaccine may use experimental mRNA/DNA technology, which we believe runs the risk of altering human DNA.

READ: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Responds to Bill Gates’ Statements on a Mandatory Coronavirus Vaccine
Facebook fact-checking organization Politifact flagged our article as false, commenting that mRNA and DNA vaccines have been proven safe, although neither have ever been approved for human use.

Furthermore, Politifact also noted that our claim that this new class of vaccines may alter human DNA was false, saying that, “RNA vaccines have been shown to create “a safe and long-lasting immune response in animal models and humans”  in clinical and preclinical trials.”

Politifact continues:

“The most recent research also shows that RNA vaccines, which are being tested for COVID-19 right now, do degrade naturally and don’t alter DNA permanently…

An article in Frontiers on Immunology analyzed new studies that found mRNA “cannot potentially integrate into the host genome and will be degraded naturally.” Basically, after the messenger molecules create antigens for the body to react to, they will naturally stop being used and break down.” [Source]

Out of concern for health freedom and public awareness we looked a little deeper into this issue, and while there is relatively little reporting on this to date, a 2017 Moderna white paper entitled, mRNA Vaccines: Disruptive Innovation in Vaccination, touches on this issue. In a section titled ‘DNA Vaccines,’ the following safety concern about DNA vaccines (not mRNA vaccines ) is documented:

“DNA vaccine work began thirty years ago, but as yet there are no licensed DNA vaccines and most remain in Phase 1 testing.

The key challenge associated with DNA vaccines is that they must penetrate the cell nucleus (crossing two membranes; the cytoplasm and the nucleus). The DNA must then be transcribed in the nucleus into mRNA before moving to the cytoplasm to stimulate antigen production. This core complex pathway often requires both larger doses and special, often painful delivery devices using electric shocks or gold microspheres into person’s skin to deliver the DNA vaccine. Once inside the nucleus, DNA vaccines have a risk of permanently changing a person’s DNA.” [Source]

Given the financial stakes involved and the potential that a rapidly developed CV vaccine may be forced upon those not willing to take a vaccine, there is an urgent need for understanding of the fact that vaccines in general, and specifically the new generation of vaccines being developed for CV, come with legitimate safety concerns which are rarely reported on by mainstream media, and in many cases even censored on social media.

If informed consent is indeed the law of the land, journalists should be working to uncover the unbiased truth on these issues, and for something like this, there is no better source than the actual developer of the vaccine. Without accurate and complete information, informed consent is not possible.",1,

3,"Church Services Can’t Resume Until We’re All Vaccinated, Says Bill Gates",News Divison,"Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder who is currently worth approximately 102 billion dollars, is spending a fortune on eugenics and sterilization around the world. For Gates, “vaccines” seem to be his solution for the greatest problem – in his view – that exists…people. As you can see in the video below, Gates lauds vaccines as a way to limit the human population. Notice that after claiming the Earth must see a zero CO2 impact from humanity by limiting “services” to zero, Gates claims that part of his depopulation goal is vaccines. How would vaccines lead to depopulation, when they’re ostensibly designed to make people healthy? Well, Gates is spending a whopping sum on contraception, abortion, and sterilization in Third World countries, but there’s a little secret about his vaccines as well. Bill Gates’ vaccines have made news reports in recent days for (supposedly inadvertently) containing sterilization meds. Who would have thought? Gates and his world-depopulation taskforce basically said “oopsie” and moved ahead. Facebook’s fact-checker, Africa Check, claims the stories are bogus but, quite frankly, Africa Check said our article about the LGBT demanding to be treated as a priority for coronavirus was bogus, and they only took issue with our use of scare quotes around the word “transgender.” So honestly, we don’t believe them. Facebook’s owner, Mark Zuckerberg, is partnering with Gates in his vaccine agenda, so their in-house “fact-checker” is hardly impartial. And now, Gates is leading the fight (he’s a computer guy, right?) to find a coronavirus vaccine. And Gates now argues that “mass gatherings” (churches) will not meet again until a vaccine is found and everyone is vaccinated. The press reports Gates said, “What does opening up look like? Which activities, like schools, can be done in a way that the risk of transmission is very low? And which activities, like mass gatherings, maybe — in a certain sense — more optional? Until you’re widely vaccinated, those may not come back at all.” Gates has suggested a “digital tracking program” be put in place to designate people as immune to coronavirus or infected, a program of immense implications for personal liberty and privacy.

Coronavirus being studied in Winnipeg

Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg has a sample of the new coronavirus that is causing infections in a number of countries, most notably Saudi Arabia.

 

Scientific director Dr. Frank Plummer says the lab obtained the virus from the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

The Dutch lab was the one that first identified the new virus last June in a sample from a Saudi man who had died of a mysterious illness.

 

Plummer says the coronavirus arrived at the Winnipeg facility on May 4.

 

The lab is growing up stocks of the virus and will use it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada, he says.

As well, Winnipeg scientists plan to do some work to see which animal species can be infected with the virus.

198,Does 5G Make Us More Susceptible to Coronavirus Infection?,Dr. Jospeh Mercola,"In this interview, Brian Hoyer — one of the primary consultants for my latest book, “EMF*D” — discusses how electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation may be impacting the COVID-19 epidemic and your infection risk. Many have raised questions about whether there is a connection between 5G and this pandemic.

In some ways, the connection between COVID-19 and 5G is a moot issue. In other ways, it’s not. Either way, it’s tangential to what you need to do now to protect yourself and your family from here on out. At the time of this interview, which took place March 31, 2020, a vast majority of those who have died from COVID-19 were elderly.

Those who died in China and Italy under the age of 50 have generally been encumbered with obesity, diabetes and hypertension, with insulin resistance being the common denominator. Very few under the age of 19 are affected.

That said, the infection appears to be more aggressive than influenza in older individuals, and the illness lasts longer than the regular flu. So, there’s enhanced virulence to this virus for some reason we yet do not understand. While unproven, one current theory is that EMF radiation — and the addition of 5G in particular — could be having an impact. Hoyer cites data from Dr. Arthur Firstenberg’s book, “The Invisible Rainbow,”1 in which he catalogued epidemiological evidence showing that as electrification of the world was implemented, throughout the course of history, viral pandemics ensued.

“The big one in there that’s been cited on the internet about possible connection to 5G is, if you go back to 1918 when the Spanish flu went around the world, that was when the first radio telegraphs were more widely used.

You see the Spanish flu popping up all over the world, but [not] in a way [that would suggest] we are passing it from person to person, but [it popped up on] one side of the world to the other side of the world very quickly.

Today, we wouldn’t know if that’s happening because we travel so frequently. And there are theories out there about how viruses actually transmit from person to person … That said, what we have is probably the unhealthiest population in the history of mankind … as far as chronic conditions … We also have more sterility …

But we also have more practices of separation and decontamination, and all of those things are better than ever before. So why is this virus spreading so rapidly?

I believe it has to be the terrain of the individual and also environmental stressors that are creating this perfect storm where a virus has an easy way to get into the body and can actually reproduce on the cellular level inside of the human body. Which is really how viruses work. It’s not the same as bacteria. I think a lot of people have that false sense that a virus is just a smaller version of a bacteria.” In his book, Firstenberg brings up this concept that there is a connection between EMF and influenza. And, this connection existed far before the advent and introduction of man-made EMFs, which probably happened in very small quantities in the late 18th century.

But, he also describes something called the maunder minimum, which lasted from 1645 to 1715. Essentially, this was a period of time when the sun was very quiet and had very few or no sun spots.

Then, in 1727, the number of sun spots increased to over 100 for the first time in over a century. Now, I know this is ancient history, but it’s important to understand that because in 1728, influenza arrived in waves over the entire planet and it was the first flu pandemic in almost 150 years.

So, this is the first hint, at least historically, that there might be a connection between EMF and viral illness because, in the solar flare, you’re going to have increased radiation. The next major pandemic was in 1889, and the interesting part of this, which Hoyer mentioned, is that this infection was established pretty much everywhere all at once.

We obviously did not have transcontinental flights the way we did in the current COVID-19 disease. It appears to have emerged in Wuhan City, China, where, incidentally, 5G had recently been rolled out, but millions of people traveled in and out of that area and on to other parts of the world.

Well, the 1889 epidemic took place at a time when we didn’t have the ability to travel very fast or far. Yet, the pandemic emerged very rapidly in widely scattered regions around the world. Interestingly, in 1889, we saw the emergence of what Firstenberg calls power line harmonics. According to Firstenberg, that changed the Earth’s magnetic field, ushering in the 1889 influenza pandemic.

Next, there was the Spanish flu of 1918, which also spread far more rapidly than it could or should have were it spread through travel. In 1918, radio was the emerging technology. Firstenberg’s revised edition also mentions 5G technology.

In summary, his book builds a case for the theory that increases in EMFs, natural or man-made, might make us more susceptible or sensitive to viral illnesses. If natural EMF exposures have the ability to influence our biology, it’s not so hard to imagine that man-made exposures might have an exponential impact. Hoyer adds:

“Things are happening now that have never happened before. We [have] a lot of people who are electrosensitive. One of the things they report is that … they feel sick during lightning storms with influenza-type symptoms. Flashes of lightning create a radio frequency. It’s called microwave sickness in the literature.

A lot of people call it electromagnetic hypersensitivity or electrosensitivity, but in a lot of the literature, you have to look up microwave sickness … Then you’ll find these references to when storms come, when solar flares are active, people are getting more and more symptoms.

Depression is a huge thing that happens when there’s more solar radiation and also during a full moon even. So, there’s a lot of natural electromagnetic radiation that happens. Most of that is gradual, but with the radio frequency (RF) lightning pulses, those are definitely a pulsed phenomenon … I think it’s in the kilohertz range. But it varies … it’s never the same frequency, it’s always different.

You’ll actually hear it when the lightning goes off and if you have a really sensitive meter, when you turn on and off light switches, you can hear the arcing and there’s an RF that transmits out from that arcing that happens … Solar flares … can affect all types of electronics and can cause electromagnetic interference, and that is technically in the kilohertz to megahertz range.”A significant problem with man-made EMFs is that they’re pulsed. We are also surrounded by RF radiation, both analog RF signals from radio stations and pulsed RF signals.

“A lot of times I wonder, ‘What would a real study look like if you have the 50 Hz to 60 Hz modulation and the RF and everything?’ Usually, in these studies, they’re just testing one thing in a controlled environment.

They’re never testing the entire soup that we’re constantly bathed in as human beings. We’re the big experiment here and they’re just testing one thing at a time in this Western medicine type of fashion,” Hoyer notes. With regard to COVID-19, underlying health conditions clearly appear to play a role. However, we don’t know whether the use of certain drugs might have a bearing on the severity of the disease and its outcome.

For example, while French doctors say they’ve noticed a pattern that patients given ibuprofen fared worse than those given acetaminophen, their findings have been largely ignored simply because there are no studies to prove it.

When did clinical findings become useless? If anything, clinical suspicions should be rapidly considered and acted upon during an active pandemic when time is of the essence. At this time, we really need to listen to the medical professionals in the field who are treating patients. During a March 12, 2020, lecture at the Health and Human Rights Summit in Tucson, Arizona, Dr. Thomas Cowan likely stunned the audience by bringing up a potential connection between 5G and COVID-19.

By and large, many of the areas hardest hit by COVID-19 have recently implemented 5G which, at least theoretically, might render residents more prone to serious infection by lowering their immune function.

Cowan also presents the theory that COVID-19 and other influenza epidemics are not transmitted from person to person but, rather, are the result of cellular toxicity, including but not limited to EMF-induced cellular toxicity.

To be clear, I’m not saying 5G spreads the infection or is a vector of infection. But by lowering your natural immune defenses and causing chronic inflammation, it is likely impairing your innate immune system’s ability to fight off the coronavirus. Naturally, this increased susceptibility to illness would apply to all disease, both acute and chronic, and would not be limited to COVID-19.

Exaggerated EMF exposure may well be a hidden variable that could be contributing to the reason why so many people get sick in particular areas. Intense EMF exposure could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back, meaning the factor that breaks the immune system. “[Cowan] is a top-notch doctor, he’s on the cutting edge,” Hoyer says. “In that video, he talks about Wuhan as one of the testing grounds for 5G, where 5G was first implemented in China. And what’s interesting about Italy … is that Milan — the Lombardi area of Italy where two-thirds of the cases are — is considered the 5G capital of the European Union according to Vodafone, which is the big 5G carrier out there …

If you go on Vodafone’s website, you can see the 5G map, and it’s sprinkled throughout all Milan and Lombardi, that province up there. So that is definitely a more concentrated area. On top of that, you have all of the older population in Italy, and people that are likely fully buying into the Western medicine and are on [multiple] medications — those sorts of things.

The way that all of those medications are interacting, combined with the 5G stress and the electromagnetic stress, I think it’s no wonder everyone’s immune system is suppressed and they’re so susceptible. It’s the terrain that’s the problem, the environmental stress.

We can actually kind of control that ourselves. Getting off of our phones and working to shield our environment will help to strengthen our immune system. Then taking some … supplements can take to help boost your immune system …

So, there’s 5G in Milan, in Wuhan, and New York City is one of the highest, most intense [5G] areas I’ve seen, and Seattle … But 5G doesn’t matter so much to me. It’s about the intensity of the EMF. New York was basically as intense as a 5G area already, before 5G was implemented, in my opinion. It maxes out all of our meters wherever I go. There are hidden antennas everywhere in New York City.

[Seattle] has a lot of hills in the city, and right on Queen Anne, there are two huge radio towers with probably 100 antennas on them, just blasting the whole city. We’ve had assessments there where we’ve maxed out [our meters], and even shielded rooms upstairs and it still maxed out.

So, we have to do a complete covering of the floor, the ceiling and the walls, and be really strict about how we’re doing the shielding over the windows so that everything is sealed almost perfectly, like a true perfect Faraday cage. In most homes we don’t have to do an absolutely perfect Faraday cage, with all the electrical connections and no gaps whatsoever. We can still dial it down to where the levels are low enough.

But in places where it’s really intense, we have to use different strategies in order to make it so that there’s absolutely no gaps … The exponential pressure of all that EMF radiation that can leak in through a tiny hole is really important in those more saturated areas …

Some people watching this will be like, ‘Oh, EMF is the cause of everything.’ That’s not what I’m saying at all. But it definitely weakens our immune systems. Martin Pall’s research shows one mechanism for how that happens and … we know how electric the body is.

I mean, the heart communicates with the brain through an electromagnetic pulse, that’s been proven with the HeartMath studies … You can [find] fascinating articles on there about how we physiologically depend on different voltage changes in order for our body to function optimally.

Just to think that there are people out there that believe this environment we’ve created does not affect us — it’s insane when you start to read some of these studies about how our body uses voltage to heal and to function.” I’ve published a series of suggestions on how to minimize your risk of COVID-19, including the use of sauna, nebulized hydrogen peroxide, vitamin C, ozone, melatonin and other nutraceuticals.

My favorite supplement of all, which I believe is particularly useful at this time, is molecular hydrogen tablets. The tablets are made of metallic magnesium, which when placed in water dissociates into magnesium ions, not a salt like magnesium oxide or magnesium threonate.

It’s just simple pure magnesium, which doesn’t have a laxative effect, and molecular hydrogen gas — both of which are extraordinarily useful for mitigating the negative effects and impacts of EMF.

I think almost everyone would benefit from them. The beautiful thing about molecular hydrogen is that it’s a selective antioxidant. Unlike most traditional antioxidants that indiscriminately reduce most free radicals, molecular hydrogen merely helps activate endogenous antioxidants to reduce the damage from the NRLP3 inflammasome activation.

The magnesium, meanwhile, acts as a calcium channel blocker, which helps mitigate the damage from the EMF exposure. So, it helps in many different ways. I think it’s one of the best strategies during this epidemic.

I recommend taking two tablets in water once a day (twice if you have heavy exposure either to COVID-19 or EMFs). Ideally, you want to pulse your intake, as consuming it regularly doesn’t seem to work as well. You need to pulse it to get the benefit because there needs to be a change in the concentration in your system.

As for lowering your EMF exposure, you can download a free chapter from my book, “EMF*D” that summarizes most of the major recommendations. I also review the most important considerations in “The No. 1 Thing to Do to Protect Yourself From EMFs.”

Hoyer is also working on videos demonstrating how to use shielded paint and other remediation strategies, so keep an eye out for those on his website, ShieldedHealing.com.

“Many are at home right now. You have time to do this. Our company stocked up on shielding paint before [the COVID-19 pandemic] so we don’t have to import it anymore. It would be a good time to take on a [remediation] project. Beyond that, things you can do right now is get off your cellphone. Your cellphone is a walking cellphone tower. I always have mine on airplane mode …” The most important area to shield is your bedroom, as that is where you spend your nights — the time when your body is going through its most valuable regeneration and healing processes. Sleeping in an EMF-free environment can go a long way toward avoiding electrosensitivity, which by the way tends to come on very rapidly, in many cases seemingly “overnight.”

Common symptoms of electromagnetic hypersensitivity include ringing in the ears, a feeling of burning or prickling in the skin, headache, heart palpitations and inexplicable anxiety, for example. Once you’re electrosensitive, additional and more extensive remediation strategies may become necessary.

Again, it may not be 5G per se that breaks down the immune system, but rather that the total EMF burden simply exceeds the tolerable threshold of many individuals.

“It involves a lot of detox of different heavy metals [and chemicals],” Hoyer explains.”There’s a chemical load, there’s heavy metal load. There’s all types of stressors that we need to reduce to make a person less electrosensitive. We’re getting more and more sensitive as a species and eventually we’ll hit a tipping point — perhaps once you add a virus that we’ve never had exposure to before …

You have to wonder, is this the tipping point? Not necessarily 5G? Is this virus and even 4G the tipping point? I wonder about that. I know 5G is adding more saturation of these frequencies, but we really need to get to a point where we understand that, at least in the bedroom, we need to be shielded. If you’re still reacting to things, you have to do more work.”

On 5G Frequencies
As explained by Hoyer, EMF shielding materials are capable of blocking about 99% of the harmful frequencies we’re exposed to, but not the lower frequencies associated with the Schumann resoAnonymousce, which are associated with healing. He also points out that:

“A lot of people equate 5G with millimeter waves (MMW). That’s absolutely not the case in my opinion. I’ve tested … frequencies all the way up to 23.5 gigahertz (GHz) with 3G and 4G as back haul transmitters. Satellite TV is 12 to 18 GH.

The 5G frequencies they’re going to be using, or are using in some areas, are point-to-point communication right now … it’s laser pointed. I had a meter that measured MMWs and I took it to Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.

I didn’t detect anything in Austin where 5G was live. In Los Angeles, there were some neighborhoods where I barely detected something, but I had to point my receiver directly at the antenna to get it. If I was even a centimeter off, I would not detect it.

So [5G antennas] are like laser pointed frequencies from what I can tell with the testing that I did. And most of the 5G frequencies we’re being exposed to are going to be below 6 GHz. That’s what’s going to be communicating with our devices if you choose to get a 5G device, which I would recommend not to do …

We have much more saturation, like in Houston, there’s 3.5 GHz on every telephone pole. That’s a higher frequency than 2.4 so it’s faster. Five GHz on your router is faster. Some people report more symptoms from 5 GHz router versus 2.4 GHz and vice versa. It seems to be frequency dependent.

What’s interesting is the lower the frequency, down to 50 or 60 megahertz (MHz), the more it resonates with the human body. The size of the human body you’re getting in around 60 to 80 MHz range is about 6 foot. That’s what your body will resonate with.

On any meter where I measure this, I measure it with a real-time spectrum analyzer. You can actually see the rise and you’re using your body as an antenna much more from about 60 MHz all the way up to around 900 MHz, sometimes in up to 1500 MHz you can still see this antenna effect on the body.

But the higher frequencies don’t resonate as much with the conductance of the skin. So, your skin does provide a slight Faraday cage against the higher frequencies, but these lower frequencies definitely penetrate, including T-Mobile’s 600 MHz 5G frequency, which goes further and can penetrate deeper into tissue and through forests and everything.”

What Will 42,000 Satellites Do to the Earth?
SpaceX, which currently has about 400 low-Earth orbiting satellites, has obtained permission to put 42,000 satellites into orbit in order to provide the whole world with 5G coverage. The exact ramifications of this saturation remain to be seen, but I’m not particularly optimistic. Hoyer comments:

“SpaceX has about 400 satellites up. That was the number Elon Musk wanted to start … testing the network. That could turn on at any time. So those of us out there who are electrosensitive are paying attention and reading the news on that.

Amazon … Facebook [and] companies in the U.K. and Canada also have petitions to put up satellites, so it’s not just SpaceX … But SpaceX is looking at doing 42,000 satellites. They just got approved by the government for 1 million antennas on the ground, to work with the satellites. That is what I’m much more concerned about than the stuff beaming down from above, because they’re closer …

I think a lot of people are very concerned. I almost see this apocalyptic look on people’s faces when we talk about the Starlink and the satellites … like we’re not going to be protected at all. It’s just going to be everywhere.

Well, I think that’s true, but even the satellite dishes that we have for television and cable, you have to have a dish that collects that signal and concentrates it up. So, they’re actually pretty weak signals coming from above. It’s not like they’re completely blasting you with a laser beam down.

But like I was saying, the 1 million antennas on the ground, that’s what I’m much more concerned about. And then the devices that we and our neighbors have, those are very concerning. If you have a metal roof, that’s going to protect you somewhat from a lot of the different frequencies that are beaming down … I’m much more concerned about the stuff that’s way closer to us.”

Compassion for Each Other Is Paramount
As noted by Hoyer, we need to have more compassion in general for those who are immune compromised. Clearly, they need to be protected from SARS-CoV-2. But they also need to be protected from wireless frequencies and EMF exposure, and few give this a single thought.

“Many of these older people grew up in an environment where they didn’t have nearly as much EMF exposure. There’s still some of these older people who grew up in places that didn’t even have electricity.

So, just thinking about the irony of that whole thing gives me this sense of wanting to have more compassion for our fellow man, and also the tragedy of the social distancing that we have as well. I would love to have a solution to remedy that, but I’m just going to keep trucking on and doing what I do best and help people.”",1,

“This is not a replacement for staying home and physical distancing, but it is an important step for safety.” The rule officially goes into effect on May 11 at 8 a.m. So, you have until then to make or purchase your face coverings. 

The mayor’s release also noted that “noncompliance is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.”

It is important to note that government officials state that children aged under two years old must not wear a face covering, as it is poses a choking hazard.

Children ages three through twelve are not required to wear a face covering. If they do, they must be supervised by an adult at all times.",1,

29,COVID-19 Update,BANKOL123,"Japan’s Nobel prize winning Professor of Medicine, Professor Dr Tasuku Honjo, created a sensation today by saying that the Coronavirus is not natural. “If it is natural, it wouldn’t have adversely affected the entire world like this. Because, as per nature, temperature is different in different countries. If it is natural, it would adversely affect only those countries having the same temperature as China. Instead, it is spreading in a country like Switzerland, in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. Whereas if it were natural, it would have spread in cold places, but died in hot places. I have done 40 years of research on animals and viruses. It is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory. I have been phoning them all, after the Coronavirus surfaced. But all their phones are dead for the last 3 months. It is now understood that all these lab technicians have died. Based on all my knowledge and research till date, I can say this with 100% confidence – That the Coronavirus is not natural.

222,The Tests: The Achilles Heel of the COVID-19 House of Cards,Dr. Pascal Sacré,"The tool is not the problem, it’s what we do with it.”

– Tests which are not reliable!
–  False negatives (real patients not detected).
– False positives (patients who are not positive)
– Tests that detect fragments of the virus and not the virus itself!
– Tests that don’t quantify the viral load, the most important thing…
– Test kits infected with the virus itself: you could catch it by getting tested!

So, you’ve been tested? Negative? Positive?

Maybe you’re like most people, eager to find out if you’ve got it or better yet, prove that you’re immune to the VID thing.

With this article, I don’t want to add a layer of fear to the pandemic of panic spread by our dear media in recent months.

Nevertheless, even if some people don’t want to “know anything” and will do whatever they are told to do [1]:

E.g. Wear a mask everywhere all the time, stay away from your family and friends, don’t dare to go out or take public transport without your “armour and visor”, don’t dare to touch anything without wearing gloves stuck to the skin as a result of sweating…  Etc.

I think that looking for more truth and getting closer to the truth is the best antidote to fear.

So, these tests! what are they

Introduction: Diagnosing COVID-19 disease

People confuse the disease with the agent accused of causing it.

COVID-19 refers to the disease characterized by “airway involvement” with a wide variety of symptom patterns (see below).

It is caused by a virus, SARS-CoV-2, of the coronavirus family [2], SARS for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

Another coronavirus of this type, SARS-CoV-1, had already occurred in 2003, less contagious but more dangerous (in terms of mortality). In summary

What a fiasco.

The diagnostic tests represented above all by RT-PCR, a gene amplification technique, are far from having the expected reliability, which is crucial in a crisis such as the one we are going through.

Even if positive, the RT-PCR test only reveals an RNA fragment of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, not the COVID-19 disease itself. In order to say that, we need a corresponding clinical picture! All other pathologies of the patient must be considered and if the patient dies, they must be taken into account before attributing death to COVID-19!

This is frightening when you imagine the possible unjustified consequences of decisions made on the basis of these tests!

– Confinement/quarantine
– Unprecedented freedom-destroying measures
–  Hospital and health centre upheavals
–  Serious diagnoses may be wrongly given to terrorized people who are actually in good health.
– Social distancing with heavy consequences on human relations
– Major economic and social impact, the real scope of which is currently unknown
–  Suspension of all social activities (schools, restaurants, leisure activities)
– Whole population tracking and policing projects

I think that in the face of so much self-sustained insanity, despite the widespread virus of fear, the best antidote is to stay calm.

Come to your senses.

Reassess the true extent of this disease (mortality below 3% [of positive cases] as of May 26, 2020- [20]).

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus will have to take its rightful place among all other health problems, no more, no less.

And we, may we quickly live again without masks, without social distance and without  laws which threaten civil rights.

And learn from so many mistakes.",1,
512,EasyJet weighs up empty middle seats once coronavirus rules ease | Business | The Guardian,"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kalyeena-makortoff,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwyntopham","EasyJet may keep middle seats empty to follow physical distancing rules once coronavirus travel restrictions are lifted, its chief executive has said. Johan Lundgren said vacant seats were one of the options being explored as the low-cost airline started planning for flights to resume, following the grounding of EasyJetâ€™s entire fleet on 30 March. The chief executive said a drop in passenger demand would make it easier to keep the middle seats empty when restrictions were eased. â€œOur assumption is that load factors will not be back to normal early on, which means that we will have the opportunity for a middle-seat option, but Iâ€™m talking about this as an initial phase and nobody knows how long that phase will be,â€ Lundgren said. â€œWeâ€™re also looking at various disinfection programmes on the aircraft.â€ However, the middle-seat option has been dismissed by the chief executive of its rival Ryanair, Michael Oâ€™Leary, who said it would be a â€œhopelessly ineffectiveâ€ way to keep passengers safe and ultimately unaffordable for airlines. EasyJet said winter bookings were â€œwell aheadâ€ of last year after it released its flight schedule earlier than usual. Some of those customers were rebooking flights cancelled following the Covid-19 outbreak. Customers have had the option of changing their flights without a fee, receiving credit for their flights, or a full refund. Nearly half had chosen alternative flights or flight credit, the airline said. EasyJet is now expecting a smaller loss for the first half of the year, of between Â£185m to Â£205m, compared with previous forecasts of Â£275m. It follows an emergency cost-cutting programme that included a hiring, promotion and pay freeze, a halt to all non-mandatory training, and cuts to its administrative budget. Of the airlineâ€™s 14,000 staff, all but 650 have been furloughed under government schemes across Europe. Lundgren said it was too soon to say when flights would get back to normal and how profits would be affected, but he said EasyJet had a dedicated data science team modelling various scenarios. â€œI think we just need to be very flexible in terms of how the programme would look, and then we need to see what the pricing will be at that point in time and the profitability of those flights,â€ the chief executive said. â€œBut I think thatâ€™s something we can only know once these restrictions are lifted and we can look at what the impact this will have on sales going forward. The answer to the question is nobody knows today what that means, but weâ€™re planning for a number of scenarios on how we will get back to the market.â€ EasyJet has enough cash reserves to survive another nine months without operating aircraft, according to a trading statement released on Thursday. Lundgren said he did not expect EasyJet to have to ask for state aid and suggested the airline would object if struggling competitors were given special assistance during the crisis. Virgin Atlantic has applied to the government for loans and guarantees worth up to Â£500m. However, he said the position would depend how long grounding persisted. â€œNo one, no one will be able to survive if it goes on for a huge period â€¦ So before one is saying youâ€™d never accept anything from this or that, it comes back to how long it goes on for. If itâ€™s 12-18 months, there wonâ€™t be a single company around.â€ Meanwhile, EasyJetâ€™s founder and biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, stepped up his attack on the airlineâ€™s management, calling for the sacking of Lundgren, as well as the chairman, John Barton, over a Â£4.5bn order of planes from Airbus. While EasyJet has deferred some deliveries to attempt to mitigate the cost, Haji-Ioannou said the contract should have been cancelled altogether and the number of aircraft in the fleet meant the airline would make heavy losses in 2021.",0,
403,Explainer: Zoom bombs make choosing video apps harder for lockdown chats - Reuters,"Supantha Mukherjee, Munsif Vengattil","(Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis has seen millions locked in their homes turn to videoconferencing apps, bringing with it question marks over security and privacy and a new verb - Zoombombing - the practice of uninvited users crashing into conversations. From easy-access models for schoolkids and casual users like House Party, Google Hangouts or Zoom to Ciscoâ€™s business-focused Webex, Microsoftâ€™s Teams or San Jose-based BlueJeans, the value and profile of these apps has soared. But which one would you choose and what are the risks? There have been two big social media-inspired scares since lockdowns and social distancing became widespread. People started uninstalling Houseparty in late March after messages on discussion boards and social media claimed that other apps on phones had been hacked after downloading its social chat platform. The company denied the claims and offered a reward of $1 million for evidence of what it said was a smear campaign. Zoom, which has soared to 200 million daily users from 10 million in less than three months, had multiple reports of â€œzoombombingâ€, where strangers barge into private calls having gained access to an invite or meeting number. Underlying many of the issues is the fact that Zoom has not  merely become more popular; with the world under lockdown, Zoom has transformed from a business-oriented teleconferencing tool to global video hangout. â€œNow Zoom is being used in situations where you invite strangers into video chat,â€ said former Facebook Inc Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now works with Zoom as an outside consultant. â€œThatâ€™s a big change.â€ This has snowballed into a bigger problem as security researchers found bugs in codes, user data sharing with Facebook, lack of end-to-end encryption and routing of some traffic through China. Stamos said the changes meant the company had to think about privacy and security differently. Security researchers draw a distinction between apps aimed at social interaction and ordinary consumers and those intended to keep communications private for a big corporation or a bank. They say that most â€œzoombombingâ€ incidents could have been avoided if meeting hosts had taken simple steps like requiring a password to join the chat and keeping invites to tighter groups. Zoom has since updated here its software and given hosts the ability to lock meetings, restrict what attendees can do and remove participants. It advises hosts to approve each participant before they join a particular chat and has removed here Facebook's access to data. â€œThe flaws are serious, make no mistake, but not unique or special in any way,â€ said Daniel Cuthbert, head of cyber security research at Grupo Banco Santander. â€œBut Zoom acted quickly and fixed the issues, which is not the norm in my experience and this should be applauded.â€ For corporate customers, however, the issue of encryption and who keeps records or can listen to your calls is more important, be it to safeguard valuable company information, or meet privacy obligations to customers. Zoom has brought in top industry figures to work on security and has already taken steps to allow users to rule out data passing through China, but it has also had to admit that it misled customers by saying earlier that its conversations were encrypted from end to end. Researchers say this may have been at the heart of a number of the bans on the app implemented by corporations and governments in the past month. â€œWhile the average user talking about their daily activities with their family over Zoom are probably fine, I would recommend sticking with the platforms created by more mature companies,â€ said Patrick Wardle, a security researcher with software company Jamf, who found two undisclosed flaws in the platform. A spokesman for Zoom, which has since patched those and other previously undiscovered flaws, said that big companies and government agencies globally have done exhaustive security reviews of its platform and many continue to use Zoom. Some companies offer here end-to-end encryption as an option but when it is enabled several features such as saving session data, call transcripts, call recording and calling from landlines are not supported. Cisco, which says it had 324 million attendees here in March, said its Webex sessions were encrypted. â€œWe donâ€™t go and take your data or transcribe what you are saying, and we donâ€™t sell your data to ad agencies. This is a proper tool for secure communication,â€ said Cisco senior vice president Jonathan Davidson. Microsoft Teams, with 44 millions users here and BlueJeans, which has 15,000 enterprise clients here also offer encryption options on their platforms. Symphony Communication, a messaging service backed by big banks, is planning an early summer launch of a video conferencing platform featuring end-to-end encryption, Chief Executive Officer David Gurle said.

336,Beer may lose its fizz as CO2 supplies go flat during pandemic - Reuters,"Stephanie Kelly, Lisa Baertlein","NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dwindling supplies of carbon dioxide from ethanol plants is sparking concern about shortages of beer, soda and seltzer water - essentials for many quarantined Americans. Brewers and soft-drink makers use carbon dioxide, or CO2, for carbonation, which gives beer and soda fizz. Ethanol producers are a key provider of CO2 to the food industry, as they capture that gas as a byproduct of ethanol production and sell it in large quantities. But ethanol, which is blended into the nationâ€™s gasoline supply, has seen production drop sharply due to the drop in gasoline demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gasoline demand is down by more than 30% in the United States. The lack of ethanol output is disrupting this highly specialized corner of the food industry, as 34 of the 45 U.S. ethanol plants that sell CO2 have idled or cut production, said Renewable Fuels Association Chief Executive Geoff Cooper. CO2 suppliers to beer brewers have increased prices by about 25% due to reduced supply, said Bob Pease, chief executive officer of the Brewers Association. The trade group represents small and independent U.S. craft brewers, who get about 45% of their CO2 from ethanol producers. â€œThe problem is accelerating. Every day weâ€™re hearing from more of our members about this,â€ said Pease, who expects some brewers to start cutting production in two to three weeks. In an April 7 letter to Vice President Mike Pence, the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) said production of CO2 had fallen about 20% and could be down by 50% by mid-April without relief, CGA CEO Rich Gottwald said in the letter. Meat producers are also feeling the pinch, as they use CO2 in processing, packaging, preservation and shipment. Orion Melehan, CEO of Santa Cruz, California-based LifeAID, a specialty beverage company, said two of his production partners are looking for alternative CO2 sources. â€œIt does have us up at night figuring out what our options are,â€ Melehan said. â€œIt highlights the laws of unintended consequences.â€ A spokeswoman for National Beverage Corp, whose products include LaCroix, said the company sources from a number of national CO2 suppliers and does not anticipate a supply issue. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), SodaStream owner PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O), wine and beer seller Constellation Brands Inc (STZ.N) and several bottling companies did not respond to requests for comment Walker Modic, environmental and social sustainability manager for Bellâ€™s Brewery, said the Comstock, Michigan-based brewing company had â€œnot experienced any curtailments or changes in the source of our CO2.â€ Reporting by Stephanie Kelly in New York, Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",0,
534,Coronavirus update: Neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms to look for  | Express.co.uk,Adam Chapman," Coronavirus has been met with a string of countermeasures since it first arrived in the UK in late January. The lockdown, which has just been extended to May 7, has been the government's most decisive measure to date, and evidence suggests it is bearing fruit. The fatality rate in the UK appears to be dropping, with England recording its lowest daily death count today (405) since the beginning of April. Despite the green shoots, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is resisting calls to relax the lockdown measures, for fear that a second wave of infection could strike if the UK acts prematurely. The same can be said for staying alert to the warning signs of the virus. The NHS identifies the main symptoms as a high temperature and a new, continuous cough, so if you do not recognise these warning signs, you may be under the impression that you have not come into contact with COVID-19. However, there are a number of additional symptoms that can occur without respiratory-related issues. READ MORE: Coronavirus update: Dr Hilary says plasma treatment for COVID-19 is â€˜very promisingâ€™  According to Harvard Health, people with COVID-19 are also experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or both. As the health body explains, these may occur with or without respiratory symptoms. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness or tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, notes the health site. Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain or discomfort have been reported in patients with COVID-19, it says.

According to the NHS, if you are self-isolating, you must: ""You can use your garden, if you have one. Any exercise should be taken at home,"" says the health site.  According to official health advice, if you have symptoms of coronavirus, you'll need to self-isolate for seven days. After seven days: You do not need to self-isolate if you just have a cough after seven days, however. The NHS explains: ""A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.""  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

307,"Modern Governance 9.0: Facing New Pressures, 65% of Board Directors Seek Outside Sources of Intel to Inform Company Guidance, Diligent Institute Report Shows",,"In an era of increased scrutiny, corporate directors are independently mining outside sources of information beyond the reports supplied from within their companies, according to a new Diligent Institute report. The Diligent Institute is the research arm of Diligent, a leader in modern governance and a trusted provider of board insights to over 17,000 organizations and 650,000 leaders worldwide. The report, titled Beyond the Board Room: How Directors Gain Insight, included insights from nearly 200 board directors around the globe. According to the poll, 65% of directors spend time gathering independent information about their companies to prepare for board meetings and 40% of their preparation is spent on activities other than reading management-prepared materials. In todays fast paced world, directors are held to higher standards and are under more pressure than ever before, and theyre developing new tactics to meet the demands of their role, said Diligent CEO Brian Stafford. Our research puts a finer point on the expanded scope of the director role, and the resources they need to help executives make informed decisions for the company to maintain its competitive advantage. Directors need information from a diversity of reliable sources, and companies should help them by establishing best practices that ensure the external sources are credible. According to the report, directors read up on industry trends, governance best practices, and speak with other corporate leaders in their efforts to gain insight. The survey revealed that 79% of directors have conversations with other board members, and 87% converse with management team members in advance of board meetings. With new global risks like the Covid-19 coronavirus and resulting stock market volatility impacting companies, the pressure on directors to consider perspectives from multiple sources â€œboth inside and outside the company â€œ has never been greater. As one survey respondent remarked, Youre being irresponsible if youre not looking more widely to understand whats happening in your sector rather than relying solely on CEO reports. Especially in todays high-risk culture, when youre assessing risk all of the time, if you just looked at one source, you wouldnt be doing your job properly. While this new form of due diligence can arm board members with better information, it can also open up potential risks, of particular concern to general counsels and other legal professionals within the company. At times, outside research can be incomplete, outdated, or just incorrect, creating confusion among board members. To combat this, it is critical to establish processes and empower board members with technology that enables them to be proactive while ensuring they are using credible, reliable sources to mitigate risk in an increasingly digital world. Keeping up with the pace of change and disruption is an incredible challenge and opportunity. For board members, it means we must stay sharp and have our pulse on the changing competitive landscape so we can help our companies see around corners and make the best decisions for shareholders and stakeholders alike, said Erin Lantz, board member with TrueCar. Having access to a breadth of information, from both management and independent sources, helps to develop a more complete picture of the company and a better ability to identify risks and opportunities. Overall, the report findings could significantly impact the way management helps prepare directors for board meetings and the tools they provide to guide them. With directors focusing on outside research, there needs to be a more careful focus on the type of information delivered to boards and improved tools and protocols to ensure theyre reviewing reliable and relevant material to make educated decisions.

319,"Coronavirus PANIC: UK to BAN China visitors to stop virus as 3,000 remain stuck on cruise | World | News | Express.co.uk",Carly Read," Travel restrictions may include turning away any passenger who has visited China - or the infected city of Wuhan where the disease has spawned - in the past 14 days. Briton David Abel is one of the 3,000 passengers trapped on the Diamond Princess, who has become somewhat of a national celebrity for his colourful updates as 10 passengers have since tested positive for the killer bug. With the worldwide death toll now 500, hospitals have been told to create â€œpriority assessment podsâ€ for people with suspected coronavirus. The Government said it was unlikely the new travel restrictions would come into play until next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will this evening chair an emergency COBRA meeting. It comes as a third person in the UK has tested positive for coronavirus, Britainâ€™s Chief Medical Officer has said. Professor Chris Whitty said the person, who contracted the virus in Asia but not in mainland China, is currently being transferred to an infectious diseases centre for treatment. Prof Whitty did not say which country the patient was in when they caught coronavirus, or whether it was caught directly from someone who had been in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak.   The patient is thought to have been diagnosed in Brighton and is being transferred to Guyâ€™s and St Thomasâ€™ in London, where there is an infectious diseases unit. Two other patients are still being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary infectious diseases centre in Newcastle upon Tyne. In a statement, Prof Whitty said: â€œThe patient is being transferred to a specialist NHS centre, and we are using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus. â€œThe NHS is well prepared to manage these cases and we are now working quickly to identify any contacts the patient has had.â€ The University of Sussex, which has a large campus on the outskirts of Brighton, said in a statement the new case was not a student or member of staff from the university. READ NOW: Coronavirus symptoms: THESE people are less susceptible [NEWS]  Health officials are not understood to be â€œcontact tracingâ€ people on any Asia-UK flight the latest coronavirus sufferer may have travelled on. The Government has also announced that people with recent travel to a number of countries in Asia who are back in the UK and develop symptoms should immediately self-isolate and call NHS 111 for advice. Until now, this advice only related to people from Wuhan in China. Anyone with symptoms will be tested for coronavirus. Prof Whitty said: â€œWe knew this ratchet up might well happen and this is the moment where we feel itâ€™s prudent to make this shift.â€ He said: â€œWhat we have got is a situation where very high risk remains in Wuhan and Hubei, a high risk in the rest of China, but much lower than in Wuhan and Hubei and then a much smaller risk in a number of countries, and unsurprisingly countries where the greatest risk is in terms of new cases are the ones which have the greatest international traffic with China, and that is exactly as you would expect.â€ DON'T MISS: Coronavirus: Did Nostradamus predict the deadly China virus?

334,Virgin Australia: Richard Branson says his airlines will collapse without government help - CNN,"Hanna Ziady, CNN Business","London (CNN Business) Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia will need government support if they're to survive the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Billionaire founder Richard Branson said Monday that the airlines need money from the UK and Australian governments to keep going ""in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today,"" including the lack of clarity over how long planes will have to remain grounded. In an open letter to employees, Branson said the survival of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia was important to provide much needed competition to British Airways, an IAG ( ICAGY ) subsidiary, and Qantas ( QABSY ) . ""If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies,"" he noted. Branson, who has already pumped $250 million into Virgin Group companies in response to the pandemic, said he would offer his Necker Island estate in the Caribbean as collateral ""to raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible around the group."" Boeing won't be returning to 'normal' anytime soon Virgin Atlantic will seek a commercial loan from the UK government, which it will repay, Branson added, without giving details of how much money it needs. Read More ""The reality of this unprecedented crisis is that many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it. Without it there won't be any competition left and hundreds of thousands more jobs will be lost, along with critical connectivity and huge economic value,"" he said. Travel bans and nationwide lockdowns have brought global aviation almost to a standstill, prompting dozens of airlines to ground planes and place workers on unpaid leave . The International Air Transport Association said last week that airline passenger revenues will be cut in half this year, tumbling by $314 billion from 2019. Lufthansa ( DLAKY ) , one of Europe's biggest airline groups, is permanently reducing the size of its fleet and shutting down one of its low-cost carriers, warning that the aviation sector will take years to recover from the crisis. United says demand for travel is 'essentially zero' and signals layoffs While US airlines will receive tens of billions of dollars in support as part of the country's $2 trillion stimulus package, governments in Europe have not promised wholesale bailouts to their carriers. Instead, individual airlines are tapping government support to pay staff salaries and raise debt. Budget carrier EasyJet ( ESYJY ) said earlier this month that it had raised Â£600 million ($746.6 million) through the UK government's Covid Corporate Financing Facility. The government said it will consider the situation of firms on a case-by-case basis. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have furloughed some 38,000 staff between them and are relying on the government to pay 80% of these employees' wages. A spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic said the airline is ""exploring all available options to obtain additional external funding."" The airline declined to comment on a Financial Times report that it had been told to resubmit its proposal for a Â£500 million ($622.2 million) coronavirus loan because the UK government was not satisfied with its initial bid. Virgin Group operates in many of the sectors that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, including aviation, leisure, hotels and cruises. ""The challenge right now is that there is no money coming in and lots going out,"" Branson said. The company employs 70,000 people in 35 countries. Branson has been criticized for seeking help from the government when he does not pay UK income tax because his primary residence is on Necker Island, which he bought when he was 29. He addressed the criticism in his letter, saying that he and his wife Joan ""did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island."" Virgin companies paid tax in the United Kingdom, he said. â€” Eoin McSweeney contributed reporting.",0,
45,"Who Made Coronavirus? Was It the U.S., Israel or China?",Philip Giraldi,"he most commonly reported mainstream media account of the creation of the Coronavirus suggests that it was derived from an animal borne microorganism found in a wild bat that was consumed by an ethnic Chinese resident of Wuhan. But there appears to be some evidence to dispute that in that adjacent provinces in China, where wild bats are more numerous, have not experienced major outbreaks of the disease. Because of that and other factors, there has also been considerable speculation that the Coronavirus did not occur naturally through mutation but rather was produced in a laboratory, possibly as a biological warfare agent.

Several reports suggest that there are components of the virus that are related to HIV that could not have occurred naturally. If it is correct that the virus had either been developed or even produced to be weaponized it would further suggest that its escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology Lab and into the animal and human population could have been accidental. Technicians who work in such environments are aware that “leaks” from laboratories occur frequently.

There is, of course and inevitably, another theory. There has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has been constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global competitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and economic domiAnonymousce, it might be possible that Washington has created and unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing’s growing economy and military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to believe that even the Trump White House would do something so reckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior. In 2005-9 the American and Israeli governments secretly developed a computer virus called Stuxnet, which was intended to damage the control and operating systems of Iranian computers being used in that country’s nuclear research program. Admittedly Stuxnet was intended to damage computers, not to infect or kill human beings, but concerns that it would propagate and move to infect computers outside Iran proved to be accurate as it spread to thousands of PCs outside Iran, in countries as far flung as China, Germany, Kazakhstan and Indonesia.

Inevitably there is an Israeli story that just might shed some light on what has been going on in China. Scientists at Israel’s Galilee Research Institute are now claiming that they will have a vaccine against coronavirus in a few weeks which will be ready for distribution and use within 90 days. The institute is claiming that it has been engaged in four years of research on avian coronavirus funded by Israel’s Ministries of Science & Technology and Agriculture. They are claiming that the virus is similar to the version that has infected humans, which has led to breakthroughs in development through genetic manipulation, but some scientists are skeptical that a new vaccine could be produced so quickly to prevent a virus that existed only recently. They also have warned that even if a vaccine is developed it would normally have to be tested for side effects, a process that normally takes over a year and includes using it on infected humans. If one even considers it possible that the United States had a hand in creating the coronavirus at what remains of its once extensive biological weapons research center in Ft Detrick Maryland, it is very likely that Israel was a partner in the project. Helping to develop the virus would also explain how Israeli scientists have been able to claim success at creating a vaccine so quickly, possibly because the virus and a treatment for it were developed simultaneously.

In any event, there are definite political ramifications to the appearance of the coronavirus, and not only in China. In the United States President Donald Trump is already being blamed for lying about the virus and there are various scenarios in mainstream publications speculating over the possible impact on the election in 2020. If the economy sinks together with the stock market, it will reflect badly on Trump whether or not he is actually at fault. If containment and treatment of the disease itself in the United States does not go well, there could also be a considerable backlash, particularly as the Democrats have been promoting improving health care. One pundit argues, however, that disease and a sinking economy will not matter as long as there is a turnaround before the election, but a lot can happen in the next eight months.

And then there is the national security/foreign policy issue as seen from both Jerusalem and Washington. It is difficult to explain why coronavirus has hit one country in particular other than China very severely. That country is Iran, the often-cited enemy of both the U.S. and Israel. The number of Iran’s coronavirus cases continues to increase, with more positive tests confirmed among government officials last Saturday. There were 205 new coronavirus cases, bringing the government claimed total to 593 with 43 fatalities, though unofficial hospital reports suggest that the deaths are actually well over 100. That’s the highest number of deaths from the virus outside of China.

No less than five Iranian Members of Parliament have also tested positive amid a growing number of officials that have contracted the disease. Iran’s vice president Masoumeh Ebtekar and deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi had also previously been confirmed with the virus.

The usual suspects in the United States are delighted to learn of the Iranian deaths. Mark Dubowitz, Executive Director of the Washington-based but Israeli government connected Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) boasted on twitterTuesday that “Coronavirus has done what American economic sanctions could not: shut down non-oil exports.” An Iranian government spokesman responded that “It’s shameful and downright inhuman to cheer for a deadly Virus to spread – and enjoy seeing people suffer for it…” Dubowitz followed up with an additional taunt, that Tehran has “spread terrorism” in the Middle East and “now it’s spreading the coronavirus.”

So, you have your choice. Coronavirus occurred naturally, or it came out of a lab in China itself or even from Israel or the United States. If one suspects Israel and/or the United States, the intent clearly would have been to create a biological weapon that would damage two nations that have been designated as enemies. But the coronavirus cannot be contained easily and it is clear that many thousands of people will die from it. Unfortunately, as with Stuxnet, once the genie is out of the bottled it is devilishly hard to induce it to go back in.",1,

366,Hospital leaders hit out at government as PPE shortage row escalates | Society | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deniscampbell,"Hospital leaders have directly attacked the government for the first time during the coronavirus crisis over the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) after a desperately needed consignment of surgical gowns that had been announced by ministers failed to arrive. In an unprecedented intervention, which hospital leaders privately say is the result of â€œintense frustration and exasperationâ€, the organisations representing NHS trusts in England urged ministers to â€œjust focus on what we can be certain ofâ€ after weeks of â€œbitter experienceâ€ with failed deliveries. The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers spoke out amid continuing alarm that shortages of equipment will soon have disastrous effects on the frontline, with representatives of intensive care staff warning on Sunday that the critical shortage of PPE could lead to some people refusing to continue working there. After the Guardian revealed on Friday that doctors and nurses had been asked to work without protective full-length coverings and to instead resort to aprons, cabinet minister Robert Jenrick promised that 84 tonnes of PPE, including 400,000 much needed surgical gowns, would arrive from Turkey on Sunday. World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers â€“ not the public. â€œWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,â€ the WHO has stated. There is no robust scientific evidence â€“ in the form of trials â€“ that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces. Also underlying the WHOâ€™s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers. Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them. Sarah Boseley Health editor But after that shipment was delayed without explanation, hospital chiefsâ€™ frustrations boiled over. â€œTensâ€ of trusts are now at risk of running out of gowns over the next few days unless fresh supplies can be found, a well-placed NHS source said. After previous examples of promises of shipments that either did not arrive or contained the wrong items, NHS Providers â€“ the representative body for hospital trusts â€“ wants ministers including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to stop talking about expected deliveries in public and only announce them once they have arrived. Shipments trailed in advance that do not arrive increase anxiety among frontline staff and make it harder for hospitals to plan how best to keep their doctors and nurses from getting infected, bosses said. â€œWe have, over the last 24 hours, seen an unhelpful focus on one individual consignment coming from Turkey. We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, [and] when,â€ said Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers. â€œGiven the current uncertainties over gown manufacture and supply, due to global shortages, we suggest that any future announcements on what gowns might be available for delivery, when, just focus on what we can be certain of.â€ â€œBitter experience in recent weeks has shown that promised consignments of gowns cannot be relied on until they come, are checked and found to contain the right kit,â€ he added. â€œFor example, a consignment of 200,000 gowns that arrived from China last week actually contained only 20,000 gowns. This follows previous instances of consignments of gowns being mislabelled and failing safety tests.â€ Trust leaders privately admit that they are desperate to acquire more full-length waterproof surgical gowns. Hospitals have expressed gratitude to local vets, fire brigades, police forces, councils, DIY shops and buildersâ€™ merchants after being forced to ask them to hand over their stocks of gowns. One received 2,000 from a nearby veterinary supply firm. On Friday Hancock told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee that 55,000 more gowns were due that day. They arrived as expected and were distributed to hospitals over the weekend. However, NHS officials pointed out that, with hospital staff in England using 150,000 gowns a day, they constituted barely eight hoursâ€™ supply. London hospitals are getting through 30,000 to 40,000 a day and major teaching hospital trusts, such as Addenbrookeâ€™s in Cambridge and University Hospitals Birmingham need to use 3,000 to 4,000 each day, such is the demand caused by the pandemic. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which also represents hospital trusts and other NHS providers, said the non-arrival of PPE from Turkey was â€œvery seriousâ€ and made a difficult situation worse. â€œIt would have been better had the government not made the announcement in the first place,â€ he said. â€œWe know shipments in this supply chain are unreliable and even when they do arrive they are not always what is expected. In future the NHS will expect announcements when supplies have arrived, not promises about what may or may not be delivered.â€ Echoing Hopsonâ€™s concern, Dickson added that unfulfilled promises from ministers about PPE caused problems. â€œWe accept that this is difficult for everyone, but we now need action, not words. There was already a loss of confidence and real anxiety across the NHS and care system around PPE supply. This will have been further eroded by what has happened this weekend. It will not be restored until we have a stable supply chain and certainty that staff will be given what they need when they need it. At the moment we are a long way from that point.â€ As the number of NHS staff who have died from coronavirus rose to 77, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, leader of the British Medical Association, said: â€œThis really is a matter of life and death. In what is an incredibly challenging time, doctors and healthcare staff should feel as equipped and supported as they need to be able to deliver care for patients. Instead, they are left fearful for their own health and safety â€“ this is shameful.â€ The Intensive Care Society, Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, Royal College of Anaesthetists and Association of Anaesthetists joined a growing medical backlash against new PPE guidelines issued by Public Health England on Friday. In a joint statement, they said concern about lack of PPE was so great that some doctors may decide not to take the risk of treating infected patients. They said that, given the flaws in PHEâ€™s advice, â€œWe think clinicians should carefully evaluate the risks before taking a decision about whether to provide care, and should discuss a decision not to provide care with a colleague. â€œIf shortages continue or worsen, our members will face increasingly difficult decisions. This will involve balancing the safety of patients against their personal safety and that of other staff, those they return home to after work, and patients they may treat in the future.â€ A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: â€œWe are working round the clock given the global shortage of gowns and other PPE to secure the NHS and the social care sector the equipment they need.â€",0,
22,"Q: It's Here! Martial Law Coronavirus, National Lockdown, Police State and Mandatory Quarantines! (Video)",Anonymous,"THE REAL AGENDA REVEALED!!! As of Tues. Mar. 10th, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the closure of schools and other gathering places within a one-mile radius in the New York suburb known as New Rochelle. This is the starting point for “containment zones” that will be enforced for two weeks, keeping about half the city’s 10,500 students at home — And, even worse, allowing for the National Guard to “sanitize public spaces.” Not only that, but due to the spreading of this alleged “coronavirus outbreak,” Italy imposed unprecedented national restrictions on its 60 million people as “precautionary measures against the spread of COVID-19”…

A national lockdown is now in place in Italy, wherein public gatherings are banned (ranging from weddings, funerals, sporting events, and religious services), travel is only allowed for urgent work or emergencies or health reasons, and public places such as restaurants are operating on limited hours. Schools and universities remain closed, and this national lockdown in Italy is to remain in place until Apr. 3rd, 2020. But Is “Coronavirus” REALLY An Outbreak? According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and also the Worldometer, as of right now, more people in the U.S. alone die from heart disease WITHIN HALF AN HOUR than the confirmed number of coronavirus death cases in the U.S. over the past 3-4 weeks..

So if it’s a statistical FACT that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and that, more people have died from heart disease in the U.S. over the past THREE DAYS than coronavirus deaths total WORLDWIDE — What Is The BIGGER Agenda? WHO Benefits? Considering that the World Health Organization (WHO) is pushing for a cashless society due to the “coronavirus outbreak”…

Is this alleged “outbreak” no different than the common cold? And could this “pandemic” be nothing more than an elaborate HOAX? With quarantines, national lockdowns, and building blocks for martial law already in place all over the world, the question is, could mandatory vaccinations and civil police states be NEXT?!!

Sainz enjoyed a strong debut season with McLaren in 2019 and picked up his first F1 podium finish in the process. The Spaniard will be eager to build on those eye-catching performances over the course of the 2020 campaign, the start of which has been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. McLaren are eager to keep hold of the former Toro Rosso and Renault ace but his contract expires over the winter and he will be free to leave if he does not sign a new one. Ferrari have got Sainz on their radar of possible new partners for Charles Leclerc in case Vettel walks away when his own deal expires at the end of the coming season. The 25-year-old is taking no notice of the speculation surrounding his future, though, with McLaren his sole focus. READ MORE: The latest on Sebastian Vettel's contract situation at Ferrari  ""It is human to feel good when people in your sector recognise your work and value what you are doing,"" Sainz told Spanish newspaper Marca. ""There are many drivers whose contracts finish this year and rumours will always arise. ""I think everyone knows how happy I am at McLaren, I have great confidence in the project and in the human group behind it. When I signed the contract last summer I knew I had a major challenge ahead. ""McLaren was far from its best moment and I had to lead the team and do my best to develop a good car. I think that the team and myself lived up to that challenge and took an important step in 2019.

433,Riverdale season 4: Major coronavirus delay confirmed by writer | TV & Radio | Showbiz & TV | Express.co.uk,Lucas Hill-Paul,"  The glossy and unpredictable teen series has been continuing around the world on Netflix and The CW. As Riverdaleâ€™s production gets halted by the coronavirus, one writer for the series has dropped some major clues for when fans will finally get to see the new episodes.    Television production around the world has been postponed due to the ongoing uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic. Riverdale was among the first series to confirm major delays to its filming schedule, as it was confirmed a member of the showâ€™s team had come into contact with someone who had the virus. Luckily, much of the compelling fourth season had already wrapped, and dedicated viewers finally discovered the secret behind the supposed murder of Jughead Jones (played by Cole Sprouse). Unfortunately, after the showâ€™s latest brassy Broadway adaptation aired on Netflix, fans have another long hiatus ahead of them before the mysteries continue. READ MORE: Riverdale spoilers: Will Archie find new romance? Star teases scene    Despite episode 18â€™s release date being confirmed for next week, the subsequent chapter, Killing Mr Honey, has yet to receive a confirmed time slot. To quell the ongoing slew of rumours, writer for the series Ted Sullivan recently took to Twitter to assure fans there were still plans in place for as yet unseen new episodes. Moreover, one fan also asked the TV writer whether fan favourite character Toni Topaz (Vanessa Morgan) would finally get the focus she deserves in the ongoing season. Ted responded: â€œThe pandemic derailed production & there was a heavy Toni episode coming up. We'll still do it, but you'll have to now wait for season five instead of season four.     â€œSeason four is unfortunately now shorter, ending with episode 19 (which I wrote with James DeWille & directed by MÃ¤dchen Amick). But it has a fun cliffhanger!â€ Former Twin Peaks star and Bettyâ€™s mother on the series will take on directing duties for the tantalising season finale. Amid this distressing news for Riverdaleâ€™s fourth season, another fan pressed Ted Sullivan on whether episodes 20-22 will eventually surface. The writer confirmed: â€œYes! This season will continue for two more episodes! Episode 18 is a really awesome one by Ariana Jackson & Brian E. Paterson. So creepy & cool. DON'T MISS: Lucifer: Tom Ellis stalls season 6 with contract dispute [INSIGHT]Killing Eve season 3 theories: Carolyn â€˜revealedâ€™ as assassin by clue [INTERVIEW]Rick and Morty theories: Citadel makes shocking return [THEORY]   â€œAnd James DeWille & I wrote episode 19, which builds to a fun cliffhanger that will make you clamor for season five (with 20-22 starting that)! Airdates soon!â€ Ted's comments confirm what was originally intended as season fourâ€™s cataclysmic climax will now open the fifth season of the hair-raising high school drama. Season fourâ€™s episode 17, Wicked Little Town, adapted acclaimed musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch to the small screen, with mixed responses from fans. While the episode was praised for its LGBTQ positivity, other fans believed the musical was derailed by a lurid affair between Archie (KJ Apa) and Betty (Lili Reinhart).   Meanwhile, episode 18 will be titled Lynchian, and appears to be drawing from star MÃ¤dchen Amickâ€™s roots on David Lynchâ€™s innovative TV series from the 1990s, Twin Peaks. Fans are hoping the finale two episodes of this season will finally uncover the culprit behind the sinister videotapes plaguing the small townâ€™s happy households. However, a David Lynch-inspired episode kicking off the penultimate chapter of Riverdale season four could spell even more mysteries to come. Riverdale season four continues April 29 on Netflix.

202,"How To Protect Yourself From Coronavirus (Or Any Virus)
",Sally Fallon Morell,"With coronavirus dominating the news, we’ve seen a contagion of conspiracy theories—coronavirus is a bio-weapon invented by the Chinese, coronavirus lingers on paper money so governments are going to decree a cashless society, coronavirus has given the Italian and Iranian governments an excuse to crack down on dissidents, coronavirus is caused by 5G, which was rolled out in Wuhan—and outbreaks of worst-case-scenario thinking, like the claim that coronavirus will infect 80 percent of the UK population!


A few facts about coronavirus should help prevent panic. Coronavirus has been around a long time.  Both SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are caused by a type of coronavirus.  Like all viral outbreaks, they have their day and then taper off—as the number of cases already seems to be dwindling in China.

The number of deaths from coronavirus is low compared with the number of daily deaths from flu and pneumonia—and most of these occur in nursing homes and among the elderly. To date, no child has died of coronavirus. The worst part of all the hullaballoo is the bad advice that fills the newspaper reports. People are engaging in extreme handwashing, disinfecting their houses with clorox, refusing handshakes and wearing masks. (Remember that viruses are extremely tiny, so wearing a mask is like building a chain link fence to keep out mice.) We don’t read anything in the papers about building immunity—to all diseases, from coronavirus to TB.  In fact, the Washington Post has admonished its readers that you can’t build immunity to the coronavirus.

This is nonsense.  Like any virus, coronavirus is no match for someone with a strong immune system. Here are ways you can bolster yours:

PS: How do you know you have coronavirus?  In the papers we are reading that so-and-so tested positive to coronavirus.  What is this test? Apparently, there is no specific test for coronavirus!  According to one activist who spoke with an official at the CDC, doctors are simply doing a test for respiratory illness and fever, and linking that with recent travel to diagnose coronavirus. Seems like a lot of folks might just have the regular flu or pneumonia but get included in the coronavirus statistics instead.

PPS:  What about the effects of 5G—the next generation mobile communication networks that telecommunication companies are installing in major cities?  Could this be causing coronavirus?  5G negatively affects oxygen levels in the blood and depresses the immune system, so exposure to 5G could definitely make you more susceptible to illness, especially to respiratory illness. Try to avoid exposure as much as possible and to those for whom exposure is unavoidable, the immune-strengthening recommendations listed above offer critical protection.

PPPS: Coronavirus vaccine anyone?  Naturally a vaccine is in the works, and it will be fast tracked with little safety testing.  The Chinese developed a SARS vaccine but when they gave it to baboons, they dropped dead after exposure to the coronavirus while the unvaccinated baboons survived. One study has indicated that those who get the flu vaccine are more susceptible to coronavirus [Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012 Jun 15; 54(12): 1778–1783].  So, as always, vaccines are not the answer. Just drink raw milk and eat delicious pate and caviar instead.",1,

522,Coronavirus news: Major panic erupts amid fears REAL death tally for virus is revealed | World | News | Express.co.uk,Grace MacRae," A death tally published by Chinese web giant Tencent has sparked a huge online debate over the true number of coronavirus victims after the website briefly displayed a death toll in the thousands. Many fear the true number of victims of the deadly coronavirus could be much higher than official statistics show. On Saturday evening Tencent posted on its virus tracker website that the confirmed number of cases, suspected cases, and deaths were far higher than the official tally. However, the statistics were quickly deleted from the site and were updated just minutes later to reflect official government numbers. Taiwan News recently reported that Tencentâ€™s virus tracker website that the confirmed number of cases was registered at 154,023 â€“ more than 10 times higher than the official figure at the time. According to the publication, the number of suspected cases was almost 80,000. This comes in at around four times the official government figure. However, the most shocking find was the alarming increase of the death toll posted on the site.   JUST IN: Royal fury: Prince Andrew Union Jack celebration causes huge row The publication added: â€œMost ominously, the death toll listed was 24,589. â€œVastly higher than the 300 officially listed that day.â€ The site was updated just minutes later to reflect official government numbers. However, web users noted this wasnâ€™t the first time such a mistake had been made by the tech giant. In fact, users noted this was the third time such a correction had been made.  This lead to a huge amount of concern, with some users speculating number of cases is being deliberately concealed. However, others may put it down to a coding problem that caused such a spike in figures. As of today official statistics show 24,631 cases of the virus have been recorded with 493 deaths and 1,030 people recovered. However, multiple sources from inside Wuhan have raised doubts about the official figures including those working on the medical front lines.

507,"Don't forget sex workers in virus fight, Dominican Republic lawmaker says - Reuters",Oscar Lopez,"SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Dominican Republicâ€™s sex workers, especially transgender women, must be included in the nationâ€™s coronavirus relief efforts, given the impact on their livelihoods under tourism restrictions, a top lawmaker said on Thursday. Sex workers on the Caribbean island are uniquely vulnerable to contracting coronavirus as well because their work depends upon close physical interactions with clients, Jacqueline Montero, a congresswoman with the opposition Modern Revolutionary Party told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Adult prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic, and the country is known as a hot spot for sex tourism. But in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the government suspended commercial flights and ships, as well as closing schools and entertainment venues, as of Thursday. The island of palm trees and beaches attracts about 6 million visitors a year that help drive its economy. â€œIâ€™m very worried for the (sex worker) population. Most of them are in public places, so theyâ€™re more at risk,â€ Montero said. Government authorities â€œneed to give them some kind of food aid so that theyâ€™ll at least have something to eat,â€ she told the Foundation following a news conference the previous day with local reporters. The virus has spread quickly across Latin America and the Caribbean, where records show at least 1,000 cases reported across the region. At least 21 infections and one death have been reported in the Dominican Republic, where Senate lawmakers on Wednesday approved a 25-day state of emergency to deal with the crisis. An estimated 100,000 women are sex workers on the island, according to local advocates. â€œIf today they have to stop working for 25 days, what are they going to live on?â€ Montero said. â€œThey work today to be able to eat tomorrow.â€ An estimated one in five is a transgender women who will have an even more challenging time during the unfolding crisis because they struggle with abuse and discrimination, she said. â€œItâ€™s harder for them. Even during the day they are almost not on the streets, in the parks. They are only out at night,â€ she said. Up to 12% of female sex workers on the island are also HIV+, making them particularly vulnerable to health complications if infected with the coronavirus, she added.

299,US governors and coronavirus: who has responded best and worst? | US news | The Guardian,"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-strauss,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maanvi-singh","Americaâ€™s governors are playing an outsized role in day-to-day life across the country, and have emerged on the frontlines of efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. At times they are the voices offering the starkest contrast to Donald Trumpâ€™s wildly inconsistent statements, at other times they have been the most popular targets of criticism for how they are responding to the virus. Who is state governor has been one of the most important factors in how each state has responded to the pandemic: moving quickly to shutdowns and stay-at-home orders, or not moving at all: with high-stakes consequences. â€œThis is a defining moment for every governor in America because this isnâ€™t a moment where you just cast a vote and go home,â€ the veteran Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who has advised governors and gubernatorial candidates, said. â€œGovernors are in charge of making these life and death decisions right now.â€ Strategist Mike DuHaime, a veteran consultant to Republican governors and gubernatorial candidates, said the coronavirus pandemic was a rare crisis in which every governor has to respond. â€œYouâ€™re not looking at two or three governors dealing with a crisis, youâ€™re looking at all 50,â€ DuHaime said. Below is a list of 10 of the most visible governors during the pandemic: Critics blame Edwards, a Democrat, for allowing Mardi Gras festivities to go ahead, which epidemiologists say may have accelerated the spread of disease. But Edwards has earned praise for his bipartisan efforts â€“ uniting bitter political rivals in the state legislature â€“ to enforce social distancing and secure medical supplies. Still, Louisiana is one of the worst-hit states, and the coronavirus crisis has highlighted the stark health disparities there. At the other end of this crisis, Edwards will have to brace for blame and well as credit from voters. The signature aspect of Bakerâ€™s time as governor has been how he has distanced himself from the president without sparking the ire of his party. Baker, a moderate Republican, has at times loudly disagreed with Trump â€“ bluntly shooting down the presidentâ€™s suggestion to reopen the country for business by Easter. He has also communicated effectively with his constituents, providing even-keeled updates, while also showing emotion and empathy. Baker has also launched a statewide relief fund for households and workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic. His pragmatism and persistence in response to the crisis have won him bipartisan praise, and reinforced his image as a moderate foil to Trump. Parson finally issued a shelter-in-place order for Missouri on 6 April, after resisting the move for weeks. Even then, the Republican left loopholes that allow even non-essential businesses to remain open, and undermined his own policy, calling it a â€œpiece of paperâ€. His obstinacy, even as medical experts and local leaders within his state pleaded with him to take action as the number of cases rose, triggered the non-partisan Cook Political Report to downgrade his chances of winning re-election in the gubernatorial election in November. Republican DeSantis has received a wave of criticism for his response to the coronavirus in Florida. His shelter-in-place order contains notable exceptions â€“ it doesnâ€™t bar churches from holding services, in a state where megachurches have held packed, risky services for hundreds of parishioners. DeSantis has defended himself by insisting that public health decisions should be left to local officials. Still, he has stayed in Trumpâ€™s good graces. The president called him â€œa great governor who knows exactly what heâ€™s doingâ€. #PresidentNewsom was trending on Twitter after Newsom appeared on Rachel Maddowâ€™s TV show, and announced a deal to secure 200m medical-grade masks per month for California. Newsom enacted one of the earliest and strictest orders to stay at home on 19 March, and the tactic seems to have paid off: California appears to be â€œflattening the curveâ€. Democrat Newsom and Trump have publicly feuded throughout the first-term governorâ€™s time in office but during the pandemic he has repeatedly won praise from the president. Even before the pandemic the first-term governor of Michigan was emerging as a rising Democratic star mentioned as a possible running mate for Joe Biden. Since the pandemic Whitmer has issued a wave of executive orders and declared an early state of emergency on 10 March. Sheâ€™s become a regular presence on news networks (though that has sparked local criticism). She has called out the Trump administrationâ€™s coordination with governors during the pandemic, which has led to public tussles with the president. Arguably the Republican who has earned the most praise for his swift response to the pandemic, DeWine decided to close Ohioâ€™s bars, schools and restaurants early and also moved to postpone the stateâ€™s primary election. In March DeWine ordered schools and non-essential businesses to close. DeWine, a mild-mannered career bureaucrat, is not known as a bomb thrower or household name even in political circles. Republicans and Democratic officials have expressed support for DeWineâ€™s early moves to slow the pandemic. He may be the only governor who has become a popular meme during the pandemic. No other governor has received as much attention as Cuomo during the pandemic. Thatâ€™s partially because New York has been one of the states hardest hit by the pandemic. But Cuomo, a Democrat known less for his charisma and more for his combative technocratic governing style, has used his daily briefings to strike an above-politics imageduring the pandemic. But his handling of the crisis has fallen under intense scrutiny and Cuomo has found himself on the receiving end of both rare praise from Trump and lashing criticism. Hogan, one of the most popular governors in the country, has at times taken a low profile, and at other times embraced the spotlight. He weighed challenging Trump in the 2020 Republican primary before opting against it. A second-term Republican governor who serves as the chairman of the National Governors Association, Hogan has had to act as something of the voice for all 50 governors throughout the pandemic. Hogan has also been that rare breed of Republican who has contested some of Trumpâ€™s statements publicly. Governors elsewhere have been trading notes with Hogan. He has also leaned on health experts in his state to navigate the crisis. In the lead-up to the Wisconsin primary, Evers, a first-term Democrat who ousted Scott Walker, found himself wrestling with the Republican-controlled state legislature over whether to allow in-person voting despite a stay-at-home order. Other states, meanwhile, postponed their primaries. At times, Evers was criticized by other Democrats for his approach to delaying the election. Just before the primary, he issued an executive order postponing in-person voting. But that was overturned by the stateâ€™s supreme court, meaning voters would gather in large groups to vote against the warnings of health experts. However, Democrats came out of the election with a victory in the stateâ€™s supreme court election where the liberal candidate beat a conservative incumbent endorsed by Trump.",0,
313,How Bernie Sanders could actually be helping the stock market et  - CNN,"Matt Egan, CNN Business","New York (CNN Business) Few could have predicted this scenario: The American stock market is brushing up against record highs at the same time that Bernie Sanders is the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Despite the Sanders surge, or perhaps because of it, the Dow has flirted with the 30,000 level for the first time ever. The Nasdaq , even after taking into account Thursday's sudden retreat, is sporting an impressive 8% gain this year. And momentum stocks like Virgin Galactic ( SPCE ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) have gone bonkers. If Bernie begins to pull away, that's positive for Trump -- and by extension, positive for stocks."" David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers There are a few schools of thought for why investors are not freaking out about the rise of Sanders. Or at least not yet. Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist who has proudly promised to be a ""nightmare"" for Wall Street, insurance companies and the fossil fuels industry. One obvious reason for the muted market reaction: It's just way too early for markets to brace for the potential policies of a Sanders White House. Wall Street is betting that eventually a moderate such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg will win the nomination, perhaps after a contentious convention. For now, investors are focused on the resilience of the American economy, an ocean of easy money from global central banks and hopes that the coronavirus storm will soon pass. Read More Others may be dismissing the threat from Sanders because even if elected, he'd have a very difficult time getting bold policies such as a wealth tax and a fracking ban through Congress. That's especially true if Republicans maintain control of the Senate. Yet the most intriguing explanation is that the success of Sanders is actually bullish for stocks. That's because investors view Sanders as an easy foil for President Donald Trump. And a Trump reelection would signal a continuation of the low taxes and light regulation that investors love, not to mention an obsessive-focus on the stock market. ""You have to conclude that the markets are expecting Sanders to lose, perhaps decisively,"" said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investment. Trump has gone from underdog to favorite Traders on prediction market PredictIt seem to agree with that sentiment. Trump was a slight underdog 90 days ago , with a 42% chance to win reelection. Now, he's the favorite on PredictIt, with a 55% chance of winning in November. That swing has coincided with the rise of Sanders. ""The market perception is that Bernie Sanders will be an easier candidate for President Trump to beat,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory. Michael Bloomberg might not be Wall Street's BFF after all By that logic, more strength from Sanders could actually lift stocks further. ""If Bernie begins to pull away, that's positive for Trump -- and by extension, positive for stocks,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. Some investors may even be betting that a Sanders nomination could tip the scales in Congressional races, allowing Republicans to retake the US House of Representatives. ""If it's Bernie Sanders, could Republicans run the table?"" said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. ""That's where there could be another round of tax cuts."" Stocks have zoomed under Trump Many believe the most market-friendly outcome to the election would be four more years of Trump. Wall Street loves the pro-business planks of Trump's economic agenda: low taxes, deregulation and surging government spending. And markets are relieved that the US-China trade war has cooled off. ""There's only one candidate Wall Street will be happy with -- Trump,"" Valliere wrote in a recent note to clients. The S&P 500 has climbed nearly 50% since Trump took office in January 2017. The Dow's annualized gain of 13% under Trump is third among all presidents since 1900, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Of course, there is no guarantee that success would continue in a second Trump term. The ""pro-business"" parts of the Trump agenda are ""overshadowed by social negative"" such as wealth inequality that the market ""whistles past,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corporation. And then there's the threat of continued, if not additional, volatility in Washington. ""What happens if Trump is unbound by the need to win reelection?"" said Mills, the Raymond James analyst. ""He's been pretty bombastic in his first term. What does a second term of Trump look like?"" What if Wall Street is underestimating Bernie? But some market watchers are warning investors not to get overconfident in their political prognostications, especially with the election still nearly nine months away. Recall that in 2016 few thought it was possible Trump would win the nomination, let alone the presidency. And then he did. Likewise, investment banks warned Trump would be a disaster for stocks. And then he wasn't. Goldman Sachs warns of stock market correction ""We make this mistake every four years by saying this is definitely what is happening -- and then it doesn't,"" said Hogan. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's too early. The players are just warming up."" UBS warned in a report Thursday that while investors have a ""high level of confidence"" Trump will get reelected, national polls suggest a ""close"" contest between any Democratic candidate and the president. ""We could just be setting ourselves up for a bigger reaction later on if the market is wrong,"" said Mills. The key will be how markets react if Sanders continues his momentum after the Super Tuesday on March 3 when delegate-heavy states such as California, Texas and Virginia vote. ""I would expect some market jitters if Bernie Sanders continues to accumulate delegates and has any kind of high-profile primary wins,"" Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, told CNN's Julia Chatterley on Wednesday. ""It could create a selloff in the S&P 500."" In other words, the Sanders freakout on Wall Street might not have been canceled. It's just been delayed.",0,
123,Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus,Andrew W. Saul,"The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C.

Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.

It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.

But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.

“I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” (Robert F. Cathcart, MD)

The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:

Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams (or more) daily, in divided doses.

Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000)

Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form)

Zinc: 20 mg daily

Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily

Vitamin C [1], Vitamin D [2], magnesium [3], zinc [4], and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.

The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s.[6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980.[7]

It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?",1,
19,"PROOF: The ""Novel Coronavirus"" Infecting the World is a MILITARY BIO-WEAPON Developed by China's Army",Anonymous,"The ""novel Coronavirus"" outbreak affecting China and many other countries right now, has been determined to be a military BIO-WEAPON, which was being worked on at the Wuhan Virology Laboratory by China's People's Liberation Army, Anonymousjiang Command.  Somehow, it got out.  The world is now facing a massive wipe-out of humanity as a result. The proof that this virus is a genetically-modified Bat-SARS-Like Virus, manipulated by the Chinese Army, appears below.  The evidence is irrefutable. Two separate components of genetic sequencing from HIV-1,  the virus which causes AIDS, were added to Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus in the laboratory, thereby allowing it to infect human lungs via the ACES2 receptors in our lungs, and to disrupt the human body ability to fight it off, by reducing human leukocytes. BIO-WEAPON PROOF Make no mistake: this disease is, in fact, a MILITARY biological weapon.   The disease sequence from the original Bat coronavirus was uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine, in the year 2018 by China's Institute of Military Medicine, Anonymousjing Command.  The image below from the National Center for Biotechnology Information proves the upload (Click image to enlarge): That Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus was issued Reference ID: AVP 70833.1 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the U.S. Library of Medicine. The present outbreak of ""novel Coronavirus"" was uploaded to that same National Center for Biotechnology Information in January of this year by the Shanghai Public Heath Clinical Center and was issued Reference ID: QHD3418.1.  Here is proof of THAT upload (Click image to enlarge): Using the test facilities known as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) from the U.S. National Library of Medicine researchers have determined that the ""virus envelope"" of those two separate diseases, are 100% identical!   Here is the BLAST Test result (Click image to enlarge): MORE:  a new study shows that elements of HIV have been found in the new ""novel coronavirus!""   From that study: We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV). The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature. There is no way in nature that the Bat coronavirus could fortuitously acquire the HIV genetic sequences, without causing a mutation of the Virus Envelope.   The ONLY way the virus envelope could obtain the HIV genetics and still remain 100% identical to the 2018 sample, is if the HIV genes were added in a laboratory. So what the human race is now facing, is an accidentally-released military bio-weapon.  The original Bat-SARS-Like Coronavirus was identified by China's People's Liberation Army, through the Institute of Military Medicine, Anonymousjiang Command in the year 2018.  They uploaded the virus sequence and they were the sole entity in possession of the virus. Here we are, two years later, and the virus they had has been changed in a way that cannot occur in nature without mutating the virus envelope protein. This isn't rocket science; this is as plain as day.  China conducted genetic manipulation of their Bat-SARS-like virus and created a new virus capable of infecting humans.  That new virus was apparently accidentally-released and is the ""novel coronavirus"" the world is now battling. I am sorry to have to report, many of us are very likely to LOSE this battle.  Just like many are already losing their battle inside China and elsewhere. QUARANTINE Within the first month of this outbreak in China, the government there effectively QUARANTINED more than fifty-six MILLION people (56,000,000) in nineteen (19) major cities, even though China reported publicly that only a few hundred were infected and only about 25 had died by that time. WHY? Why would China lockdown 19 cities and effectively Quarantine 56 Million people for such a trivial disease?   Because China KNEW it wasn't trivial.  China KNEW it was a military bio-weapon which had accidentally gotten out.  And China also KNEW how far this would spread and how fast.  China is guilty as sin. DISEASE FACTS: Here are the now-established FACTS about this disease: This disease has an eighty-three percent (83%) infection rate.  That means if 100 people are EXPOSED to this virus, 83 WILL get sick from it. The Disease can spread by AIR.  It is HIGHLY, HIGHLY contagious. When a person breathes, virus comes out with those breaths.  Same thing when a person sneezes or coughs. Same when urinating or having a bowel movement.  ALL OF IT HAS VIRUS IN IT.
The virus can live OUTSIDE a person, in the air or on a surface, for a minimum of five days, and a maximum of twenty eight days. So if an infected person goes into a store or supermarket, or public bathroom, or a school, office, warehouse . . . . or anywhere . . . . touches products on shelves and puts anything back, or sneezes or coughs, his virus gets on the products in that store or supermarket, bathroom, school, office, warehouse, etc., and can survive. YOU walk-in a couple minutes, hours or even DAYS later, and pick up the same item, or even smell their stink in the bathroom - POW, you're infected. WORSE: This virus can infect others through the eyes and ears. Let's say you're walking inside somewhere and an infected person was there minutes earlier and coughed or sneezed.   The cough or sneeze threw microscopic droplets into the air, which float for awhile.  A few minutes later, you walk through that air.  One or more of the microscopic droplets gets on your eye.  You don't even KNOW it because the things are so small. You blink.  We all blink. Your eye lid pushes the virus off the surface of your eye, down into the bottom eye area, and the virus washes down into your tear duct.  POW- you're infected. It cannot be overstated that this virus is the worst public disease crisis the world has faced in over 100 years.  Not since the Spanish Flu of 1918 has the world faced such death and this is already heading toward being far WORSE than the Spanish Flu. The Spanish Flu spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States. When a disease outbreak occurs, one of the measurements that scientists use to see how badly the disease will spread is known as R0. The 1918-1919 pandemic-causing Spanish flu is estimated to have had an R0 ranging from 1.4 – 2.8, with a mean of 2.  This means that for every person infected, that person could be expected to infect another 1.4 to 2.8 additional people. I regret to report that the R0 of this Bio-Weapon is already showing itself to be R4.08   . . .  FAAAAAAR Worse than the 1918 Spanish Flu. Here's where things get very bad, very fast. According to Satistia, the number of all hospital beds in the U.S. 1975-2017, is decreasing. In 1975, there were about 1.5 million hospital beds in the U.S., but until 2017 the number dropped to just about 931 thousand. According to TrendingEconomics, Hospital beds (per 1,000 people) in United States was reported at 2.9 in 2013, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public, private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation centers. Using the Infection Rate of 83% listed above, out of 1,000 people exposed to this Bio-Weapon, 830 will become infected. There are 2.9 Hospital beds per thousand US citizens.  So when 830 people get infected, how many can those 2.9 hospital beds hold???????   Yea.  2.9. What happens to the rest?   They cannot get hospital care. Right now, when a person cannot get hospital care for this disease, the death rate for such people is 65-70%. That means me and you.  Dead.

482,Japanese medical workers fear the worst as coronavirus cases spike - CNN,"Emiko Jozuka, CNN","Tokyo (CNN) Ayako Kajiwara is scared Japan's medical system isn't prepared for what might happen next. She's the lead nurse at a hospital in Saitama prefecture and is witnessing firsthand the strain on an intensive care unit that's treating critically ill coronavirus patients. ""It's hard because we think the patient is improving, but then they'll suddenly take a turn for the worse,"" she said. In the past few weeks, Japan's coronavirus cases have spiked -- dashing hopes that the government's initial virus response had succeeded in controlling its spread. As of Friday, Japan had 9,787 confirmed cases, including 190 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. On March 1, the country had 243 cases. JUST WATCHED Inside the ER: The incredible fight against coronavirus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Inside the ER: The incredible fight against coronavirus 05:30 The sharp increase has prompted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to extend the state of emergency from seven prefectures to the entire country. On Friday, he also promised to provide medical equipment such as surgical masks, gowns and face shields to hospitals struggling with acute gear shortages within a week. Read More Earlier this week, a team of government experts warned that Japan could have more than 400,000 coronavirus-related deaths if measures such as social distancing are not taken. But most deaths, they warned, could result from a lack of ventilators. The shortage of medical supplies became clear this week when Osaka mayor Ichiro Matsui urged people to donate unused raincoats for health workers to use as personal protective equipment, after they'd been forced to wear trash bags. Experts say medical shortages combined with comparatively low testing rates and Japan's lack of provision for teleworking threatens to create a potentially explosive uptick in cases. Hospital clusters As Japan battled the virus, infection clusters are forming in hospitals, too. On April 12, 87 new coronavirus cases were confirmed among doctors, nurses and inpatients at a hospital in Tokyo's Nakano ward, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. The increase of clusters in hospitals is particularly concerning, owing to the potential for further community transmission. ""It's very important to move testing away from clinics and hospitals,"" said Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London and a former chief of health policy at the World Health Organization (WHO). ""The lack of testing in Japan led to widespread community infection. Hospital workers are not prepared as they don't know the infection status of the patient."" Medical staffs wearing protective gears hold an exercise for coronavirus outbreak at a hospital on February 7, 2020 in Tottori, Japan. In Yokohama, paramedic Sho Hayakawa has seen a steady increase in coronavirus patients at his hospital in recent weeks. As a father, he worries about bringing the virus home to his wife and toddler. ""I do worry about contracting it, but I'm being extra careful,"" he said. Tokyo and Osaka have started transferring patients with mild coronavirus symptoms to hotels to alleviate the strain on hospitals, with other prefectures expected to follow suit soon. Hayakawa hopes similar measures will be implemented in Yokohama. Anesthesiologist Mio Shin said that after her colleague had to self-quarantine because he worked with a doctor from another hospital who was suspected of having coronavirus, she took on his workload. ""Many doctors take shifts at different hospitals, so I felt like overstretched clinics across Japan were temporarily losing staff members as they unwittingly came into contact with people who didn't know they had coronavirus,"" Shin said. She said that as more medical workers are needed to care for coronavirus patients, there will be fewer people to take on everything from cancer and infertility treatment to heart surgery and maternity care. ""I think people in Japan may not have realized how these absences will affect not only coronavirus treatments, but also everything from infertility and cancer treatments, as other medical workers are needed to care for coronavirus patients,"" Shin said. Cluster approach under scrutiny Since Japan recorded its first coronavirus cases in February, officials have focused on containing infection clusters rather than the widespread testing seen in countries such as neighboring South Korea. Japan has only tested about 90,000 people, compared with more than 513,000 in South Korea, which has a population of 51 million, compared to Japan's 126 million. Experts suspect the infection rate could already be much higher than official statistics reveal. Japan's testing approach is geared towards pinpointing patients in need of urgent medical attention to avoid overwhelming hospitals. The country has the capacity to conduct up to 12,000 tests per day, but in reality does between 6,000 and 7,000, according to a spokesman from the ministry of health. On Wednesday, the Tokyo metropolitan medical association announced it would establish up to 20 new testing locations. Eiji Kusumi, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases, said he had already signed up to administer them. ""Once testing becomes available for people with more mild symptoms, we will likely see more coronavirus cases,"" he said. JUST WATCHED Japan's Shinzo Abe promotes anti-flu drug to treat virus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan's Shinzo Abe promotes anti-flu drug to treat virus 02:39 The government has repeatedly stressed confidence in its testing strategy. ""We are continuing to focus on the cluster approach as we are not seeing an overshoot in coronavirus cases yet,"" a health ministry spokesman said. However, in some cases Japan hasn't been able to trace the cause of infection. When Tokyo recorded 197 new coronavirus cases last Saturday in its second highest single-day jump, for example, officials were unable to track down the source for 77% of the cases, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. ""In big cities it's very difficult to contain and keep track of (infection) clusters as there will be various routes of transmission,"" said Shibuya, the former WHO official. To contain clusters, health workers must interview people who have tested positive to deduce how they became infected. However, given coronavirus can survive on surfaces like doorknobs and light switches, it is often difficult to determine how people contracted the virus, Shibuya said. The focus on containing clusters worked in the early stages when the infection rate was still low and localized, but as healthcare systems are under increasing pressure, there is an urgent need to reassess this strategy, he added. Need to shift public messaging Takayuki Miyazawa, a virologist at Kyoto University, said that to contain the virus, the government needs to be honest with people about what life with the virus will look like for the forseeable future: specifically, a lot of social distancing and remote working. ""Politicians are giving people too much hope and telling them to endure the state of emergency just until May 6 when it is expected to lift,"" said Miyazawa. ""So people think all this will be over by May 6, but they haven't understood the reality -- that we have to keep having to keep up our guard up against the virus."" Lead nurse Kajiwara said her hospital established an intensive care unit dedicated to coronavirus patients in early April, but with only six beds -- half of which are occupied -- Kajiwara fears they'll soon be overwhelmed. JUST WATCHED Japan moves to announce state of emergency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan moves to announce state of emergency 02:45 Nationwide, Japan only has seven ICU beds per 100,000 citizens, compared to 35 per 100,000 citizens in the US, according to the Japanese Society of Intensive Care. There is also a concern around equipment shortages. According to information provided by the country's Society of Respiratory Medicine, there are only 22,000 ventilators for a population of over 126 million. In late February, 40% were in use. Kajiwara said her team was doing everything possible to care for patients, knowing that some won't make it and that they themselves also run the risk of infection. ""I want to hold onto hope,"" she said. ""The whole experience made me think that we lived so comfortably in Japan and took many things for granted. I think people are realizing what they need and what's really important to them now.""",0,
144,Who Treats Russophobia as the Best Cure for COVID-19?,Vladimir Odintsov,"he current political elites in the United States and the European Union are attempting to distract the public from their helplessness and failed attempts to stem the spread of the Coronavirus (as, unfortunately, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is at present higher in the USA and the EU than in Asia!) by blaming Vladimir Putin’s trolls for their own incompetence and by spreading anti-Russia propaganda via media outlets under their control.

In the middle of March, the European Commission published a report prepared by the East StratCom Task Force, a part of the administration of the European External Action Service (EEAS), saying that Russian media had deployed a “significant disinformation campaign against the West to worsen the impact of the Coronavirus, generate panic and sow distrust”.

So what does Russia’s “disinformation campaign” really entail? The fact is that the EU failed to act and help Italy in its battle against the Coronavirus. Russia, on the other hand, did come to the aid of this member state of the EU, which had been created under the banner of “collaboration and close cooperation” but chose not to join efforts to fight the pandemic. It is noteworthy that the Italian government also asked the US armed forces for help, after all, there are American military bases in Italy. But neither Brussels nor Washington came to its aid, and instead Moscow chose to lend a helping hand.

However, disseminators of anti-Russia propaganda within the EU continued with their Russophobic campaign and began publishing reports about Russia’s “ulterior motives” in media outlets subservient to them.

Out of all the news sources in Italy, newspaper La Stampa was the most zealous in its efforts. It compared the Russian convoy with aid to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan and said, on behalf of all Russophobes, that “80% of the equipment” provided was of little or no use. In fact, the Russian Federation, at the request of the Italian government, had sent 15 transport aircraft with medicine, medical equipment and doctors to Italy. This aid helped Lombardy stem the uncontrollable spread of the Coronavirus in the region.

It is thus not surprising that, on 26 March, President of the Lombardy Regional government Attilio Fontana said there was “always someone, jackals” who speculated on these topics. Prime Minister of Italy Giuseppe Conte said that the mere insinuation that Moscow had tried to capitalize on the initiative for its public relations was offensive. Maurizio Marrone, the head of the Brothers of Italy parliamentary faction and member of the council, told TASS that the Regional Council of Piedmont (a region in Northern Italy) had sent an official request for help in their battle against the Coronavirus to Russia.

No one is denying the importance of freedom of speech or the press, but the right of media outlets to publish reports of their own choosing cannot be used as an excuse to criticize humanitarian aid provided to those suffering or countries responsible for such efforts. Such behavior is predatory, especially so when such libel is published at the behest of Russophobes from “across the pond” who pay for such reports. In addition, individuals with anti-Russia views who have already “proven their worth” are being used in the current information war. That admissions made to Ukrainian internet publication Obozrevatel lend further evidence to the fact that Ukrainian Russophobes in Italy, among others, are behind La Stampa’s disinformation campaign.

The Russian Federation is not the only nation to fall victim to this information war. “While patients, politicians and health experts all over the world appreciate” the commitment shown by 52 Cuban doctors and nurses in Italy during the fight against the consequences of the Coronavirus pandemic, some German media outlets have begun their hate campaign against the volunteers from the socialist island republic. German newspaper Junge Welt has written about this and has pointed out that the Stuttgarter Zeitung and the Mannheimer Morgen had been particularly helpful in the ongoing information war.  The article also reproachfully reminded us that only a few weeks ago, “passengers on the Norwegian-British cruise ship MS Braemar,” which had been allowed to dock in Cuba, expressed their gratitude on social networking websites to the Cuban government that came to their aid after a number of nations had denied entry to the vessel. Having endured quite an ordeal on the ship for a number of days, the passengers disembarked in the Cuban port of Mariel where they then received necessary medical help.

Of course, American experts on the “Russian threat” also did not miss out on their chance to become involved in the information war being waged. They responded to the medical cargo sent by the Russian Federation to the United States in a predictable manner. Although US President Donald Trump called the aid to be provided by Russia to the USA in its fight against the Coronavirus “very nice”, a number of American media outlets saw something sinister in Moscow’s actions. The Washington Post reported some experts on Russia were surprised by the fact that a country, which the United States had imposed sanctions against for interfering in 2016 US Presidential elections and for annexing Crimea in 2014, decided to send its Antonov An-124 (a large civil cargo aircraft) with medical aid to a nation that had referred to the Russian Federation under its current leadership as a “strategic opponent” from a national security perspective. Andrew S. Weiss, an expert who oversees research on Russia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, commented on the help from Moscow in his Twitter feed by saying: “This is nuts!”. Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars’ KenAnonymous Institute who studies Russian disinformation, tweeted that Russia’s actions were “mind boggling”.

Once the news that Moscow would be sending medical equipment to the United States broke, an active discussion among readers on Fox News’s website began. And a few individuals expressed their gratitude for the help to be provided by the Russian Federation.

Ilta-Sanomat, Finland’s evening newspaper, reported that the world had turned upside down since Russia was to help the suffering United States as the Coronavirus pandemic raged on. The article also added that it was only after foreign powers had begun to provide aid that the European Union realized that its member states also needed to help each other.

In light of the disinformation campaign that was sparked in response to humanitarian and selfless steps taken by Russia to help in the battle against the Coronavirus pandemic, the author would like to say that freedom of speech and the press, one of the greatest achievements of modern civilization, really ought to encourage individuals to report truthfully and responsibly.",1,
176,FORMER PUTIN’S AIDE: CORONAVIRUS IS THE US BIOLOGICAL WEAPON,Anonymous,"An economist, academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences Sergey Glazyev is sure that the novel coronavirus is man-made. He declared that on the air of the Russia “Tsargrad” TV channel.

“The picture is painfully familiar,” he describes the situation, adding that in many ways it is similar to 2014.

“The same beneficiaries: fiAnonymouscial speculators. The same conductors are from across the ocean, ”- said the expert on the program.- “Americans…have a full arsenal of biological weapons. And this manifestation of the US hybrid warfare against the economic sectors they do not control is perfectly understandable and logical. ”

Of course, the coronavirus was also detected in the United States itself, but one can recall that the British, who provoked Hitler at the beginning of World War II, became mass victims of the bombing of German aircraft, the expert emphasized.

The elite is in principle insured against this. At the same time, the American ruling elite is also armed not only with information technology, but also with a biological weapon, which continues to develop contrary to all international obligations. In addition, the American elite has a huge arsenal for manipulating international fiAnonymouscial markets. “Primitive Malthusian ideas still prevail there, one can constantly hear that there are too many humanity, that the planet, they say, cannot survive so many people, and so on. Therefore, they die today, you look, mostly people of the yellow race, so to speak. This is China, Korea, Japan. Among Europeans, such a tragic fate befell people with reduced immunity, the elderly, who are traditionally regarded as ballast for this ideology of the ""golden billion"",- Sergey Glazyev stated.",1,
416,China 'bars lawyer from going home' after prison release | World news | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu,"A prominent Chinese human rights lawyer barred from returning home after his prison release two weeks ago has been prohibited from reuniting with his family after a 14-day quarantine period Wang Quanzhangâ€™s wife and rights groups fear authorities are using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to hold him indefinitely under de facto house arrest. Wang, a lawyer who lives in Beijing, had taken on politically sensitive cases and defended activists and members of the banned religious group Falun Gong. He was taken to his hometown of Jinan, 400km (250 miles) south of Beijing, for a compulsory quarantine on 4 April. But even though authorities told him he would be freed after 14 days, he has been barred from returning to Beijing, his wife Li Wenzu said on Sunday. â€œToday is the 15th day and he still canâ€™t return to Beijing,â€ she told the Guardian. â€œI really cannot accept this.â€ Li said during the past two weeks, Wang was only able to hold phone conversations with her under the supervision of police, who controlled the content and length of his communications. In their conversations over the past two weeks, she said Wang had said her online postings â€œwere causing him troubleâ€ and ordered her to delete them. She said Wang called her on Saturday, saying he was unable to go home because he had â€œjust come out and needed to get used to (everything)â€. She questioned whether he was speaking of his own accord. â€œThis is not the Wang Quanzhang I knew,â€ she said. â€œThe pain is like a knife stabbing into my bleeding heart.â€ Wang was detained in August 2015. After being held incommunicado for three and a half years he was sentenced in January 2019 on the blanket charge of â€œsubversion of state powerâ€. He was one of more than 300 lawyers and activists detained in crackdowns that started in July 2015. He was the last lawyer of the group to be convicted. Francine Chan, the executive director of Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, said: â€œThe harassment, surveillance and effective house arrest of Wang Quanzhang after his â€˜releaseâ€™ vividly illustrate Chinaâ€™s use of the pandemic to extend Wangâ€™s imprisonment in violation of Chinese and international law.â€ Chinese rights activists are often released from prison into de facto house arrest or enforced restriction to their native village, where they remain for years. This is a practice dubbed â€œnon-release releaseâ€ by rights groups. Another lawyer, , who was released on 28 February 2019, is still under house arrest in his hometown in rural Henan and has been denied proper medical care. Human Rights Watchâ€™s China researcher, Yaqiu Wang, called Wang Quanzhangâ€™s continued detention is â€œa complete travesty of justiceâ€ and that the Chinese government seemed determined to silence Wang indefinitely. William Nee, a China researcher at Amnesty International said Wangâ€™s case shows the suppression of the lawyer community â€œcombined with the Communist partyâ€™s systematic use of incommunicado detention, torture and ill-treatment, harassment of family members, show trials and post-release surveillance has given the international community a clear warning of what to expect under Chinaâ€™s understanding of â€˜rule by lawâ€™â€.

107,Cuomo considers banning cigarette sales for six weeks amid Coronavirus outbreak,Anonymous,"Governor Andrew Cuomo is considering a temporary six-week ban on the sale of combustible cigarettes in order to reduce the State’s Coronavirus death count, a source familiar with his thinking tells The Chronicle.  The ban could come as soon as Monday and is expected to be included in a budget measure already scheduled to be announced.
New data out of Italy suggest that the nation’s whopping Coronavirus death rate — now approaching 10% of those who test positive — is highly correlated to cigarette use.  Italian men smoke cigarettes at rates that far outpace most other developed countries, and the extreme shortage of ventilators there has been the cause of death for tens of thousands of smokers.
According to Italy’s National Health Institute, smokers with COVID-19 were one-third more likely to have a serious clinical situation than non-smokers. Half of these smokers required a ventilator.
For many weeks, it was observed that women in Italy are better able to overcome the virus than men.  Italian doctors now believe that the statistical difference is attributable to smoking-related gender norms.
COVID-19 kills its victims by compromising the respiratory system and reducing oxygen levels in the blood.  Regular cigarette use damages the airways and small air sacs in the lungs.  Combustible cigarettes weaken smokers’ lungs by filling them with smoke and tar.
“When a smoker contracts COVID-19, he or she will be far more likely to suffer respiratory system failure, thereby exacerbating New York’s ventilator shortage,” Cuomo plans to say in remarks prepared for Monday.   “Fortunately, medical science informs us that ex-smokers experience significant recovery in lung function and oxygen absorption as soon as they quit smoking.”
Former smokers recover 30% of their lung function just two weeks after quitting.
“Any ex-smoker can tell you how, just days after quitting, they were noticeably less out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs. Personally, I have heard hundreds of these stories,” he writes in draft remarks.
Dr. Howard Zucker, the Commissioner of Health, is prodding Cuomo to issue the temporary ban and discussed the issue with him privately earlier this week.  Zucker has long advocated for additional restrictions on combustible cigarette sales, which causes more than 443,000 deaths annually — more deaths each year than from murder, car accidents, alcohol or drug use, suicides, and HIV combined.
It’s estimated that 81,000 people will die from COVID-19.
Zucker argues that a ban on cigarette sales for the duration of the outbreak will save thousands of lives and will reduce the State’s shortage of ventilators, perhaps by several thousand during its peak — expected to hit the State 21 days from today.
Therefore, the Governor’s advisors postulate, if New York takes immediate action and temporarily bans combustible cigarette sales during this public health crisis, ex-smokers’ respiratory systems will make significant recovery at the very same time that COVID-19 cases are peaking in New York.
“This will save lives, and not just the lives of smokers,” the Governor plans to say.  “Every former smoker that gets sick, but does not need a ventilator, means one more ventilator is available to keep our aging parents and grandparents alive.”
“Importantly, we must also recognize that failing to temporarily ban combustible cigarettes immediately will cause a disproportionate increase in COVID-19 fatalities in minority communities, given the higher prevalence of immuno-deficiencies in these communities,” he plans to note.
The Governor’s supporters argue that it is more important now than ever to address the public health cost of combustible cigarettes — not just to save the lives of smokers, but to save the lives of all New Yorkers by mitigating the severity of a ventilator shortage.",1,

56,China – Western China Bashing – vs. Western Bio-warfare?,Peter Koenig,"On 29 January WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that there was no reason to declare the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV in China a pandemic risk. On 30 January, he declared the virus an international emergency, but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel-advisories against travelling to China. Let me speculate – the ‘international emergency’ was declared at the request of Washington, and the comment against the travel-advisory was an addition by Dr. Tedros himself, as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic, that China is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on.

In fact, Dr. Tedros has himself, as well as other high-ranking WHO officials, on various occasions praised China for her effort to contain the virus, the speed with which Wuhan (population of 11 million, capital of the center-eastern Province of Hubei) and China as a whole has reacted to the outbreak. The latest achievement – in 8 days China has built in Wuhan a 25,000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV and possible mutations, with 1,000 beds, and for about 1,400 medical personnel, for a budget of the equivalent of US$ 43 million – equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology. No other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement.

Nevertheless, and against WHO’s guidance, Washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to China, and withdrew non-essential staff from US consulates and the Embassy in Beijing, thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among Washington vassals around the globe – i.e. most of the European countries did likewise, many of them canceled their flights to China, as did of course the US. For some reasons I have yet to understand, Russia closed her 4,200 km long border with China. Would Russia fall to the western panic-mongering propaganda hype? – Hard to believe. But then what is the reason?

The NYT and WashPo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify China with lies and manipulated information on how badly China is managing the disease, when the complete opposite is the case. Compare this to the common flu epidemic, that hits the US and most of the western countries, despite the fact that the US and Europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination (in some US States and EU countries even compulsory).

Yet, this 2019 / 2020 flu season which is far from over, has so far claimed more than 8,400 lives alone in the US, more than 140,000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people. The US has about 330 million people. Compare this to China’s 1.4 billion population – with, as of 3 February, an infection rate of less than 21,000, a death toll of 425 in China, and outside of China reported two, one in Hong Kong, another one in the Philippines.

Expand these statistics to Europe and you find similar figures. Of course, nobody talks about it. This is an annual occurrence – a boAnonymousza for the western pharma industry. In the west, disease is business. The more the merrier. Once you are in the “medical mill”, it’s difficult to escape. “Specialists’ find always another reason to send you yet to another “specialist” – for another treatment. The ignorant patient has no option than to obey – after all its his health and life. In China it is the total opposite. The Chinese system does everything for its population’s health and well-being.

Yet, China bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day. Yesterday, 3 February, the UN in Geneva has issued an edict that all UN employees returning from China must stay home and work from home for 14 days, i.e. a dictated self-quarantine. And new contracts for Chinese staff will be temporarily suspended. This is all propaganda against China.

Quarantine is absolutely not necessary. Chinese biologists of the Office of Science and Technology of the city of Wuxi (south-eastern Jiangsu province, near Shanghai) have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019-nCoV virus within 8 – 15 minutes, similar to a pregAnonymouscy test. This test kit is available to the world. In fact, it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from New York at the Zurich airport and feeling ill. Within less than an hour, the crew member was sent home – it was the common flu.

In China, where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease – like all the coronaviral diseases, including the 2019-nCoV predecessor SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2002 / 2003 also in China), and its Middle East equivalent, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are not only laboratory fabricated, but also patented. And so are many others, for example, Ebola and HIV. Both, SARS and 2019-nCoV are not only man-made, but they are also focusing on the Chinese race. That’s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread.

It sounds like a strange coincidence that in October 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the John Hopkins Institute in the US, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WEF (World Economic Forum), as well as the Pirbright Institute of the UK, one of the world’s few level 4 (highest security level) bio-warfare laboratories.

The west’s ‘demolition’ priority seems to have shifted drastically from Russia to China. Why? – Because China is an ever-stronger economic power, soon to surpass the United States in absolute terms. Since mid-2017, China is already number one, measured by the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) indicator, indeed the most important one, because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money.

China’s currency, the Yuan, is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency, gradually replacing the US-dollar. When that happens, that real money, like the Chinese Yuan, based on a hard economy and covered by gold, against a “fake” fiat currency (based on nothing), like the US-dollar, is taking the lead, then the US-dollar hegemony is broken and the US economy doomed.

To prevent that from happening Washington is doing everything possible to destabilize China – see Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang Province, Tibet, the infamous Trump-inspired “tariff war” – and now the new coronavirus outbreak. The death toll is at present about 2.1% (of total cases of infection), down from 2.3% a week ago.

But that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda, travel bans, border closures, flight bans – and more – plus the disease itself, the medical care, work absenteeism, medication and medical equipment, not to forget the specially-built 1,000-bed emergency hospital in Wuhan – and an 8% average decline at the Shanghai stock exchange, bear a considerable economic cost for China. So much so, that the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has recently injected some 1.2 billion yuan (about US$ 174 million equivalent) into the economy.

This new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, may just be a trial. Imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the Chinese population, say with a mortality rate of 10% to 20% or higher – it could cause real havoc. However, a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable – i.e. towards the Chinese race – and may risk spreading to the Caucasian race as well – meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide.

Remember the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide – at that time about one-third of the planet’s population – and killed at least 50 million people (a death rate of 10%), including some 700,000 Americans.

While preparing for the worst, because Washington – with the help of its level 4 bio-war lab –  will not let go easily, China’s approach of endless inventive creation, avoiding conflicts, will outlive the aggressor.",1,
502,"White House advises public to avoid groups of more than 10, asks people to stay away from bars and restaurants  - CNNPolitics","Kevin Liptak, CNN","(CNN) The White House advised all Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 and urged older people to stay at home in a set of new guidelines designed to fight a spreading coronavirus outbreak. The new guidance, which President Donald Trump announced from the White House in an uncharacteristically sober press conference, reflected the heightened gravity of the situation facing the country as more and more people become infected. Trump himself appeared more downbeat about the short-term prospects for combating the virus, predicting the outbreak wouldn't be contained until at least the summer and suggesting a recession was possible. The recommendations he offered were the most substantive to date on how he would advise Americans carry out their lives as the virus spreads. Gone were predictions that it would soon fade or that it was under control, replaced instead by a much longer-term outlook that he acknowledged was still uncertain. ""We'll see what happens, but they think August, could be July, could be longer than that,"" Trump said of the time when life might return to normal in the United States, where some cities have ordered residents to remain at home and localized lockdowns are beginning to take effect. Read More ""I've asked that question many, many times,"" Trump said, signaling his own desire to see the crisis end. Still, he said testing problems that plagued the administration's early response were resolved and gave himself a perfect 10 out of 10 when asked how he would grade his response to the coronavirus pandemic. ""It seems to me that if we do a really good job, we'll not only hold the death down to a level that is much lower than the other way, had we not done a good job,"" Trump said during an afternoon coronavirus task force briefing. As Trump was briefing, the Dow posted its worst point drop in history . The President acknowledged the US economy could be headed toward a recession, though said his focus was on fighting the virus itself. The guidelines Trump issued came after lengthy and sometimes-contentious debate among his advisers over how stringently to recommend Americans remain in place and avoid large crowds. They will remain in place for 15 days, officials said. The White House had initially focused on international travel restrictions and ramping up testing capacity. But over the course of several meetings this weekend, government health officials made the case that the White House needed to play a role in encouraging more serious public health measures, an administration official told CNN. With increased testing across the country leading to a worrying spike in the number of coronavirus cases, an administration official said the scale of the problem became more apparent. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, were among the officials pressing for the White House to issue more strenuous guidelines to slow the spread of the virus, based on data from new tests and updated modeling. Included in the new guidance was a recommendation for all Americans to stay away from bars, restaurants and food courts and to avoid discretionary travel. The guidelines also suggest closing schools and canceling all social visits in homes. Places that have seen community spread were given the more severe recommendation to close places like restaurants and gyms. ""If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we're going to have a big celebration all together,"" Trump said at the White House. As the virus continues to spread into more American communities, discussions have accelerated inside the White House on ways to encourage or require people to remain in place while health officials work to contain the disease. Members of the White House's coronavirus task force have disagreed on whether further restrictions â€” like limits on domestic travel or even some type of national lockdown â€” are necessary at the federal level. Some officials have warned that further attempts to limit Americans from traveling domestically could have a dire effect on the economy. Those arguments have been countered by health officials who say drastic measures are needed to ""flatten the curve"" â€” or slow the speed of contamination. In meetings, Trump suggested that issuing edicts or even recommendations about staying at home might cause undue panic and cause further market anxiety. But as the case count increased and top health officials pointed to isolation efforts in other countries that seemed to ""flatten the curve,"" he became convinced that action was necessary. Officials also said that the health experts' arguments were bolstered by actions and urgings by several governors who began instituting dramatic restrictions on public life over the weekend and urged the federal government to take charge. Speaking on Monday, Fauci acknowledged the recommendations were ""based on some rather serious consideration back and forth."" ""Some may look at them and say they're going to be really inconvenient for people. Some will look and say, well, maybe we've gone a little bit too far? They were well thought out,"" he said. ""I'll say it over and over again -- when you're dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are."" Still, the guidelines issued on Monday were only recommendations and not mandates. Most are steps public health officials have been pushing since the start of the outbreak, including staying home from work when feeling sick and avoiding discretionary travel. On Sunday, Fauci helped lay the groundwork for the stepped up guidelines when he talked about the need for the federal government to do ""whatever it takes"" to slow the spread and urged Americans to make ""dramatic"" reductions in their social interactions. His comments caused some consternation inside the White House because some officials believed he was getting ahead of where discussions stood in the task force. But later in the day he maintained he meant what he said. Several cities, including Philadelphia and San Francisco, and entire states, including Maryland, have already issued the orders for bars and restaurants to close as soon as Monday evening. Trump said he wasn't currently considering the type of nationwide lockdown that have been enacted in some European countries. ""We may look at certain areas, certain hotspots, as they call them, we'll be looking at that, but at this moment no we're not,"" he said. The guidelines -- and specifically the recommendation that people don't gather in groups of more than 10 -- marks a notable escalation from the guidance put out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Sunday recommending that no gatherings with 50 people or more take place for the next eight weeks to slow the spread of the virus. Striking a far more somber tone than previous press conferences, Trump acknowledged that the coronavirus is not under control in the US or internationally just one day after saying the virus is ""something we have tremendous control of."" Asked by CNN to revisit that statement, Trump claimed he was ""not referring to it"" -- meaning the virus -- when he talked about the situation being under control. ""When I'm talking about control, I'm saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we're dealing with,"" Trump said, adding that the virus is ""not under control for any place in the world."" Trump said he's offered a grim assessment of the worsening novel coronavirus outbreak with his 13-year-old son. 'It's bad, it's bad,"" Trump said in describing his conversations about the crisis with his youngest son, Barron. ""But we're going to be hopefully, a best case, not a worst case, and that's what we're working for."" CNN's Matthew Hoye, Paul LeBlanc, Jason Hoffman and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",0,
400,Merkel nightmare as economist warns coronavirus will cost Germany BILLIONS | World | News | Express.co.uk,Ciaran McGrath," Clement Fuest, President of the world-renowned Munich based think tank the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, offered his gloomy prognosis the day after Mrs Merkel introduced tough new lockdown restrictions, including a ban on meetings of more than two people except for families. Out of more than 330,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, Germany currently has 24,774 according to the latest World Health Organization figures published today, a rise of 3,311 on the day before, with 94 deaths. In a report published on Monday, the Ifo said the pandemic would inflict hundreds of billions of euros' worth of damage in the form of lost productivity, resulting in skyrocketing unemployment, and imposing massive strains on the state budget. The costs are expected to exceed everything known in Germany from economic crises or natural disasters in recent decades Clement Fuest He said: ""The costs are expected to exceed everything known in Germany from economic crises or natural disasters in recent decades."" Mr Fuest added: â€œIt is therefore worthwhile to use almost every conceivable amount for health policy measures. ""The goal must be to shorten the partial closure of the economy without compromising the fight against the epidemic.   ""Strategies are needed that can link production resumption with further containment of the epidemic."" He explained: ""If the economy comes to a standstill for two months, costs can range from â‚¬255 to â‚¬495billion depending on the scenario. ""Economic output then shrinks by 7.2 to 11.2 percentage points in the year.â€  READ MORE: Panic as coronavirus erupts across Africa 'People will die on streets'  The best case scenario assumed economic output would decline to 59.6 percent for two months, recover to 79.8 percent in the third month and finally reach 100 percent in the fourth month, the report argues. Mr Fuest said: â€œWith three months of partial closure, the costs already reach â‚¬354 to â‚¬729billion, which is a 10.0 to 20.6 percentage point loss in growth."" Ifo calculations suggest a single week's extension of the lockdown will cause additional costs of between â‚¬25 and â‚¬57 billion and therefore a decrease in growth of 0.7 to 1.6 percentage points.   READ MORE: Coronavirus: How France and Germany are 'most exposed' to pandemic [ANALYSIS]EU crisis: BBCâ€™s Adler explains how coronavirus sparked Brussels row [INSIGHT]Italian journalist accuses Germany of coronavirus cover-up: 'Shame!' [REVEALED]    Therefore an extension from one to two months pushes costs up by up to to 230 billion euros, or 6.5 percentage points of growth. Mr Fuest added: ""The crisis also leads to massive upheavals on the job market. ""These dwarf the situation at the height of the financial crisis.""  In the various scenarios considered by the Ifo, up to 1.4 million full-time jobs could be lost. Without taking into account extensive planned guarantees and potential Europe-wide rescue packages, public budgets will be burdened by an additional 200 billion euros. Mr Fuest said: ""For overall economic stabilisation, however, the reduced income from taxes and additional expenditure, especially for transfers, are desirable and necessary.""  Speaking last week Mrs Merkel, who it was today confirmed had tested negative for COVID-19, said during a live broadcast to the nation: ""The situation is serious. Take it seriously.

476,"Your Money - Separation anxiety: Divorce, money and coronavirus - Reuters",Beth Pinsker,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The first few days of staying at home for coronavirus seclusion with my two kids were chaotic, stressful and scary, much like they were for everyone else. And then they left for their dadâ€™s house. Suddenly alone in total quiet, it was torture. My head filled with anxious questions and what-ifs. One peek at social media told me I was not alone. â€œThereâ€™s no pandemic clause in divorce agreements,â€ said Lauren Behrman, a licensed clinical psychologist who does parent coordination in New York. Behrman is virtually meeting with parents nonstop via Zoom trying to hammer out emergency plans. Custody schedules are maddeningly specific, down to the time and place of the transitions from one parent to the other, with contingencies outlined for school holidays, birthdays and even snow days. But they do not cover what is going on now. The issue is so dire that the Texas Supreme Court weighed in with an emergency order on March 13 that divorced couples should go by the originally published school schedule. That is not enough guidance for most. One couple has a situation where one parent just returned from international travel and was supposed to quarantine for 14 days, but he wanted to come get a child for regular visitation over the momâ€™s objections. Houston-based divorce attorney Susan Myres, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML), is trying to help a woman whose ex-husband took their son out of the country because he decided the United States was not safe. â€œI donâ€™t know how weâ€™ll ever get him home,â€ Myres said. New York divorce attorney Heidi A. Tallentire said that in cases where one parent takes a child away without consent - even just to go to grandparents or a vacation home - the courts could be harsh upon their return. Consequences could be anything from mandating makeup time to losing custody altogether, but it will all have to wait. Also hanging in the balance for many families is child support and other divorce-related financial settlements. One of Tallentireâ€™s clients closed his small business this week and wanted an immediate modification, which is retroactive to the date you file. â€œBut you canâ€™t file because the court is closed,â€ Tallentire said. Here is advice for divorced parents left to sort this out on their own: 1. Be reasonable Nobody is coming to your rescue, so work it out. The AAML and the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts put out seven recommendations that all revolve around a theme of kindness and mindfulness. (bit.ly/3a6Ikf7) 2. Get whatever help you can You may be able to find a parenting coordinator who will take new clients in an emergency. Note that these professionals typically charge $200 to $400 per hour, but some will work on a sliding scale. Your local courthouse should have online resources. You can also consult a therapist or lean on family members for your own anxiety. 3. Document You do not need to pay a lawyer to hash out little changes to your parenting plan. Anything you mutually agree on is fine, you just need to write it down. It can simply be an email that says, just to confirm, Iâ€™m picking up Johnny at 2 p.m. on Tuesday at your house and you will come get him from my house the following Sunday at 3 p.m., Tallentire said. 4. Agree on your family bubble A friend had a really awkward discussion with his ex-wife about his new girlfriend because of coronavirus, but it had to happen because of how many people were going to be in their social chain over the course of this situation. Their nuclear family now included their twin boys, his girlfriend and her teenage daughter, that kidâ€™s father and whoever else was in his orbit. On her side was her boyfriend and his two kids, plus their mother and her significant other. â€œIf she had said I couldnâ€™t date anymore, I would have been apoplectic,â€ my friend told me. â€œBut the truth is, whatever you do affects everything in your whole life.â€ 5.

82,Coronavirus study identifies ‘gain of function for efficient spread in humans’,CALLUM HOARE,"COVID-19 has now infected nearly 120,000 people, killing more than 4,600 in the process in a devastating outbreak which has now been declared a pandemic. Italy has been placed on lockdown as the infection spreads through Europe at an alarming rate. A study released by Chinese scientists earlier this month found the origin of coronavirus could have come from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a level four biosafety laboratory 12km from the epicentre of the outbreak. Now, a new investigation, titled “Coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade,” suggests it is unlike anything seen before.

Published on ScienceDirect this month, the paper reads: “In 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting humans has emerged in Wuhan, China.

“Its genome has been sequenced and the genomic information promptly released. “Despite a high similarity with the genome sequence of SARS-CoV, we identified a peculiar furin-like cleavage site of the 2019-nCoV, lacking in the other SARS-like CoVs. ""In this article, we discuss the possible functional consequences of this cleavage site in the viral cycle, pathogenicity and its potential implication in the development of antivirals.”

Furin is a ""highly expressed"" protein found in the lungs of humans that could have been used to activate a virus that previously could have only been passed between animals.

The experts believe this “peculiar furin” is an anomaly and could be used to “successfully exploit” enzymes that innate immunity in humans.

The paper goes on to explain how scientist have not seen anything like this in previous strains.

It adds: “Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in other coronaviruses. “Strikingly, the 2019-nCoV sequence contains 12 additional nucleotides upstream of the single cleavage site.”

The paper suggests that this part of the DNA chain has evolved for “gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population compared to other coronaviruses"".

It adds: “This possibly illustrates a convergent evolution pathway between unrelated CoVs.”

The medical definition for gain-of-function, also known as GOF, is a mutation that confers new or enhanced activity on a protein.

But, it can also involve genetic engineering.

According to the US National Library of Medicine, gain-of-function research, ofter simply referred to as GOF, “involves experimentation that aims or is expected to increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogens.

“Such research, when conducted by responsible scientists, usually aims to improve understanding of disease-causing agents, their interaction with human hosts, and/or their potential to cause pandemics.",1,

She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated.

A statement by the researchers said Elisa had complications few hours after taking the vaccine and died while on admission.

Elisa Granato, who is a scientist, was one of the two who received the jab. Four other volunteer are said to be battling complications due to adverse reactions of the vaccine.

Officials say the four persons are being monitored against any adverse effects of the vaccine. Researchers who are awaiting for an autopsy to be conducted believe the Elisa had an underlying health condition which was not disclosed to health officials.

“The four in critical conditions will be fine and these are expected reactions from the vaccines, hence a trial.” the researchers revealed and added that these observations would help improve on the vaccine before it becomes available for use by the public.",1,

372,Cancer symptoms: Signs include ear discharge  | Express.co.uk,Adam Chapman,"  Cancer is an umbrella term for a large number of diseases characterised by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Signs and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected. There are a number of commonly reported symptoms, however, such as fatigue and changes in bowel habits. Cancer can also lead to a number of body changes that you may not readily associate with the disease. One lesser-known sign of cancer is discharge from the ear. According to Cancer Research UK, experiencing this unsettling symptom may signify cancer of the ear canal, the passage running from the outer ear to the middle ear. It is also called the meatus. Other symptoms of ear canal cancer include: READ MORE: Sue Nicholls health: Coronation Street starâ€™s cancer scare was spotted by a loyal fan As Cancer Research UK explains, cancer of the ear is a rare cancer. Most of these cancers start in the skin of the outer ear, such as the ear canal. Between five and 10 out of 100 skin cancers develop on the ear, says the Cancer Research UK. The cause of ear cancer is largely unknown, although people with a history of chronic ear infections have a higher risk of developing cancer in the middle ear, explains the UK charity. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of cancer is to take a small amount of tissue (biopsy) from the abnormal area of the ear, explains Cancer Research UK.

The main treatments for cancer that starts in the ear canal, middle and inner ear are surgery and radiotherapy. As is the case with most cancers, the treatment you have depends on:  According to Macmillan UK, everyone has a certain risk of developing cancer - a combination of genes, lifestyle and environment can affect this risk. â€œHaving one or more risk factors does not mean you will get cancer. Also, having no risk factors does not mean you will not develop cancer,â€ explains the charity. For most people, increasing age is the biggest risk factor for developing cancer, with people over the age of 65 having the greatest risk, says the health site. While you cannot influence the ageing process, it is thought that around one in three cases of the most common cancers could be prevented by eating a healthy diet, keeping to a healthy weight and being more active.  In addition to reducing the risk of cancer, a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of heart disease, a major killer both in the UK and worldwide. According to the NHS, a low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, which should include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (five portions a day) and whole grains. How much exercise a week should you do to reap the health benefits? â€œAdults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week,â€ recommends the NHS. You should also do strengthening activities that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms) on at least two days a week, it adds.

Royal expert Angela Levin lashed out at the Duke of Sussex on Twitter, saying: ""Real shame he is not here to help. ""Perhaps he'll think we are not such a rotten country after all."" Prince Harry told the podcast's host, Michael Coates, he was incredibly proud to see veterans joining an army of hundreds of thousands people helping those in need at such dire times.

88,"NO KIDDING No case of child passing on coronavirus to an adult exists, scientists say",Thomas Burrows,"NO young child has been found to have passed coronavirus to an adult, a new study has found.

Analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on kids show it is likely they ""do not play a significant role"" in spreading the deadly virus. There has not been a single case of a child under 10 passing on coronavirus in contact tracing carried out by the World Health Organisation.

The study, by the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health, found the evidence ""consistently demonstrates reduced infection and infectivity of children in the transmission chain"".

Dr Alasdair Munro, a clinical research fellow in paediatric infectious diseases, said: ""Covid-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection. There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare. The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role.""

It was revealed this week that a nine-year-old boy who contracted Covid-19 in Eastern France did not pass the virus on despite coming into contact with more than 170 people.

The boy was among a number of cases linked to Steve Walsh, the businessman who became the first Brit to test positive for coronavirus after attending a sales conference in Singapore in January. Switzerland has announced it will allow kids under ten to visit and hug grandparents again.

The Federal Office of Public Health claimed children pose ""no risk"" to the elderly but said contact should be kept brief.

According to valuable information from Italian pathologists, ventilators and intensive care units were never needed.
Autopsies performed by the Italian pathologists has shown that it is not pneumonia but it is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Thrombosis) which ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. If this is true for all cases, that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected. However, protocols are currently being changed in Italy who have been adversely affected by this pandemic.

The next day they woke up as if nothing had happened to them! Well, the scientific information that follows proves they are right! This information was released by a medical researcher from Italy: “Thanks to 50 autopsies performed on patients who died of COVID-19, Italian pathologists have discovered that IT IS NOT PNEUMONIA, strictly speaking, because the virus does not only kill pneumocytes of this type, but uses an inflammatory storm to create an endothelial vascular thrombosis.”

On June 19, 2015, the UK government-funded Pirbright Institute filed an application for a patent for the live coronavirus, which was approved on Nov 20, 2018.

Suspiciously, a Pirbright Institute “primary funder” is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Specifically, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated $189,232 to the Pirbright Institute in a 2013 grant looking “to improve our understanding of, and effective use of, current control tools and measures (including vaccines) against peste des petits rumiAnonymousts and foot and mouth disease, two serious diseases affecting livestock that are widespread in developing countries.”

Then, in November of 2019, the Pirbright Institute’s website published an articlefocusing on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s funding of “a Livestock Antibody Hub” to the sum of $5.5 million.

“The ambitious programme of work will see extensive collaboration between multiple UK research organisations in order to utilise research outcomes in livestock disease and immunology to support human health as part of the ‘One Health’ agenda,” the Pirbright Institute wrote last November.

Professor John Hammond, the lead researcher on the program, said, “New technology has given us the opportunity to utilise these detailed antibody responses to make the next generation of vaccines and therapies, which will improve animal health and ultimately human health, as well as ensuring the security of our food supply.”

Additionally, at the same time the Pirbright Institute announced the Livestock Antibody Hub program, they posted a job opening for a 4-year Postdoctoral Scientist position on LinkedIn.com.

The advertisement for the job opening explains, “The post-holder will report to the Heads of the Coronavirus Group and the Viral Oncogenesis Group work and will work closely with a multidisciplinary team to advance the aims of the overall Pirbright Livestock Antibody Hub.”

Keep in mind, this all took place prior to the current Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.

Bill And Melinda Gates Behind Global Pandemic Excercise Focusing On Coronavirus

Meanwhile, on Oct. 18, 2019, also before the outbreak, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the World Economic Forum co-hosted an event in NYC where “policymakers, business leaders, and health officials” worked together on a simulated coronavirus outbreak.

Titled the “Event 201” pandemic, the high-level pandemic exercise “dropped participants right in the midst of an uncontrolled coronavirus outbreak that was spreading like wildfire out of South America to wreak worldwide havoc.”

“In the simulation, CAPS (the coronavirus) resulted in a death toll of 65 million people within 18 months,” according to John Hopkins University.

A video highlight reel from the event shows fictional newscasters from “GNN” discuss how the hypothetical immune-resistant virus (nicknamed CAPS) was crippling trade and travel, sending the global economy into freefall.

It just so happens that a professor from Imperial College London recently warned the coronavirus has the same kill rate as the Spanish flu, which claimed the lives of 20-50 million people in 1918.",1,

188,"Social Distancing' is Snake Oil, Not Science",William Sullivan,"Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York says that it’s “shocking” to discover that 66 percent of new hospitalizations appear to have been among people “largely sheltering at home.” 

“We thought maybe they were taking public transportation,” he said, “but actually no, because these people were literally at home.”

“Much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself,” he continues.  “Everything closed down, government has done everything it could, society has done everything it could.”

It’s your fault, he says to the hospitalized New Yorkers who loyally complied with his government directive.  But here’s an interesting alternative theory as to why, mostly, old people who are staying at home are being hospitalized.  What if the government directive to close everything down and mandate “social distancing” actually made the problem worse?

Dr. David Katz predicted precisely this outcome on March 20, in an article that is proving every bit as correct in its predictions and sober policy recommendations as Dr. Anthony Fauci has been proven incorrect -- which is another way of saying that the article has proven flawless, so far. 

Dr. Katz writes:

[I]n more and more places we are limiting gatherings uniformly, a tactic I call “horizontal interdiction” — when containment policies are applied to the entire population without consideration of their risk for severe infection.

But as the work force is laid off en masse (our family has one adult child home for that reason already), and colleges close (we have another two young adults back home for this reason), young people of indeterminate infectious status are being sent home to huddle with their families nationwide. And because we lack widespread testing, they may be carrying the virus and transmitting it to their 50-something parents, and 70- or 80-something grandparents. If there are any clear guidelines for behavior within families — what I call “vertical interdiction” — I have not seen them.

One might be inclined to simply accept this as an unintended consequence of “social distancing,” but accepting that would require there to be some kind of benefit to “social distancing” that would make it worth the cost.  Is there?

Very likely, you already instinctively know that the guidelines suggesting that it’s somehow helpful to keep a six-foot space between healthy people, even outdoors, is not based on science, but just an arbitrary suggestion we’ve been conditioned to accept without evidence.

And your gut feeling would be right.  There’s a reason that “social distancing” wasn’t a buzzword common to the American lexicon prior to 2020.  There’s very little science behind “social distancing” at all. 

“It turns out,” Julie Kelly writes at American Greatness, “as I wrote last month, “social distancing” is untested pseudoscience particularly as it relates to halting the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On its website, the CDC provides no links to any peer-reviewed social distancing studies that bolster its official guidance.” 

There’s a reason for the lack of peer-reviewed studies on the CDC website.  She continues:

The alarming reality is that social distancing never has been tested on a massive scale in the modern age; its current formula was conceived during George W. Bush’s administration and met with much-deserved skepticism.

“People could not believe that the strategy would be effective or even feasible,” one scientist told the New York Times last month. A high school science project—no, I am not joking—added more weight to the concept.

“Social distancing” is very much a newfangled experiment, not settled science.  And, Kelley writes, the results are suggesting that our “Great Social Distancing Experiment of 2020” will be “near the top of the list” of “bad experiments gone horribly wrong.”

You also don’t have to be a scientist to also instinctively know that “two weeks to flatten the curve” becoming “America must lock down until a vaccine is created” is more social experimentation than science.  But what the data have fleshed out, beyond the point of argument, is that the proximity of one human being to another has proven to be a very small factor in determining the impact of Covid-19 infections. What’s far more important is which human beings happen to be in close proximity of one another. 

According to Dr. Steven Shapiro and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center:

Crowded indoor conditions can be devastating in nursing homes, while on the USS Theodore Roosevelt 1,102 sailors were infected, but only 7 required hospitalization, with 1 death. This contrast has significant implications that we have not embraced. Epidemiologic prediction models have performed poorly, often neglecting critical variables.

The USS Theodore Roosevelt had a crew of 4,800.  Given the acute sample, testing was holistic.  This yields an actual infection rate of roughly 23 percent, and among those infected, the fatality rate is 0.09 percent.  Among the Roosevelt’s entire crew of assumedly healthy and able-bodied sailors, on a floating Petri dish, during the thick of viral outbreak that shut down all schools and placed healthy citizens across America under house-arrest, the fatality rate was .002 percent. 

It seems more than obvious that there is little sense in quarantining the young and healthy.  As Dr. Shapiro also observes:

Our outcomes are similar to the state of Pennsylvania, where the median age of death from COVID-19 is 84 years old.  The few younger patients who died all had significant preexisting conditions.  Very few children were infected and none died.  Minorities in our communities fared equally well as others, but we know that this is not the case nationally.  In sum, this is a disease of the elderly, sick, and poor.

Here’s another thing you likely already know.  Politicians and the media are committing to damage control to hide all of these facts from you.  In fact, finding any news relating to Dr. Shapiro’s somewhat revelatory comments online is, so far, quite difficult. 

That’s because, for the people who pushed “social distancing” and destroying the economy as an absolutely necessary evil, this is a matter of self-preservation.  If this information were widely known, citizens might be more inclined to demand that schools and parks and restaurants and malls be opened.  But if schools open tomorrow, without testing, and there is not a surge in hospitalizations or deaths, then the obvious question is why the schools closed in the first place.  If restaurants and other shuttered businesses open without a spike in hospitalizations and deaths, then why did they ever close? 

There’s value in the media and government officials maintaining the public perception that the costs of “social distancing” have been offset by its benefits.  But while those benefits are elusive in the data, and require mountains of presumption to imagine that they even exist at all, the costs of “social distancing” couldn’t be clearer.

As Dr. Steven Shapiro concludes:

What we cannot do, is extended social isolation. Humans are social beings, and we are already seeing the adverse mental health consequences of loneliness, and that is before the much greater effects of economic devastation take hold on the human condition....

In this particular case, the problem we’re not going to be able to fix in the short term is the complete eradication of the virus. The problem we can fix is to serve and protect our seniors, especially those in nursing homes. If we do that, we can reopen society, and though infectious cases may rise as in the Theodore Roosevelt, the death rate will not, providing time for the development of treatments and vaccines.

At this point, this is little more than common sense, and the truth can’t continue to be suppressed for much longer.  It’s becoming more and more obvious that it’s well past time to take a more tactical approach to mitigation, as Dr. Katz suggested back on March 20, allocating resources and efforts toward protecting and caring for those most at-risk, and ending this soul-crushing and economy-crashing experiment with holistic “social distancing.”",1,
282,Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz reach agreement on emergency government for Israel - CNN,"Andrew Carey, Amir Tal and Oren Liebermann, CNN","Jerusalem (CNN) Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz have agreed on the formation of a national emergency government, according to a joint statement from Blue and White and Netanyahu's Likud party. The announcement, which includes a timeline for potential annexation of parts of the West Bank over the summer, appears to bring to an end more than a year of political deadlock during which Israel held three general elections. Gantz had campaigned in all three national polls promising that he would not be part of government with an indicted Prime Minister but broke with his Blue and White allies almost a month ago when he announced he was seeking a unity government with Netanyahu. ""We prevented a fourth election,"" Gantz tweeted Monday evening after the announcement of an agreement, adding, ""We will safeguard the democracy, we will fight the coronavirus and we will take care of all the citizens of Israel."" Netanyahu echoed the message of unity in a tweet of his own. Read More ""I promised the state of Israel a national emergency government that will act to save the lives and livelihoods of the citizens of Israel. I will continue to do everything for you, citizens of Israel,"" he said. The agreement sets a date of July 1 from which the process to annex parts of the West Bank, as envisioned in the Trump administration's peace plan, can begin. Under the Trump plan, Israel can expect to receive the United States' support for the application of Israeli sovereignty over all settlements in the territory as well as the Jordan Valley, which lies along the border with Jordan. The new government agreement does not spell out exactly which bits of territory are earmarked for annexation, but instead commits Netanyahu and Gantz to approach the issue ""with the full understanding of the US ... and with international dialogue in the matter."" Responding to the announcement, Palestine Liberation Organization Secretary General Saeb Erakat said in a statement annexation would mean ""the end of any possibility for a negotiated solution"" between Israelis and Palestinians. ""The new Israeli government has two options: open the doors for a meaningful peace process or to further jeopardize any hope for peace,"" Erakat said. Under the terms of the new government agreement, Netanyahu will continue as Prime Minister for a further 18 months, after which he will step aside and Gantz will take over. If Netanyahu resigns before the end of his year and a half, the agreement sees Gantz taking over as leader of a transitional government. During the first part of the rotation arrangement, Gantz will be known as the Alternate Prime Minister, and his Blue and White party will hold the key position of Defense Minister, as well as Foreign Minister. But it could still be several weeks before a new government is sworn-in. Even though Gantz has agreed to let Netanyahu remain as Prime Minister, Israel's President Reuven Rivlin is required by law to give Netanyahu the mandate to form a new government. At that point, it is possible there will be a fresh petition submitted to the High Court to declare Netanyahu's mandate illegal because of his criminal indictments. Netanyahu has been indicted on charges of bribery and breach of trust; he insists he is innocent, calling the charges an attempted coup. If the High Court were to find in favor of the petitioners then Israel could yet find itself facing a fourth general election in the summer.",0,
17,FLORIDA HOSPITAL REPORTS A CORONAVIRUS ‘INFESTATION’ WITH MULTIPLE CONFIRMED PATIENTS,Anonymous,"letter to its patients and staff. The letter, obtained by Your Content, is dated March 1, 2020 and confirms the hospital is now on red alert following a CDC notification that a patient has tested positive in their building. According to a source who was briefed on the entire situation, a total at least three but possibly as many as 8 individuals have been exposed. However, that figure does not include individuals that might’ve contracted the virus prior to the patient’s initial arrival, the source says. “We’ve been asked to stay silent on the issue until the CDC has time to assess the damages,” the source said, speaking only under the condition of anonymity. TOMORROW I WILL BE IN TAMPA AND MIAMI WITH SURGEON GENERAL RIVKEES AND OTHER OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS OUR CONTINUED STATEWIDE RESPONSE ON #COVID19. HTTPS://T.CO/SMRWKQLYOI — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) March 2, 2020
“I could confirm there are at least three individuals being placed under extreme care — one remains in isolation and has tested positive for the coronavirus.” The source noted they are awaiting the results from approximately 8 tests that were subsequently sent out after the patient tested positive. “Doctors Hospital of Sarosota has been notified by the Centers for Disease Control that we have a patient in our facility who presumptively tested positive for COVID-19,” the release reads. “This patient was admitted to our facility in late February, and remains in our care. On Friday, Feb. 28th, the CDC changed its guidance regarding COVID-19, specifically, the criteria for persons under investigation (PUI), which consequently activated all protocols for handling potential COVID-19 cases, including immediate isolation.” Florida hospital reports a coronavirus 'infestation' with multiple confirmed patients.“All potentially exposed individuals have been identified. We are working very closely with the local and state departments of health as well as the CDC to assure that we continue to take all appropriate precautions,” the release goes on to say.

BOTH INDIVIDUALS ARE ISOLATED AND BEING APPROPRIATELY CARED FOR. — Florida Dept. Health (@HealthyFla) March 2, 2020
“Just as we have done with seasonal flu and tuberculosis, we identify and treat infectious diseases while minimizing risk. By being aware of the very latest recommendations of the CDC, Doctors Hospital of Sarosota was able to identify this patient and pursue testing at the very earliest opportunity.” “Please know that the safety of our patients, colleagues and community is of the utmost concern,” the release declares. The recent widespread outbreak of the respiratory disease stemmed from a novel coronavirus that was first detected in China and which has now been detected in 60 locations internationally, including in the United States. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. During the week of February 23, CDC reported community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in California (in two places), Oregon and Washington. Community spread in Washington resulted in the first death in the United States from COVID-19, as well as the first reported case of COVID-19 in a health care worker, and the first potential outbreak in a long-term care facility. The CDC affirms that there are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. HOW WILL THE CORONAVIRUS IMPACT MY COMMUNITY?
More cases of the coronavirus are likely to be identified in the coming days, according to the CDC. That includes a rapid increase in cases in the United States. It’s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in communities in the United States. It’s likely that at some point, widespread transmission of the coronavirus in the United States will occur. Widespread transmission of the coronavirus would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against the coronavirus and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions would be the most important response strategy.",1,

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been stopped from working under their royal titles by the Queen. Since moving to LA, the royal couple have been offered a chance to be interviewed about being in the royal family. Royal expert Angela Mollard has warned the couple from doing so and said the interview would be a car crash.

147,A Curious Analogy – Coronavirus Misrepresentations Follow Srebrenica Script,"Stephen Karganovic
","As the contemporary Corona virus hysteria narrative continues to collapse (here and here) another dubious narrative, launched a quarter of a century ago – Srebrenica genocide – comes to mind. The common thread of both narratives is that they have just enough genuine elements to provide a seemingly plausible foundation for a vastly exaggerated tale. The Covid-19 virus can endanger health, and even be lethal, to certain classes of the population, but how much more than that is it? In Srebrenica in July of 1995, about a thousand Muslim prisoners were executed by a rogue outfit of the Serb army. That being said, neither situation was selected by humanists for special promotion, they both serve cynical political agendas conceived for fundamentally anti-human purposes.

The virus epidemic is a tool for achieving a new level of regimentation for mankind and for elitist restructuring of the neo-liberal fiAnonymouscial and economic system, while its victims cower helplessly under curfew, in fear of contagion. The ambitious Srebrenica operation was conceived, under cover of sanctimonious cant, also as a tool to achieve several strategically important objectives. The main one, as it turned out, was to furnish a rationale for the cynically misnamed Right to Protect doctrine, enabling Western imperialist powers to arrogate to themselves the sole right of intervening to “rescue” endangered nations. In the process, several million innocent Muslim lives, many times the number of alleged Srebrenica victims, were pitilessly sacrificed for the plunder of their countries´ coveted natural resources and geopolitical advantage.

Neither narrative would have succeeded without the unconditional support of the corrupt globalist media, drowning out critical voices which recommended a careful study of the facts and a cautious approach to drawing momentous conclusions without solid evidence. Through alternative news sources, we are now learning extremely interesting things about the dreaded Covid-19. It seems that this type of virus is quite common, at least in its laboratory-unmodified form, that it is not necessarily lethal unless certain very stringent conditions are met, and that it is not even as easily communicable as the induced hysteria has claimed. Over a much longer period of time, since Srebrenica in 1995, we have learned that there is no forensic evidence to support nearly 8,000 executions and that a considerable quantity of remains of men killed in combat was callously misrepresented as belonging to execution victims. All the exhumed bodies around Srebrenica were automatically adjudged to belong to execution victims who were subjected to genocide. Similarly, anybody dying today with even a trace of Corona virus in their system is automatically listed as a victim of the pandemic, so publicly cited statistics could be made to look more intimidating.

Oddly, or perhaps not, when speaking of statistics, in both cases they utterly fail to buttress the official story. A careful comparison of mortality data for the United Kingdom over the last several years and this year, since the officially proclaimed pandemic began, shows no significant increase in recorded deaths. Would the situation be found to be different in other countries if their data were studied as meticulously? Similarly, after the “genocide,” in Srebrenica the Muslim population continued to be in the majority and for many years controlled the local administration. A Serb mayor finally was elected quite recently, supported by many disgruntled Muslim voters mainly because his predecessor was seen as incompetent and corrupt.

Another notable parallel is that making waves about either narrative, Covid-19 or Srebrenica, is not a good idea and can result in social and professional ostracism. Both narratives serve as the norm of political correctness in their respective spheres. Denial, or even insistence on a nuanced alternative explanation, is without examination equally scorned as a “conspiracy theory.” Wikipedia features a meticulous listing of “Srebrenica genocide deniers” so that they may be exposed to deserved public calumny for their heretical views. A similar hit list of “coronavirus deniers” has also emerged recently. Strategies for getting “coronavirus sceptics” into the right-thinking fold are being actively developed. When persuasion is no longer enough, what will come next?

The officially sacralized narratives, both Srebrenica and now Coronavirus, have tested human credulity to the limit. May we ever be allowed to question protected tales, even when under the onslaught of facts they make less and less sense? As Peter Hitchens has cogently argued, the demise of critical thinking (as well as common sense) in the fabled West has taken an alarming turn:

“We demonstrated, in fact, that we don’t really have a civil society any longer. What shocked me having spent such a long time in the Soviet Union is that under the Soviet Union’s rule most people regarded it with a certain amount of contempt, made jokes about it, realized they were being mocked and fooled. In this case the population accept what they’re being told without any question. It’s extraordinary. The old USSR would have loved to have a population like the current western world which actually genuinely believe the propaganda and does what it’s told.”

427,EXCLUSIVE-Bayer's chloroquine donation to U.S. raises concern about FDA standards in pandemic - Reuters,Katherine Eban,"April 16 (Reuters) - On March 21, two days after President Donald Trump first touted chloroquine drugs as a â€œgamechangerâ€ in the fight against COVID-19, administration officials privately described what they felt was a â€œwinâ€ in the presidentâ€™s efforts to build an emergency stockpile of the drugs: a hefty donation of pills from Bayer AG. In an exchange of enthusiastic emails among federal health officials reviewed by Reuters, Keagan Lenihan, chief of staff of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cautioned that â€œ3-4 daysâ€ of testing would be needed. â€œPotentially serious issues with product so letâ€™s be careful when we take that win,â€ she wrote. Bayer has since donated three million tablets of the drug, called Resochin, to the U.S. national stockpile for treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. After a brief period of testing, its use in the United States was approved on an emergency basis. But three U.S. government sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that there is reason to be concerned about the quality of Resochin and its makers, located in India and Pakistan. Although some rules can be waived in an emergency, the FDA dropped its quality-control standards too far as it scoured the world for scarce supplies of chloroquine drugs, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The plants that make Resochin ingredients and finished doses in India and Pakistan have never been registered with, or inspected by, the FDA, according to the three government sources, as well as FDA documents compiled in the private online database FDAzilla.com. Some chloroquine drugs were already approved by the FDA before the pandemic as antimalarial medications, a process that required plant inspections. Resochin was not approved. Pakistani regulators, who inspected Bayerâ€™s Resochin plant in Karachi in 2015, found a â€œgross failureâ€ in manufacturing processes there, according to documents from the Drugs Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, reviewed by Reuters. And though the FDA has never screened the Indore, India, plant that supplies ingredients for Resochin, the U.S. agency has inspected other Indian plants run by the same Indian supplier and found serious deficiencies, including falsification of records, inspection documents spanning 2014 through 2019 show. Responding to questions from Reuters about Resochin, FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said that the agency â€œsampled and tested the donated drugs to evaluate acceptability for importationâ€ and they met appropriate standards. Asked about Lenihanâ€™s March 21 email, the FDA spokesman said the agency â€œdoes not comment on alleged, leaked emails.â€ In a statement to Reuters, Bayer said that the FDA had tested Resochin â€œand found it to be of appropriate quality for release to the (stockpile) for emergency use.  We are proud to make this donation to the U.S. government in the fight against COVID-19.â€ Resochin is part of a class of medications containing one of two active ingredients - chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine - that the Trump administration has praised as a potentially lifesaving treatment. But the effectiveness of chloroquine drugs against coronavirus has not been proven. Though in use for years in the United States as a treatment for malaria and autoimmune conditions such as lupus, the medicines can have serious side effects, including heart arrhythmias. The three U.S. sources who spoke with Reuters, as well as an independent expert, said spot-testing is not always sufficient to ensure a drugâ€™s safety and effectiveness, and plant inspections normally done by the FDA are crucial to ensuring overall quality. â€œIf youâ€™re talking about millions of doses, you canâ€™t test every product,â€ said Stephen Payne, who for years chaired a practice group specializing in the FDA and health care at a global law firm. â€œYou have no idea what you donâ€™t know.â€ Trump first endorsed chloroquine drugs to treat COVID-19 from the White House podium on March 19, citing â€œvery, very encouraging early resultsâ€ and downplaying any risks. â€œIf things donâ€™t go as planned, itâ€™s not going to kill anyone,â€ he said. The statements came as the administration was being hammered for its slow response to the growing coronavirus crisis, which to date has infected more than 637,000 people in the United States, killing almost 31,000. His comments set high public expectations for the drugs, which are now being snapped up all over the globe. In emails two days later, federal health officials greeted the Bayer donation of chloroquine phosphate, or Resochin, with eagerness. Cicely Waters, director of external affairs for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), saw a media opportunity. A shipment of two million tablets was due to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. â€œI would like to get photos of the product coming off of the FedEx plane so we can be prepared to support the story with visuals if this turns out the way we hope,â€ wrote Waters. Lenihan of the FDA told the group of health officials that â€œif it is the product we think it is and it is not toxic we will release it to ASPRâ€ - the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, a division within HHS. Reached by email, Lenihan referred Reuters back to the FDA press office. Waters did not respond to an email seeking comment. One of the participants in the March 21 email discussion appeared to raise the issue of which agency should get credit for the deal. Joseph Hamel, ASPRâ€™s manager of strategic innovation and emerging technology, asked in an email to the group: â€œHow do you want to handle? FDA win? ASPR win? Happy either way, please let us know.â€ Hamel did not return an email seeking comment. Asked about the email exchanges, an HHS spokesman echoed the FDAâ€™s statement, saying the agency would not comment on â€œalleged, leaked emails.â€ The pills and ingredients welcomed by the administration had origins that should have raised red flags and prompted greater scrutiny, said the three sources who spoke to Reuters. In 2015, Bayerâ€™s plant in Pakistan, Bayer Pakistan Private Ltd, was cited by that countryâ€™s regulators for making Resochin that was lower in potency than labeled, according to inspection documents reviewed by Reuters. A whistleblower complaint led to the discovery of more than 21 million Resochin tablets that were too weak, more than 12% under the specified weight of 400 milligrams, according to the Pakistani regulatory records. Officials blamed the problem on a â€œgross failureâ€ of manufacturing operations, citing improperly calibrated machines, poorly trained workers and insufficient staffing. Weak medications can fail to treat the illness for which theyâ€™re prescribed and harm patients. The investigation was ultimately resolved with Bayerâ€™s agreement to destroy the 21 million doses. Regarding the 2015 incident, the company told Reuters: â€œAll batches produced with lower content due to an error in production were never released, the corresponding batches destroyed.â€ According to FDA records reviewed by Reuters, the active ingredients for the drug are made at a plant in Indore, India, run by Ipca Laboratories Ltd, an Indian drug manufacturer and ingredient supplier that exports its products globally. In 2016, the FDA issued a warning letter to Ipca regarding three of its plants in India that make chloroquine ingredients and finished pills for companies other than Bayer. The plants did not include the one making the active ingredient for Bayerâ€™s Resochin. Nonetheless, the U.S. government sources said, Ipcaâ€™s troubled history calls into question its general practices. The FDA found the company was deleting, manipulating and fabricating laboratory data, according to the agencyâ€™s records. The company vowed at the time to â€œresolve these issues at the earliest.â€ In 2017, the agency restricted drugs and ingredients from those three plants from entering the U.S. market, a regulatory sanction called an import alert. Then in August 2019, the FDA accused one of the Ipca plants of a â€œcascade of failureâ€ for not properly maintaining its quality data, agency records show. Ipca did not respond to questions from Reuters about its track record with the FDA. On March 20, a day after Trump praised the antimalarial drug from the podium, the FDA lifted its import alert for Ipcaâ€™s chloroquine ingredients and completed tablets from the three restricted plants, according to a March 21 statement filed by Ipca with the Indian stock exchange. The company pledged in the statement to adhere to stringent manufacturing standards, â€œand thus help mankind in the best possible way in these testing times.â€ Katherine Eban reported from New York; Editing by Elyse Tanouye and Julie Marquis",0,
356,The country is staring at the worst economic slump in 300 years says NICK FERRARI | Nick Ferrari | Columnists | Comment | Express.co.uk,Nick Ferrari," Writer and LBC radio presenter The report from the Office for Budget Responsibility painted an unimaginable picture of economic and employment woe. Before drilling too deep into the depressing detail, and as it's vital to try to find and then amplify any positives, it should also be stated the same forecasts also point to the UK roaring out of the possible recession, albeit after suffering a world of pain. The country is staring at the worst economic slump in 300 years. To give some context, after the First World War and the ensuing Spanish flu pandemic, Britain's output, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP), fell by more than five per cent.  In the Wall Street Crash and Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, there was a five per cent drop. The Second World War knocked GDP by 10 per cent and more recently, the 2008 economic crash and credit crunch hit GDP by 4.2 per cent. This lockdown is predicted to hit our output by a truly staggering 13 per cent over the course of the year, making it about the same as two world wars and the fiscal meltdown from the last decade added together! The picture regarding unemployment is just as foreboding. Unemployment, at 3.8 per cent before the coronavirus crisis, is predicted to soar to 10 per cent with two million people losing their jobs in one quarter alone. If you've been able to leave your home and visit your local high street or stores (possibly during your solitary hour of prescribed exercise) you'll know it's a deeply depressing sight. Bustle has been replaced with bust. Restaurants, bars, pubs and coffee shops are shuttered up. Most other shops are closed. Offices and factories are locked down as enforced hibernation goes on. Regrettably, despite a blizzard of our cash, many will never re-open leaving some businesses shattered and jobs destroyed. Millions are being paid, again by us taxpayers, just to stay at home.  Only history will reveal whether there ever was an option, but once this Government was days - and it really was just a matter of days - late in taking action, the grim truth is there was no choice. But now, missed opportunities have to be put behind us. Along with the failure to deliver PPE and ventilators on time - and a near-criminal incompetence in looking after our most vulnerable in care homes and conducting testing, this is the chance the Government has to get the Good Ship GB back on course and ready to navigate the desperately choppy financial seas that lie ahead. Without its star communicator and lifelong eternal cheerleader for this nation at the helm it will be tough. Boris Johnson is simply an impossible act to emulate, but a detailed and competent exit strategy needs to be laid out before the public. We have been spectacularly patient and compliant and, when you remember the population is just under 67 million, it only takes a very small percentage to disobey the restrictions to make it look like widespread dissent. In truth, that hasn't happened and is to the credit of virtually all of us.   The Government must keep a close eye on developments elsewhere in Europe and finesse its policy. In Italy, where more than 20,000 have died, bookshops and clothing stores have opened. In Spain it's been building sites and small businesses and in Austria garden centres, DIY stores and small shops. In the UK, surely gyms and fitness studios must be among the first to be free to trade, in a bid to get us fit again. The British people have - as always - done their bit. They now deserve, and crave, the route map to happier times.

We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK.â€ 2. â€œWe need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that weâ€™ve moved beyond the peak.â€ 3. â€œWe need to have reliable data from SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.â€ 4. â€œWe need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.â€ 5. â€œThis is really crucial: we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.

105,Pelosi Won’t Pass Stimulus Checks Unless Seniors Are Excluded,Harry Helmet,"No one knows why the Democrats hate senior citizens so much. They do everything that they can to screw our nation’s retirees, trying to screw them out of Social Security, screw them out of Medicare, and now they want to screw them out of their stimulus checks.
Anonymouscy Pelosi and her colleagues have been endlessly stalling the stimulus bill. They filled it was so much pork, that all that was left for the people was $1200 each. Had it not been for all of her additions, we would have been entitled to $10,000 each. If that wasn’t enough, Pelosi now wants to take more funds for her pet projects, and fiAnonymousce them by taking stimulants away from senior citizens.
The Speaker of the House presented this latest stalling technique to congress today:
“The stimulus is being delivered in order to keep our economy rolling. It needs to go to those who spend so that money continues to flow. Seniors don’t spend money. They sock it all away in a cookie jar or under a mattress, saving it for a rainy day that never comes. They’re idiots and, if anything, they are destructive to the economy of the United States.
And besides, they get Social Security. They’re already living off the government dime, getting a handout each and every month because they’re too lazy to work for a living. Why would we give them more?
Seniors will just have to do with they always do. They should be thankful that we’re still willing to treat them if they catch this thing. If it were completely up to me, I’d toss them away.”
Pelosi is the most uncaring witch this country’s government has ever seen. In our entire history, we have not witnessed such sadistic behavior from an elected official. She needs to go.",1,
525,'Everything will be all right': message of hope spreads in Italy | World news | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jedidajah-otte,"As Italy is gripped by a countrywide lockdown because of rocketing numbers of coronavirus cases, Italians are trying to boost their morale and have started spreading a slogan of reassurance: â€œAndrÃ  tutto beneâ€ â€“ everything will be all right. Millions of children are stuck at home because their schools and nurseries have closed, and many have started leaving hand-drawn notes in their neighbourhoods, bearing the Italian equivalent to the Cantonese phrase jiayou, translating into â€œdonâ€™t give upâ€ or â€œhang on in thereâ€, that has been used frequently on the streets of China since the outbreak began. The initiative appears to have been started by a few mothers in Bari, Puglia using Facebook, and then picked up across the country. Romina Anardo, 38, a journalist at a local newspaper in Piossasco, a small town near Turin, has been working from home since her five-year-old sonâ€™s school closed because of the outbreak. He drew a rainbow accompanied by the slogan. â€œAfter a moment of panic in the population, there is now a new solidarity,â€ Anardo said. â€œIn my community the drugstores bring groceries to peopleâ€™s homes and there is a group of volunteers that visit houses of people over 65.â€ Marta Achler, a human rights lawyer who lives in Florence with her family, said the activity helped her two young children, aged five and seven, cope with a frightening situation. â€œThey know they are in the low-risk group, but they worry about us and I think kids know that the elderly are at risk mostly, so my children worry most about their beloved grandparents. That is why this was such an uplifting experience for them, and to see their friends are doing it too,â€ she said. â€œWe may be isolated here, but the message of hope is spreading.â€ Luisella Romeo, 52, a tour guide from Venice, has not been able to work since 29 February. She said: â€œWhen I look out of my window, I see this huge banner saying, â€˜AndrÃ  tutto bene.â€™ The message helps. Venice is quite a strong community, we all know each other. The slogan doesnâ€™t mean â€˜relax, stop being vigilantâ€™, it means â€˜Donâ€™t give up!â€™â€ She was hopeful that the lockdown would be lifted by the end of April. â€œBut maybe then it will be worse in other countries, and Italy wonâ€™t allow foreign tourists to enter,â€ she said. â€œI am just glad that my husband has a stable job and can work from home now. He is a university professor and tests and papers can be marked without going to the office. â€œItâ€™s human to be scared, but I donâ€™t see panicking, nor acts of selfishness.â€",0,
351,Queen heartbreak: The devastating tradition the Queen has been forced to break | Royal | News | Express.co.uk,Kaisha Langton," The Queen is currently at Windsor Castle where she typically spends each Easter. Over the Easter weekend, churches were forced to remain closed and so the Queen broadcast a message to the nation. It was only the fifth time during her reign where she had undertaken this type of message. But what 68-year-old tradition has the Queen been forced to cancel amid the coronavirus crisis? The Queen spoke to the UK and the Commonwealth in early April. She drew on her experience of wartime spirit and called on the country to â€œremain united and resoluteâ€ amid the coronavirus pandemic. She said: â€œTogether we are tackling this disease and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.â€ The Queen reflected on how difficult it is for people to stay apart from their loved ones. She added: â€œWe should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.â€ READ MORE: Queen's birthday to go unnoticed as Her Majesty cancels celebrations   The Queenâ€™s schedule has already been significantly disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Buckingham Palace garden parties have been cancelled and it has been announced that Trooping the Colour will not go ahead in its traditional form. The Queenâ€™s second eldest granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, has been forced to cancel her wedding which was due to take place on May 29. A source told People: â€œThere are no plans to switch venues or hold a bigger wedding. â€œThey arenâ€™t even thinking about their wedding at this time. â€œThere will come a time to rearrange, but thatâ€™s not yet.â€   Now the 93-year-old monarch has been forced to cancel another big tradition. Buckingham Palace said the Queen did not want any special measures in place to allow gun salutes when she turns 94 on Tuesday, April 21. Traditionally, gun salutes, in which blank rounds are fired from around London, are used to mark special occasions for the Royal Family, such as birthdays and anniversaries. But now it is thought, for the first time in the Queenâ€™s 68-year reign, the traditional gun salutes at Tower of London and Hyde Park will not be fired to mark her birthday.

Instead, it is thought the Queen will spend the day privately at Windsor Castle with her husband Prince Philip, 98. The couple are classed as vulnerable persons and are therefore expected to shield themselves for 12 weeks to protect themselves from coronavirus. Family members are expected to video call her on Tuesday to deliver their birthday wishes.   It is also thought Government buildings will be exempt from flying flags if it creates a problem. The Queen reportedly feels these symbols are inappropriate given the coronavirus death toll stands at more than 150,000 globally, 14,576 of which are from the UK. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has issued flag-flying protocol guidance in light of the coronavirus outbreak. The guidance reads: â€œIn the current circumstances we are not expecting everyone to be able to follow this advice and you should continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines as set out by the Government.â€ During an interview this week, the Queenâ€™s grandson and second-in-line to the throne Prince William said he was concerned for his grandmother and grandfatherâ€™s health. William told the BBC: â€œObviously I think very carefully about my grandparents - who are the age they're at, we're doing everything we can to make sure that they're isolated away and protected from this.â€ He also spoke about his concern for his father, Prince Charles, who contracted coronavirus in March, but has since recovered having experienced mild symptoms. He said: â€œI have to admit, at first I was quite concerned, he fits the profile of somebody, at the age he is at, which is fairly risky. ""My father has had many chest infections, colds, and things like that over the years. â€œAnd so, I thought to myself, if anybody is going to be able to beat this, it's going to be him.â€ See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",0,
277,How to Work Remotely If Your Company Previously Had an Office | Inc.com,Heidi Zak,"As the coronavirus has continued to have a massive impact on the world, more and more companies have been forced to move their entire workforce remote. As the co-CEO of ThirdLove, I can tell you that a month ago, we were not a work-from-home sort of business. If someone needed to, it was fine. But as a culture, we had hundreds of employees showing up to our various offices in San Francisco, Chico, California, and Argentina. We would conference team members in via Google Hangouts, and conduct distributed companywide meetings--but all of them were primarily still held in physical offices. Now, like many other companies, we are 100 percentÂ remote. Making this adjustment has been quite the learning experience, to say the least. IfÂ your company is in the process of transitioning to being fully remote as well, here are a handful of challenges we faced and how we've worked through them: Our Chico office was one of the most difficult to transition because this is where all our fit stylists work. The challenge here was that these teammates all use multiple monitors and have specific setups in order to do their jobs efficiently -- toggling between different platforms and systems. We had to make sure everyone was able to bring a monitor home with them, and have the equipment they needed in order to still be successful. I've witnessed this same problem with other companies where many people work on a desktop at the office and might not have a personal computer with similar specs to use at home. Or they need to gain an additional license to certain software tools in order to work remotely. Our San FranciscoÂ and Argentina teams were in a similar position -- we gave everyone the option of taking a monitor home with them. Being comfortable in our new ""home offices"" is hugely important to our teams' health, happiness, and productivity. These are all small details that cannot be overlooked. One of the things we've implemented with our fully remote teams is that every team leader does a daily standup meeting with their team. The purpose of starting every day with an 8:30 or 9 a.m.Â video chat is to replicate the feeling of showing up to an office. You walk in, you say, ""Hey, good morning"" to your fellow colleagues, make small talk, and then you get to work. As simple of a routine as this might be, if you take it away, a lot of people have this sense of not really knowing when their day starts and also feel less connected to the people they work most closely with. These check-ins also help keep teams on track -- to their daily and weekly goals, and flag any issues or questions that might have taken place by swinging by a desk in the office. This has been a crucial practice to our success in going remote -- and we do the same thing at the end of the day, around 5 p.m., signaling to people that the day is done. As amazing as Slack is as a tool, or the fact that we can videoconference with people all over the world via Google Hangouts, the truth is, these tools aren't the same as face-to-face interaction. That's why we ask everyone to join and show themselves on their screen. It's not as good as face-to-face, but it is better than just hearing a voice. Communication is different over text or video. When you Slack someone and they don't respond, then what? Or, if you're on a video call with 10Â other people, someone's microphone might keep cutting out. Or two people might keep talking over each other because of latency. These might seem like small, almost insignificant obstacles, but compound them across dozens, or hundreds, or for some companies, thousands of employees, and they become big functionality problems within the organization. The best solution is to just be patient and compassionate with people in the process. Realize this is an adjustment for everyone. Help people learn how to use these new tools. Empower your leaders to talk to people about how they might be feeling suddenly working full time from home. Use these ideas to make your companyÂ and your team stronger. We are all navigating this new world together.",0,
346,Tenerife coronavirus horror: Terrified guest reveals devastating details from inside hotel | World | News | Express.co.uk,Grace MacRae," On the latest episode of BBC Newsnight host Kirsty Wark caught up with terrified British mum Selina Lund, who is currently quarantined in a Tenerife hotel. During Selenaâ€™s video call from her hotel room, viewers learnt of the horrifying conditions British holidaymakers are faced with amid the terrifying outbreak. The Costa Adeje Palace Hotel was put into lockdown after a visiting Italian doctor tested positive for the virus. Guests could be kept in quarantine for up to two weeks. Mum of two Selina Lund was holidaying with her husband and two children when the hotel she was staying at was struck by the virus. When asked what had been happening at the hotel over the past 24 hours, the host said: â€œNot a lot really, weâ€™re not told anything.   â€œThis lunch time we went to reception because our keys werenâ€™t working because we should have checked out yesterday, and it stopped working so we went there and they told us to go for lunch today down to the dining room. â€œSo we walked for the first time through the hotel to the dining room but we were horrified so we came back again.â€ When asked why she was horrified, the mum of two added: â€œThere was just so many people there. â€œWe went first at one oâ€™clock when they told us to and there were just hundreds and hundreds of people queuing up to go and get some food, and it was just claustrophobic and I really felt uncomfortable about it especially when weâ€™d only been there that one night on Monday.â€ JUST IN:Prince George and Princess Charlotte school in coronavirus scare   The host then quizzed the British guest about the use of masks, which seems to only be enforced on the security surrounding the hotel, and not the hundreds of guests staying on the premises. Kirsty said: â€œI understand some people are not wearing masks in the hotel but others are, is there no guidance on that?â€ To which Selina responded: â€œExactly that! And thatâ€™s what absolutely horrified us, we went down an hour later, when we were queuing most people had masks on, there were some without, but most did. â€œWhen we went into the restaurant an hour later once it had calmed down, we went to go get a plate and the first person we could se was an elderly lady, sheâ€™d got a gash on her arm and a mask that was coming off her face and she coughed and I just said to my husband, â€˜we need to get out of here, I cannot eat in here.â€™â€   The mum of two went on to reveal her 12-year-old daughter was â€œso upsetâ€ by the incident and was â€œhorrifiedâ€ to see an elderly lady coughing without a mask on. The hotel was put into lockdown after a man, understood to be a doctor, had travelled to the Spanish holiday island from the Lombardy region - the centre of the outbreak in Italy. He was tested for coronavirus, formally named COVID-19, after falling ill while staying at the Tenerife hotel. The entire hotel, which is currently hosting approximately 1,000 guests, has been quarantined as a precautionary measure.  Police are guarding the outside of the hotel and warning of no access without authorisation on the gates. The hotel has said it has implemented ""all the sanitary and operational measures recommended"" to ""ensure the safety of its customers and employees"". Through a statement, the hotel chain says it is ""working closely"" with health authorities. It says it is giving the clients and hotel staff all the necessary attention and care so that, regardless of the possible inconvenience that this situation may cause them, they are cared for at all times.  Hundreds of tourists staying at the hotel are now being tested for the deadly virus. One British guest staying at the hotel told Sky News on Wednesday: ""All we have been told is to stay in our rooms."" Another Briton, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""We've not been given any information other than a piece of paper under the door. We can't get through to reception.""

138,The New Meaning of Genocide,"Stephen Karganovic
","It is a paraphrase, of course, of the inimitable Dame Rebecca West, advanced with unshakable confidence that she would have heartily approved if she were alive today.

The Corona virus put-on job has now been exposed for the brazen social engineering scheme, potential vaccination rip-off (and here), and ideologically driven mass population reduction project that it had always been, from the start.

We now have all the basic facts we require to deconstruct the mendacious, hysteria inducing narrative that was concocted to bludgeon the imprisoned world into submissive acquiescence to its self-destruction.

The key fact that the Covid-19 virus is a laboratory product and therefore man-made was authoritatively established by French Prof. Luc Montagnier who recently disclosed the results of his laboratory analysis of the virus genome. He found it to be laced with spliced-in HIV sequences, which effectively excludes the possibility of its being the product of a natural process. (Prof. Montaigner put it extremely delicately: “in fact, part of the virus, not the whole, has been manipulated”.) Was it manipulated by bats in some Chinese caves? Prof. Montaigner, incidentally, is eminently qualified to speak on the subject as he was in 2008 a recipient of the Nobel Prize in medicine for identifying the HIV virus. The fact that as soon as he let the cat out of the bag he became subjected to harsh denunciation (here and here) by all the right circles lends powerful support to the credibility of his findings.

Essentially the same conclusions were reached even earlier, in February, by a group of Indian scientists and published in a paper entitled “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HI,V-1 gp120 and Gag”. Reassuringly, under ferocious pressure and ridicule by fake news commissars (and here), the scientists were compelled to withdraw their bold paper, because it appeared to have crossed the line of permissible Corona virus discourse even before Prof. Montaigner came out with his assertions. All the more reason to pay serious attention to the glaringly obvious and undeniably significant implications of these fully congruent findings.

Underlining the fact that we have been plunged, without consent and mostly without awareness, into a post-truth world, facts have largely been supplanted by narratives. And narratives are essentially politically convenient fairy tales that nobody sincerely believes but practically everyone must publicly adhere to in order to hold on to what little reputation and dwindling benefits they’ve got left. Team player adherence to public lies (sorry, fairy tales) is a test of good global citizenship. It is a test that to their moral credit the French professor and the Indian researchers have obviously and perhaps to their lasting professional detriment – failed.

Fortunately, the ranks of non-team players in the Corona virus controversy, with all the lurking personal perils that poses, have actually been growing, rather than shrinking.

We are indebted to Dr. Shiva Ayadurai, a brave Indian-American scientist, for making us aware that immunological deficiency is the principal condition propitiating the spread of the Corona virus and that mass lockdowns, causing sun and vitamin deprivation, as well as depression and other debilitating psychological conditions, has the effect of increasing instead of reducing the immunological vulnerability of the human organism.

Another scientist with impeccable credentials, Dr Rashid Buttar, has argued compellingly that the prevalent Corona virus narrative does not add up. Predictably, this non-team player has also been subjected to brutal media assaults and his public statements have provoked the fury of the political correctness commissariat. In Dr Buttar’s view, anyone who is supporting the use of vaccination to combat COVID-19 is either ignorant or has some hidden agenda or is fiAnonymouscially motivated. The basic fundamentals of how the human body works are, he argues, ignored and in the process, and while ostensibly treating patients infected by the virus, basic neurological, physical, virological and medical principles are being violated or simply put aside. Not without reason, Dr Buttar points out that people with expert knowledge are silent either because of social pressures or fear of losing their license.

The concerted effort to blot out every opinion, no matter how qualified, which does not conform to the narrative, on the specious pretext that it “violates YouTube’s terms of service” or the mysteriously undefined “community guidelines,” is undoubtedly the most persuasive indication of the narrative’s extreme fragility. While some competent critiques still manage to squeak through the “bodyguard of lies” (here, here, and here), all the algorithms have been activated to keep non-conforming, question and doubt-provoking opinions off the table and out of the purview of the immature and irresponsible masses.

So to return to the paraphrase of Dame Rebecca West, what is going on? What is the meta-script (as Israel Shamir has coyly put it) behind this impressive global production? The dark intimations that in “elite” circles there may be an intense interest in reducing the excessive number of useless eaters to a smaller and more docile cohort of helot-like servants are not without empirical basis. Why the fanatical insistence on mass vaccination on a global scale, for our own good of course, although the concept would not even pass the scrutiny of an alert high school biology student, who is well aware that vaccination does not work for prospective or mutated new viruses? Or are we all expected now to fall prey precisely to Covid-19 and be vaccinated willy-nilly against its ravages? On whose authority are wealthy private individuals with no medical training but close fiAnonymouscial ties to the pharmacological industry announcing public health policy measures and determining the particulars and duration of their application? What arcane foreknowledge enabled them to presciently predict the current pandemic several years ago and then suspiciously again, last year several months in advance of its appearance? May the health and welfare of billions of human beings be safely entrusted to self-proclaimed “philanthropists” whose actions are driven entirely by the profit motive, in its various fiAnonymouscial, ideological, and perhaps even occult forms? Will billions of people succumb to a corporate media induced mass hysteria and allow profit-making unknown substances to be injected into their bodies, in complete disregard of the fact that on previous occasions similar forms of “relief” had wrought devastation and havoc throughout Asia and Africa, and wherever else they had been administered?

Humanity has good reason to fear and tremble, not so much at the dreaded disease as at its potentially terrifying cure, which we are told is in the making (perhaps in the same laboratories where the disease was concocted) and undoubtedly will soon be unveiled.

464,How Barcelona would have lined up with Ronaldo and Messi had Man Utd got their way | Football | Sport | Express.co.uk,Jack Otway,"  Back in 2009, Manchester United knew Cristiano Ronaldo wanted to leave. Real Madrid was the playerâ€™s preferred destination but the Red Devils themselves instead wanted him to join Barcelona. That didnâ€™t happen, robbing fans of the mouthwatering prospect of seeing the Portugal international line up alongside Lionel Messi in the side. Ronaldo cost Real Madrid a massive Â£80million when he left Manchester United for the Bernabeu in 2009, becoming the worldâ€™s most-expensive player in the process. It came somewhat out of the blue - particularly given the public stance on Sir Alex Ferguson. The hard-nosed Scot was livid at Real in December 2008, blasting them for pursuing Ronaldo so publicly and insisting he wouldnâ€™t â€˜sell that mob a virusâ€™. Months later, Ronaldo was gone. United wanted to offload their disgruntled talisman to Barcelona instead but Barca werenâ€™t interested and, in the end, he joined Real. Express Sport will now take a look at how the La Liga titans would have looked had they been able to bring Ronaldo to the Nou Camp and paired him up top with Messi.  Barcelona had Victor Valdes between the sticks in 2009, with the Spain international playing at the peak of his powers. He was particularly impressive in the Champions League final that year, keeping United - and Ronaldo - at bay with some fine early saves. Dani Alves was the right-back, shining after arriving from Sevilla the previous year.

KEY STORY: Man Utd owners the Glazers may sell up faster because of coronavirus crisis  Now this is where things get interesting. Barcelona would likely have had to drop Sergio Busquets in order to accommodate both Messi and Ronaldo in the same side. That would have meant Andres Iniesta and Xavi staying in the side which, letâ€™s face it, is still pretty good. Messi would then have been able to play in the No 10 role behind a striker.

54,"The Media-produced Fear Is What’s Killing Our Country, Not the Coronavirus",Leslie Taha,"The media’s incredibly irresponsible, “shock and awe” reporting on the coronavirus has created a monumental stampede of fear and panic which is a million times more damaging than the virus itself.

Here are two facts that says it all:

Fact #1. Deaths in the U.S. from influenza from 1950 to 2017 ranged from 13.5 to 53.7 per 100,000 (source statista.com).

Fact #2. Deaths in the U.S. (as of this writing) from the coronavirus is 14.9 per 100,000 (source worldmeters.info). Bear in mind that this number includes “probable” deaths as well as confirmed deaths from the coronavirus.

So to sum this up, the per capita deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus is lower than the per capita deaths from the flu in almost every year from 1950 to 2017. The highest number of deaths from the flu per capita was in 1960. Deaths that year was 53.7 per 100,000, well over three times as high as the coronavirus. These are the facts, not crazy media hype. Please check them out for yourself. Incidentally, the per capita death rate from what the hysterical media loves to call a, “global pandemic” is only 2.4 per 100,000. The White House Coronavirus Task Force’s newest model predicts that coronavirus deaths could reach 60,000. It currently stands at 49,000. Even if that [estimate] number [which is manipulated] was to double to 98,000 it would still be much lower than all the per capita flu deaths from 1950 to 1998.

So in light of these facts, why is the media on what appears to be a crusade to spread fear and panic throughout the land? Their non-stop, 24/7 hysterical reporting has produced a tsunami of fear and panic creating a domino effect, – an avalanche of panic that has shut down hundreds of thousands of businesses, severely damaged our economy, closed our schools, closed our places of worship, and put 22 million Americans out of work. I’m not saying that the media is trying to destroy the country, but they certainly are behaving like that is their intention.

The fear mongers say that, “social distancing” (translation, – shutting down the country) is the way to fight the virus. We’ve never shut down our country in the past to fight a virus, even though the deaths rates were far higher that the coronavirus rate is now. We’ve always taken care of the sick, but continued to work. We’ve kept our country alive and vibrant. Viruses, illness, and death are a part of life, but life must go on.

There are other countries that are not shutting down their economies as a way to fight the coronavirus, for example Sweden. They have not closed their economy and they are fairing just as well or better than many of their European counterparts that have put severe restrictions on their people and their economies.

If we used, “social distancing” (shutting down the country) whenever a virus came around in the past, our country as we know it would not exist. We would have been reduced to the level of a very poor third world country long ago, and that will certainly happen if we shut down our country to fight every new virus that shows up in the future (as the fear pundits are already predicting).

Yes, the fear mongers are already saying that the coronavirus will make a return this winter. If it does are we going to respond the same way, – “shelter in place”, hide under the bed, and close down the country? If we continue to do this our country will surely be doomed.",1,
106,Does Microwaving Masks Disinfect Viruses?,Paddy Robertson,"Does microwaving masks deactivate the coronavirus and viruses? With masks in short supply, many people are forced to re-use masks, microwaving masks has gone from a crazy-sounding idea to a critically practical question. Another reason this question is critical: Smart Air tests found that washing N95 masks with soap and water  cut particle capture effectiveness by 21%. Other tests found that even merely dipping in alcohol–no rubbing involved–harmed performance. Smart Air ran ran tests on microwaving masks to get to the bottom of it. To start, let’s break this question down into two simpler questions.
1. Does Microwaving Deactivate Viruses?
First, let’s take a look at whether household microwaves can actually kill viruses (stern scientists out there are shouting “inactivate,” since viruses aren’t technically alive). Researchers in Germany tested whether microwaving syringes and cigarette filters could deactivate the viruses behind hepatitis C and HIV. Why cigarettes and syringes? Because drug addicts often use cigarettes and syringes, and they can get infected through them.
Researchers contaminated cigarette filters and the plastic part of syringes with Hepatitis C or HIV. Then they microwaved them for 3 minutes at different power levels. To be on the safe side, the researchers recommended microwaving at 600 watts for 2 minutes or longer. The good news is that most household microwaves on high can cook at 600 watts. To be on the safe side, the researchers recommended microwaving at 600 watts for 2 minutes or longer. The good news is that most household microwaves on high can cook at 600 watts. 2. OK, But Does Microwaving Masks Harm Performance?
OK, tests showed that microwaving can disinfect viruses from materials, but in the case of masks, we need to know if it harms the performance of the mask. To test this, Smart Air’s chief engineer Paddy took a used 3M N95 mask, and commandeered the microwave in the Smart Air kitchen. One problem with microwaving N95 masks: Paddy had to remove all the nose bar and the metal clips. Obviously this isn’t ideal. After removing the metal bits from the mask, the N95 mask became pretty much unusable. If your mask contains metal parts, then you may well end up having to destroy it before it even gets into the microwave. However, the are some masks that don’t contain any metal parts, especially many of the DIY masks that people are using right now. After about 2 minutes, the microwave started smelling. It’s possible that leaving the microwave on for too long could damage it. However, not wanting to give up, Paddy persevered!
After 3 minutes in the microwave and then waiting for the mask to cool down, Paddy took a Met One GT521, and tested how well the mask was able to capture 0.3 micron particles. This particle size is important to test because it’s typically the most difficult size to capture. Surprisingly, microwaving the mask did not harm the mask’s filtration effectiveness. If anything, microwaving slightly increased particle capture. Tests find that microwaving contaminated objects at 600 watts for 3 minutes deactivates viruses from contaminated objects. However, microwaving masks isn’t recommended if it requires removing metal parts. Microwaving masks may also cause masks to melt or even catch on fire, so it is dangerous!
There may be more effective ways of disinfecting your mask. Read our companion article:",1,
389,Premier Foods sales surge amid demand for store cupboard staples | World news | The Guardian,PA Media,"Mr Kipling producer, Premier Foods, has reported a sales surge as the coronavirus lockdown drives demand for store cupboard items. The food group, which also makes Ambrosia and Bisto, said UK sales rose by about 15.1% in March, with UK sales for the three months to the end of March rising 7.3%. Premier Foods said during â€œthis challenging timeâ€ its manufacturing and distribution were working at â€œmaximum capacityâ€ and demand continued to be high. Each factory worker had been given two additional days of annual leave and a Â£250 cash bonus. The company added: â€œVolumes have started to reduce from the exceptional levels seen in March, although are still expected to continue to be higher than average patterns of demand. â€œThis reflects more meals being eaten at home than usual due to recent measures set out by the government, and hence increased demand for the groupâ€™s product ranges.â€ It comes on the back of surging supermarket sales over the past month, as shoppers have stocked up on essentials. Premier Foods made the announcement as it revealed a major shake-up of its pension schemes, following a year-long strategic review at the business. It said this would involve a merger of its three separate pension schemes and would reduce the cash contributions from the group, as Premier looks to save money. The debt-laden business has come under fire from activist investors in recent years, resulting in a leadership shake-up last year. Premier said it expected to post a trading profit for the year ending 28 March at the â€œtop end of market expectationsâ€ following a strong March period.",0,
204,"The biggest media lies about the coronavirus: Origins, treatments and vaccines",Ethan Huff,"If there is one thing that most everyone can agree on concerning the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it is the fact that there is no shortage of conflicting information out there about the nature of it. And the mainstream media is certainly doing its part to steer the narrative as part of a larger agenda, using plenty of misinformation along the way.

The following are among the most commonly parroted lies about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that aim to distort the facts and deceive you into believing falsehoods about this pandemic:

Media LIE: The virus is not man-made
From the very beginning of this thing, the official narrative was that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) came from a Chinese wet market where bats and other “exotic” animals are sold as meat. But the world later learned that it actually more than likely “escaped” from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The mainstream media and social media platforms went nuts trying to censor this information and even called it  “fake news.” But eventually it became undeniable that bat soup was not responsible for spreading the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) around Wuhan and eventually to the rest of the world – hence why we continue to call it the Wuhan coronavirus rather than just COVID-19.

We have even seen attempts by the media machine at making the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) a racial issue because there are supposedly more “people of color” coming down with it than people with fair skin, which further detracts attention away from the source of this virus. Media LIE: Hydroxychloroquine is extremely dangerous and doesn’t work. The minute that President Donald Trump announced that hydroxychloroquine may be an effective, and very inexpensive, remedy for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the mainstream media immediately began decrying this claim as fake news, even though Anthony Fauci himself praised hydroxychloroquine back in 2013 under Barack Obama as being some type of “miracle cure” for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).

There have even been studies conducted that were designed to intentionally smear the drug as both ineffective and dangerous, though one in particular purposely left out zinc, which appears to be a critical co-factor in supporting the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine – in other words, politics as usual.
Media LIE: Only a vaccine can save us from coronavirus
Many politicians and public health officials are parroting the lie that the only way America can come out of lockdown and go back to “normal” is to get vaccinated with some future vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that does not even yet exist. A vaccine, we are repeatedly told, is the only thing, or perhaps some new “blockbuster” antiviral drug, that can cure the world of this scourge and make everything happy and wonderful once again.

Meanwhile, not a peep is being made about things like intravenous (IV) high-dose vitamin C, which is being successfully used in other countries to stem the tide of infections without the need for new drugs and vaccines. By omission, nutrition is pointless
Speaking of natural approaches to overcoming the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that are being systematically ignored by the mainstream media and most in politics, have you heard anyone mention the importance of nutrition in all of this? We did not think so, and this is intentional.

Regular readers of this site over the years should know by now that the single-most important thing you need to do to stay healthy besides exercising regularly is to feed your body the nutrition it needs to naturally ward off illnesses, including those associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Research compiled by the Lewin Group reveals that nutritional remedies such as calcium, vitamin D, folate, omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, zeaxanthin, and more all play a critical role in fortifying the immune system, which, if properly nourished, should have little problem fending off disease. Oh, and Trump is to blame for all the deaths
And last but certainly not least, there is the Blame Trump tactic. When all else fails, simply tack it all on to the Commander-in-Chief, whose lack of a formulated response, failure to follow Fauci’s recommendations, or whatever other excuse they can come up with is directly responsible for all of the deaths tied to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

It is interesting, to say the least, that this crisis emerged almost immediately following the multiple failed attempts by primarily leftists to oust President Trump from the White House on trumped-up impeachment charges. While some may not agree with Trump’s handling of this pandemic, he did leave it up to the states to formulate their own responses, which makes him anything but the tyrant that Democrats like to portray him as being.

As time goes on, this country is sure to see perpetually more societal fracturing as a result of these ever-present, Trump-hating narratives. At a time when the country should be joining together to resist all of the tyranny that is now coming our way as a result of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), left-right animosity is instead being employed as a desperate, last-ditch attempt to smear Trump in the leadup to the 2020 election.

53,Video: The Well-Known Hazards of Coronavirus Vaccines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Interviewed by Dr. J. Mercola,Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Dr. Joseph Mercola,"Kennedy continues telling the story of how the COVID-19 epidemic may have been generated — by releasing the virus — to ensure that dangerous coronavirus research would continue and receive fresh funding: “When President Trump came in, Obama had an office in the White House for pandemic defense, for pandemic security. They were involved in funding [coronavirus research projects in Wuhan] through Fauci. President Trump ended all funding for that office September 20, 2019. So that was the last paycheck any of those scientists got. “On September 30 [2019], a whole lot of scientists were laid off in Wuhan. October 1 is when the first case of [COVID-19 was reported]. So, it’s suspicious because it looks like there’s a possibility — and I’m speculating here; I want to make that clear — but there’s a possibility that somebody who lost their job in that lab … could have released the virus. “Because, immediately, it created an instantaneous market for people with that particular skillset, which is to study how to make a coronavirus vaccine. So, you could go from unemployed to highly employed almost overnight if you released one of those microorganisms they were creating in that lab. I don’t know if that happened, but that’s something that needs to be [investigated].” Flu Vaccination Increases Risk of Coronavirus Infection

Mikovits has strong beliefs on this issue, as she doesn’t believe COVID-19 is due to SARS-CoV-2 alone but, rather, that the virus may serve to activate latent XMRV retroviral infection. She points out that retroviruses, not coronaviruses, are what cause the characteristic cytokine storm signature observed in COVID-19. Mikovits suspects that in people who do not have retroviral infections, SARS-CoV-2 causes no or only mild symptoms.

Like Mikovits, Kennedy cites a Pentagon study7 published in the January 10, 2020, issue of the Vaccine journal, which found you’re 36% more likely to get coronavirus infection if you got the influenza vaccine in 2017 or 2018. As noted in this study, titled “Influenza Vaccination and Respiratory Virus Interference Among Department of Defense Personnel During the 2017-2018 Influenza Season”:

“Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference. Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness.

“The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction.

“This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined.”

Results were mixed. Interestingly enough, while seasonal influenza vaccination did not raise the risk of all respiratory infections, it was in fact “significantly associated with unspecified coronavirus (meaning it did not specifically mention SARS-CoV-2) and human metapneumovirus” (hMPV).

Those who had received a seasonal flu shot were 36% more likely to contract coronavirus infection and 51% more likely to contract hMPV infection than unvaccinated individuals.8

Looking at the symptoms list for hMPV9 is also telling, as the main symptoms include fever, sore throat and cough. The elderly and immunocompromised are at heightened risk for severe hMPV illness, the symptoms of which include difficulty breathing and pneumonia. All of these symptoms also apply for COVID-19. Again, while this study did not look at SARS-CoV-2 specifically, it did look at coronaviruses, so “It’s a red flag,” Kennedy says, adding:

“That study is not alone. We’ve found — and I’ve posted these on my Instagram — at least 10 other studies that say, ‘If you get the flu vaccine, you’re much more likely to get a non-flu respiratory viral infection.’ The risk goes up, in some of those studies, about 600%. In some other of those studies, less than that — 200%, 300%, 400%.

“But virtually all of these studies show that the flu vaccine actually makes you more susceptible to coronavirus, and there may be reasons for that. It’s been speculated that there may be coronavirus contamination in the flu vaccines … [or] it could be the XMRV.

“You’re getting that paradoxical immune response because you’ve been inadvertently inoculated with the coronavirus when you get the flu vaccine. So, we don’t know, but the observed effect is very well documented …

“In Northern Italy, right before the outbreak of [COVID-19], there was a mass vaccination [using] a very powerful flu vaccine … But it’s anecdotal. There’s no proof of [a correlation].”

Mikovits believes one of the reasons older Italians got hit so hard in northern Italy is because the vaccine given there was grown in dog kidney cells, which she claims are contaminated with coronaviruses.

Can Flu Vaccination Trigger a Positive SARS-CoV-2 Test?

What’s more, Mikovits claims that anyone who has received a flu vaccine is likely to register as positive for SARS-Co-V-2 using a PCR test, for the fact that most flu vaccines in the U.S. are made in chicken cells or dog kidney cells, which her research shows are contaminated with coronaviruses. In our interview, she explained:

“[The vaccines] are grown in animal cells and … have some of the same host viral proteins and lock and keys. As they’re floating through the laboratory where they’re growing large stocks of these cells, aerosolizing them, it contaminates and cross contaminates through the air …

“This is what we found in 2011. The big ‘Oh my God,’ was, we can’t afford to retrofit our laboratories and manufacturing facilities toward biosafety level 3 and 4 to protect the lab workers who are spreading these viruses and getting infected. And now the [retroviruses] are aerosolized … All the cell lines are contaminated …”

Mikovits’ research showed that the contamination occurred during the original creation of the cultured cell lines used to then grow the vaccine in. In other words, the cells in which many vaccines are grown are already infected. That’s how the retroviruses get into the vaccine, and is then spread via injection. She doesn’t believe the contamination of vaccines with retroviruses was an intentional act. But the cover-up certainly is.

“The message of ‘Plague of Corruption’ is that we cannot mix animal and human tissues. Not just coronaviruses, but the infectious retroviruses [are spread this way]. We are injecting lots of animal tissue, fetal tissue, into humans, and we’re creating novel viruses all the time, even within the individual or family,” she says.",1,

They've also pushed to ensure groups without banking relationships get access to the program and SNAP benefits. â€” Hirsch The burger chain's CEO said Monday that Shack Shack is returning the $10 million small business loan it received from the government. The restaurant chain was able to raise about $150 million in an equity offering last week. The SBA loan program was a part of the federal government's $2.2 trillion rescue package to help small and medium sized businesses and their employees during the coronavirus shutdown. Shares of Shake Shack ticked about 1.2% lower in premarket trading on Monday. â€” Fitzgerald Oil prices dropped to their lowest level in more than 20 years on Monday as the coronavirus continues to eat away at demand, and as traders fear that with tanks filling up rapidly, there will soon be nowhere to store crude. The price of the nearest futures contract for West Texas Intermediate, which expires Tuesday, plunged 26% to $13.39 per barrel. The contract for June delivery, which expires on May 19,  fell more than 8% to $22.91 per barrel, while the July contract was roughly 5% lower at $28. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded 3.38% lower at $27.12 per barrel. The front part of the futures 'curve,' or the contract that expires tomorrow, was hit the hardest since it applies to fuel that's set to be delivered while most of the country remains on lockdown due to the pandemic. There's little demand for gasoline from refineries, and storage tanks in the U.S. are nearing their limits. ""A trading squeeze ahead of the futures contract expiry is exacerbated by the dislocation in the fundamentals this time around, contributing to these large price swings,"" Rystad Energy's head of oil markets Bjornar Tonhaugen said to CNBC in an email. â€“ Stevens New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday the state is ""past the high point"" of new cases, noting the infection rate has fallen along with coronavirus-related hospitalizations. The governor said that 507 people died of the virus in New York on Sunday, down from 540 deaths reported on Saturday, which marks the state's lowest daily death toll in over two weeks. Still, 1,300 people were hospitalized on Saturday Cuomo said. At least 13,869 people have died in New York from the virus. Despite optimistic news from the virus's epicenter, deaths from the COVID-19 in the U.S. topped 40,000 on Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins. The deadly virus has infected more than 759,000 Americans. Globally, the coronavirus has infected 2.4 million people and killed more than 165,000 people. â€“ Fitzgerald Stock futures pointed to the declines at the open on Monday, with Dow futures falling more than 500 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were also set to drop at the opening bell. Markets are digesting the latest coronavirus news as well as a 20%  decline in U.S. oil prices. Earnings season continues on Monday as investors await data on how badly the COVID-19 outbreak has dented corporate profits. IBM reports after the bell. Stocks are coming off of their second week of gains in more than two months. U.S. equities got a boost last week when the White House discussed reopening the economy and Gilead Sciences appeared to have an effective coronavirus treatment. â€” Fitzgerald â€” with reporting from CNBC's Lauren Hirsh, Pippa Stevens, Michael Bloom, Gina Francolla, Patti Domm and Leslie Josephs.

Ms Pitcher contacted Barnet Council's Registration and Nationality department yesterday morning after the death of her dad, Bill, the previous Thursday, and was given a number to call to order two copies of his death certificate, priced Â£11 each. Ms Pitcher told Express.co.uk: ""The lady who answered told me 'We can't do anything, we are working from home at the moment so we haven't got access to any printers. ""I said: 'I need his death certificate', and she said: 'We just can't do it until the lockdown is over.'""

Sarah, 53, added: ""My dad died last Thursday and I have had it on my list of things to do but calling to ask for that certificate is probably the worst thing and I kept putting it off.

""It may sound like cutting off my nose to spite my face but I want somebody to call me."" Ms Pitcher's dad, a retired HR professional, had worked in numerous countries including Spain, Germany, Russia and the Gambia.  Both she and her son Joe, 29, announced the sad news of his death on Facebook, and the posts attracted more than 300 tributes. Away from his career, Bill was an actor who had had parts in several films, including One Chance, a biographical comedy about Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts which starred James Corden, Mackenzie Crook and Julie Walters, as well as being a keen karaoke singer with the nickname of Wild Bill. He fell ill earlier this year with another virus which affected his kidneys and also presented itself as a cold. Ms Pitcher said: ""He ended up in hospital - he was admitted and then because of kidney failure he got sepsis.  ""He was in hospital for 12 days and they think he contracted coronavirus when he was in hospital. ""And he came home very weak and he to have a walking frame.  ""So he never really got back to his normal state of health. ""Within a few days he had a cold and then he got a cough.   ""Then I took him back to hospital and the A&E doctor said to me he's better off at home but this virus gets worse in the second week.  ""I took him home and he had to isolate obviously and then I said to him he had to understand if he had difficulty breathing he had to tell me and I would call an ambulance and that's what happened. ""He did initially respond quite well to oxygen on a mask, which many of them do. ""But then he declined quite sharply. He sent me a text saying 'I don't think I'm going to make it', which was awful.   ""He could not really speak well enough to have a conversation for long and I called the ward and they said he was very poorly they could see an ending for him soon.""  He died on April 9, having elected not to be put on a ventilator. ""I don't think he would have been able to take the intubation. ""It all went as well as it could have from there.""  However, after publication a Barnet Council spokesman told Express.co.uk a mistake had been made. He said: â€œWe are sorry that Sarah Pitcher was given incorrect information at this difficult time. We will be contacting her individually to apologise.

431,Martin Lewis reveals many more parents could now get Child Benefit - are you eligible? | Personal Finance | Finance | Express.co.uk,Jess Sheldon," The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is having a devastating impact, affecting millions in terms of health, and sadly seeing many lose loved ones to the virus. The crisis is hitting people financially too, with millions of people seeing drops in income during the unprecedented times. This week, Martin Lewis shared some of his money tips during his ITV show. Broadcasting from his office in his home, Mr Lewis shared some ""news you can use"" with viewers. Among his tips was the suggestion that some parents may now be able to claim Child Benefit, while they may previously not have been eligible to do so. This is because they would have been affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) in the past. However, those who have seen their income drop in recent times, could mean that they're taken below the threshold to pay some or all of the tax.  READ MORE: Martin Lewis reveals investing trick  Mr Lewis said: ""If you're a parent and your income's dropped, and you weren't eligible for Child Benefit, check if you are now. ""If there's an individual earner in the household earning over Â£60,000, you don't get it. ""Between Â£50,000 and Â£60,000, and you don't get all of it. ""So let's say the highest earner in your household earns Â£60,000 but they've been put on furlough or they've had a big income drop - which is happening to many people - and that, over the year, on average, will drop you into eligibility for Child Benefit."" Addressing those who may now be eligible, he continued: ""Go and claim Child Benefit now. Claim your Child Benefit, you'll be paid it."" Some people may be concerned that their income will return to its former amount however, in the future. Mr Lewis explained: ""If you later on earn too much, you'll just pay it back through the tax system. ""But, many people are now eligible for Child Benefit who weren't before.""  Child Benefit can be claimed if a person is responsible for bringing up a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training. The payment is paid every four weeks, and there's no limit as to how many children a person can claim for. That said, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. If an individual or their partner earns more than Â£50,000, then they will have to pay back some of the Child Benefit in tax, and this is due to the HICBC. There are two different Child Benefit rates, and the rate depends on who the allowance is for. In the 2020 to 2021 tax year, the weekly rate is Â£21.05 for an eldest or only child. Meanwhile, the rate is Â£13.95 per child for any additonal children. The payment is usually paid every four weeks, on a Monday or Tuesday.

185,LISTENING TO THE CORONAVIRUS ‘EXPERTS’ HAS LED TO DEATH AND DESPAIR,Adan Salazar,"On April 21st the Washington Post savaged Georgia governor Brian Kemp’s decision to begin opening his state after locking down for weeks. “Georgia leads the race to become America’s No. 1 Death Destination,” sneered the headline.

The author, liberal pundit Dana Milbank, actually found the possibility of Georgians dying to be hilarious, suggesting that, “as a promotion, Georgia could offer ventilators to the first 100 hotel guests to register.”

Milbank, who is obviously still getting paid while millions are out of work, sees his job as pushing the mainstream narrative that we must remain in fear and never question what “experts” like Dr. Fauci tell us. Well it’s been three weeks since Milbank’s attack on Georgia and its governor, predicting widespread death which he found humorous. His predictions are about as worthless as his character. Not only has Georgia not seen “coronavirus…burn through Georgia like nothing has since William Tecumseh Sherman,” as Milbank laughed, but Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have seen a steep decline since the governor began opening the state.

Maybe getting out in the fresh air and sunshine should not have been prohibited in the first place!

In fact, as we now have much more data, it is becoming increasingly clear that the US states and the countries that locked down the tightest also suffered the highest death rates. Ultra locked-down Italy suffered 495 Covid deaths per million while relatively non-locked down South Korea suffered only five deaths per million. The same is true in the US, where non lockdown states like South Dakota were relatively untouched by the virus while authoritarian-led Michigan, New York, and California have been hardest hit.

In those hardest hit states, we are now seeing that most of the deaths occurred in senior care facilities – after the governors ordered patients sick with Covid to leave the hospitals and return to their facilities. There, they infected their fellow residents who were most likely to have the multiple co-morbidities and advanced age that turned the virus into a death sentence. Will these governors be made to answer for this callous disregard for life?

Yesterday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar admitted the obvious: “We are seeing that in places that are opening, we’re not seeing this spike in cases.” So why not open everything? Because these petty tyrants cannot stand the idea of losing the ability to push people around.

Shutting down the entire United States over a virus that looks to be less deadly than an average flu virus – particularly among those under 80 who are not already sick – has resulted in mass unemployment and economic destruction. More Americans may die from the wrong-headed efforts to fight the virus than from the virus itself.

Americans should pause and reflect on the lies they are being sold. Masks are just a form of psychological manipulation. Many reputable physicians and scientists have said they are worthless and potentially harmful. Lockdowns are meant to condition people to obey without question. A nation of people who just do what they are told by the “experts” without question is a nation ripe for a descent into total tyranny. This is no empty warning – it’s backed up by history. Time to stand up to all the petty tyrants from our hometowns to Washington DC. It is time to reclaim our freedom.",1,

193,Fauci says coronavirus was not created in Wuhan lab he’s been funding with taxpayer money since 2015 to work on coronavirus “gain-of-function” research,Ethan Huff,"The longer Dr. Anthony Fauci serves as the face of the Trump administration’s coronavirus response, the more we learn about just how controversial and inept he really is.

The long-serving director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in an interview with National Geographic published on Monday that it’s just not likely the coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in a lab in Wuhan city.

“If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what’s out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated,” Fauci said. “Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species.”

Is that so? Because those comments contradict other Trump administration officials including the president himself and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the latter of whom told ABC News’ “This Week” that there is “enormous evidence” the Wuhan coronavirus came from a lab, not a Chinese wet market.

“China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,” he explained to host Martha Raddatz. “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”

So — why would Fauci make such a claim when the real evidence indicates he’s wrong?


Perhaps because he wants to cover up some prior activity that would give him at least some culpability in the creation of the virus? 

As Newsweek reported last month, Fauci supported the laboratory now in question with millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars “for risky coronavirus research.”

The Obama administration banned all federal funding of all efforts to weaponize three viruses
The magazine reported: 

But just last year, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the organization led by Dr. Fauci, funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses.

With the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health pledged $3.7 million over six years to fund gain-of-function work — a pledge that followed a previous $3.7 million 5-year investment in a “project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses which ended in 2019,” the magazine reported.

Several scientists have not been supportive of gain-of-function research because it involves the manipulation of viruses in order to explore how they could infect humans because of the risk of starting a pandemic if one were to be accidentally released. Starting to sound familiar?

And about that 2015 funding. The Times of Israel reported April 25: 

Back in October 2014, the US government had placed a federal moratorium on gain-of-function (GOF) research—altering natural pathogens to make them more deadly and infectious–as a result of rising fears about a possible pandemic caused by accidental or deliberate release of these genetically engineered monster germs.

This was in part due to lab accidents at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in July 2014 that raised questions about biosafety at US high-containment labs. Due to those accidents, the CDC closed two labs and halted some biological shipments. The agency later noted in an internal report that scientists failed to follow proper procedures to make sure samples were inactivated before leaving the lab. There were “multiple other problems” as well.

So, in October 2014, the Obama administration banned all federal funding of all efforts to weaponize three viruses — influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 

But that didn’t stop Fauci, the Times of Israel reported. He “outsourced in 2015 the GOF research to China’s Wuhan lab and licensed the lab to continue receiving federal funding,” the site noted. And to be clear, yes — this is the same lab that is now at the center of the COVID-19 controversy.

No wonder Fauci wants us to believe there’s no connection to coronavirus and the lab he has worked diligently to fund with our tax money.",1,
531,"U.S. gives $5 million to Palestinians amid pandemic, after years of aid cuts - Reuters",,"RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - The United States is giving $5 million to the Palestinians to help them fight the coronavirus epidemic, a U.S. envoy said on Thursday. The donation announced by U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman follows years of aid cuts by President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. â€œIâ€™m very pleased the USA is providing $5M for Palestinian hospitals and households to meet immediate, life-saving needs in combating COVID-19,â€ Friedman wrote on Twitter. â€œThe USA, as the worldâ€™s top humanitarian aid donor, is committed to assisting the Palestinian people,â€ he added. The $5 million will be international disaster assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the State Departmentâ€™s website. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians. The Trump administration since 2018 has cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians. The cuts have largely been seen as a bid to pressure them back to the negotiating table in peace talks with Israel. The Palestinians have boycotted Trumpâ€™s peace efforts since 2017, accusing him of pro-Israel bias after he declared Jerusalem Israelâ€™s capital and later moved the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. Trump released his Middle East plan in January. Israel embraced it, while the Palestinians rejected it out of hand, in part because it endorsed Israel keeping its settlements in West Bank territory it captured a 1967 war.

Rousaud was one of six Barca directors to hand in their resignation to president Josep Maria Bartomeu last week.

Neymar left Barca in a record-breaking Â£200m (â‚¬222m) move to PSG in 2017, but after spending just three years in France the Brazilian is keen on securing a return to the Nou Camp.

But when he has been on the field the winger has showcased his talents, and has scored 69 goals and provided 39 assists while playing for the French club. However, given the financial impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on most football clubs, including Barcelona, Rousand suggested the Brazilian might have to lower his wages demands to secure a return to Spain.

77,FACEBOOK/AP CLAIM CHICAGO MAYOR PLEDGING SUPPORT FOR ‘NEW WORLD ORDER’ IS FAKE NEWS,Paul Joseph Watson,"Facebook and Associated Press ‘fact checkers’ claim it’s false that Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she supported the “New World Order,” saying the video is “edited,” despite the fact that it’s not edited.

A 2019 interview with Lightfoot has resurfaced in which she makes the following statement;

“And you get the people who run those agencies and the deputies that are pledging allegiance to the new world order and good goverAnonymousce.”

Facebook slapped a “false news” label on the post, which serves to bury the content in the algorithm, ensuring it’s reach is restricted. The Associated Press, which is used by Facebook as a fact checker, claims the story is “false” and that the video is “edited,” despite the fact that the video is not edited, it is merely a segment from a larger interview.

By using the term “edited,” the AP is suggesting the video is manipulated or doctored, which it isn’t. Since all video is clipped or shortened, you could claim that all video is “edited.”

AP claims the video is taken out of context because “Lightfoot was not planning a global coup, she was talking about ending a long-standing and unusual custom in Chicago called “aldermanic prerogative,” which gave aldermen absolute power on zoning and development decisions in their home wards.”

However, nowhere is it shown that anyone suggested Lightfoot was planning a “global coup.” This seems to be a strawman invented by the AP itself.

The term “new world order” is clearly loaded and is recognized by most people as relating to global goverAnonymousce and political elitism.

At best, fact checkers could claim some people are taking Lightfoot’s comments out of context, but to declare the video “edited” is clearly not true and serves as a short cut to have it censored by social media companies.",1,

A 6.1% fall for Boeing Co (BA.N) sent the blue-chip Dow .DJI down 0.6%, as its European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) said it was examining requests to defer deliveries after a collapse in travel demand. The Nasdaq .IXIC outperformed the broader market with Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) surging to record highs as sweeping stay-at-home orders drove demand for online streaming services and home delivery of goods. Meanwhile, the shutdown in New York was extended until May 15 even as coronavirus-related hospitalizations and deaths fell to their lowest in more than a week, adding to evidence that the hardest-hit state was controlling its spread. Wall Street has swung this week between hopes of a peaking in coronavirus cases and fears of the biggest economic slump since the Great Depression, as the lockdown measures crushed business activity. Latest data showed jobless claims fell slightly to 5.2 million last week from an upwardly revised 6.62 million the week before, but the total figure for the past month still topped a stunning 20 million. Economists polled by Reuters had estimated 5.1 million jobless claims for the week ended April 11. Wall Streetâ€™s fear gauge  rose for the second straight session, while the flight from risk pressured U.S. Treasury yields. â€œWe are still struggling to grab a foothold on the deterioration of whatâ€™s going on,â€ said Andrew Smith, chief investment officer at Delos Capital Advisors in Dallas. â€œThe jobless claims number is better than what economists expected, but itâ€™s still a little too soon to be extrapolating to the â€˜all clear aheadâ€™ road.â€ After a 27.5% rally from its March lows, the S&P 500 index is still 17.5% below its record high as first-quarter earnings kicked off with U.S. banks preparing for a wave of future loan defaults following a halt in business activity. Analysts estimate earnings for S&P 500 companies slumped 12.8% in the first quarter, with U.S. economic growth expected to have contracted at its fastest pace since World War Two.

172,PANIC WILL END BUT TYRANNY WILL NOT,Gary D. Barnett,"Any real state of fear will bring panic, and once panic is the prevailing attitude of society at large, the herd seeks safety at all cost. Seeking safety under these circumstances allows for tyranny by the ruling class, and when the restrictive consequences of that tyranny are in place, escape from mass servitude is almost impossible to achieve. It must be understood that decisions made under stress due to fear end with a loss of freedom, and when freedom is compromised, what is left is slavery.

We have been told that a pandemic is upon us, and that we must sacrifice for the good of all, and for the sake of the nation. If the people at large accept this premise, individual sovereignty is not only compromised, but also permanently damaged. When the masses as a group seek shelter from harm, and agree to temporarily relinquish some or all of their freedoms, oppression is the result. That is why panic is so perilous, and why hasty decisions should never be made during a real or supposed crisis.

As I write this, it is obvious that none of these suggestions have been followed, and the herd has acquiesced to most all commands from on high in order to gain what will most likely turn out to be false hope at the expense of accepted domination. At this point, it is not too late to reverse part of the damage, but any continuation of mass subservience will only end in oppressive misery.

There is no certainty that this new coronavirus called COVID-19 is any more dangerous than any other virus in the past, but the ruling class and their minions in the mainstream media and beyond, are screaming at the top of their lungs that this is the scourge of mankind, and that tens of millions of Americans will become infected, and that millions might die. This is being promulgated by government at every level, by so-called national and world health organizations, and by a complicit media that seemingly does as it is told by those holding political power. This is being done regardless of the fact that no one knows much about this so-called virus, knows little or nothing about its true origin, and knows little about its mutations. Also, politicians, claimed authorities, and alleged experts are in the dark as to how particular cultures have been more susceptible than others, and are unwilling to discuss that the probable cause of this is due to a man-made strain created in a bio-weapons lab, even though a preponderance of evidence points in that direction. All possibilities should be discussed. This government is now taking total control over our lives, and will take full advantage of this situation to bring draconian anti-liberty measures to all that live in this country.  This is an atrocity, and one that will change the face of this nation. Current risk includes the implementing of medical martial law as well as the possibility of total martial law with any major resistance from those not willing to accept being in a captured society. I outlined the measures that have been implemented by at least 40 states to affect medical martial law recently in this article. The act that has been adopted is the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA), and the included language is dictatorial in nature.

Besides the sheer tyranny of these measures being planned and implemented as I write this, the certain economic devastation to come is unimaginable. No one will be spared economic harm, and many will be completely destroyed by the government’s response to this manufactured panic. In addition, when the virus scare is over, and it will be, the economic destruction will remain, and it could take years for any recovery to take place.

Has all this panic been planned? The impending economic collapse caused by the Federal Reserve and its massive money printing is most likely going to be falsely blamed on the coronavirus, so what is the connection? Was this virus created for the purpose of covering up responsibility for an economic meltdown? Was it created to harm the economy of China and Iran? If not, is it being purposely used for these purposes? Is population control due to all these factors mentioned sought by the ruling class, and is this virus the impetus for gaining that control?

What is next on the agenda due to this panic? Will there be total lockdowns? Will there be universal travel restrictions, even at the local level? Will there be forced vaccinations? Will there be mandatory testing and inspections? Will there be food shortages? Will this lead to concentration camps for dissenters? Will the National Guard and military be patrolling the streets of your town?

There are many uAnonymousswered questions, and much uncertainty about this virus, so what is the real danger? The real danger to America is the U.S. government and its dictatorial response to what appears to be an orchestrated hysteria. The solutions offered by Trump and this government, regardless of who is pulling the strings of these puppets, are far more dangerous than any manufactured pandemic. Fear and panic allow for control, and those in power understand this truth, and use it to their advantage. Panic is worthless, and can only lead to the acceptance of authoritative rule. This is the real risk; this is the real danger. If the people allow a takeover of their lives due to this panic, they will not only have lost their liberty and all they own, they will have also lost their sanity.",1,
462,Virgin Australia set to enter voluntary administration with thousands of jobs at risk | Business | The Guardian,"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-butler,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anne-davies","Virgin Australia is set to go into voluntary administration in the biggest airline collapse in Australia since Ansett failed in 2002, putting thousands of jobs and more than a billion dollars in prepaid tickets at risk. On Monday night sources said the airline, which has been largely grounded since 25 March due to the coronavirus crisis, will appoint John Greig, Vaughan Strawbridge and Richard Hughes of big four accounting firm Deloitte as administrators. The move comes after the federal government rebuffed its plea for a $1.4bn loan as part of a wider bailout of the industry and despite duelling offers of support from New South Wales and Queensland. An announcement is expected as early as Tuesday morning. Virgin Australia employs 10,000 people whose employment is now in jeopardy. Also to be decided is the fate of its fleet of about 130 planes, many of which are mortgaged to the hilt, and almost $1.2bn in customer ticket bookings. The move also sparked fears of sky-high air fares for consumers if bigger rival Qantas is once again able to establish dominance of the Australian market. Administration is likely to wipe out the value of stock in the group, including that held by dominant shareholders Singapore Airlines, Chinese groups Nanshan and HNA, the government of Abu Dhabi through state airline Etihad and billionaire Richard Branson. However, administration may also help a buyer to reduce or eliminate a debt mountain of more than $4.8bn owed to banks that has crippled the airline as it continued to burn through cash while its planes were grounded. It may also be able to close parts of the airline that are not performing well, such as budget arm Tiger. This would allow Virgin Australia to eventually fly again, even if in a reduced form. It is understood that chief executive Paul Scurrah is likely keep his job for the time being. Over the past fortnight Scurrah has been fighting against what he sees as a campaign against Virgin Australia by Qantas, as well as dealing with a government that repeatedly said it was committed to keeping two airlines in Australia but has so far been unwilling to bail out the company. The government has offered the industry about $700m in reduced fees and charges, but these are only of value if planes are flying. It has also offered $165m to underwrite Virgin Australia and Qantas operating a â€œminimum domestic network servicing the most critical metropolitan and regional routesâ€, but because this money only covers the cost of operating the flights it does not improve Virgin Australiaâ€™s financial position. Its collapse raises the prospect of Qantas once again enjoying a monopoly over major Australian air routes, as it did after the collapse of Ansett in 2002. This resulted in fares rising, the former competition tsar Allan Fels told Guardian Australia. The Flight Attendantsâ€™ Association of Australia said it was important that governments gave thought to what they wanted the aviation industry to look like after the coronavirus crisis passed. â€œWe cannot have a complete abandonment of competition. It took 20 years to get Virgin to a position where it was a competitor to Qantas,â€ FAAAâ€™s manager of industrial relations, Steven Reed, said. â€œWe need Virgin in some form, so that people can afford to fly on Qantas,â€ he said. â€œPeople should recall what the airline industry was like when there was no meaningful competition under the two airline policy of the 1970s and early 1980s. â€œUnless the government caps airfares, then the market will set fares and it will be back to $1,000 return to Melbourne, or $3,000 return to Perth [from Sydney].â€ Reed said it was important to keep Virgin trading through administration as Ansett did in the 1990s when it went into administration to ensure that some jobs are preserved. â€œAdministration has great uncertainty, and it doesnâ€™t mean that our people keep their jobs, or that their conditions survive,â€ he warned. He said the union movement was greatly disturbed by the governmentsâ€™ recent regulations which allow enterprise bargaining agreements to be changed at the drop of a hat. Reed also warned that Virginsâ€™s collapse could prove more expensive for government than a bailout. â€œAt the end of the day, the only people paying tax at Virgin are the employees,â€ he said. Virgin has paid no tax for several years as it has failed to run profitably. Virgin Australia has been in the red every year for the past five years, running up losses of more than $1.6bn. It lost an additional $88m in the six months to the end of the year. Transport Workersâ€™ Union national secretary Michael Kaine said administration would be a â€œterrifying moment for thousands of Virgin workersâ€ and repeated his previous calls for the federal government to bail the company out. â€œIt is a viable and much-needed business and without it Australia will struggle to get its economy back on track once the crisis abates,â€ he said. â€œThere is still time for the federal government to work on an investment plan to get through this period of crisis and taxpayers will get a double benefit. The government will retain a competitive aviation market and they will get a return on their equity stake. â€œThe prime minister has promoted the concept of hibernation, of keeping viable businesses afloat through this crisis. That must include Virgin and the only way to do that is a government equity stake in this business.â€ Of the $4.8m the airline owes to its banks, $540m needs to be repaid or refinanced before the end of this calendar year. The company has been considering appointing administrators since at least last Tuesday. As time ran short for the airline, Queensland offered it $200m if it kept its headquarters in Brisbane. Virginâ€™s Bowen Hills headquarters has 1,200 workers and there are 5,000 Virgin employees in Queensland.

385,"Transfer news LIVE: Sancho to Man Utd bid EXCLUSIVE, Chelsea and Liverpool Werner twist | Football | Sport | Express.co.uk",Luke Gardener,"    Liverpool transfer target Timo Werner is said to be taking English lessons with the German international excited about the prospect of a transfer to the Premier League.  The RB Leipzig frontman is the subject of strong interest from the Reds who believe Werner has all the qualities to be part of their attack for next season. Werner has made it clear that he is interested in moving to Anfield, lauding Jurgen Klopp and the current European champions whenever asked about the speculation. â€œYes I know that Liverpool is the best team in the moment in the world and when youâ€™re linked with the team, it makes me very proud,"" he told Viasport in February. â€œIn case of that, itâ€™s a pleasure, but I know that in Liverpool play a lot of good players and I have to improve myself to learn much more things to get on this level to play there.â€ Werner's impressive English came to light during that interview, but now according to Bleacher Report he is looking to sharpen up his grip on the language. The report claims he is having further English lessons ahead of a potential move to England in a bid to help him settle quickly.     Chelsea have made an offer for Napoli and Belgium forward Dries Mertens, according to reports in Italy. The 32-year-old is out of contract in the summer and could move to the Premier League.  Corriere dello Sport claim Chelsea are determined to bring Mertens to Stamford Bridge and beat their rivals to his signature.  The reports claim Manchester United and Arsenal are ready to rival Frank Lampard in the race to sign the Napoli ace.  Inter Milan boss Antonio Conte is also keen on Mertens who is the all-time top scorer for his current Serie A side.  Chelsea are desperate to strengthen their side this summer with Olivier Giroud, Pedro and Willian likely to leave the club.     Manchester United chief Ed Woodward reportedly thinks the club will be in a industry-leading position after the coronavirus crisis - which would allow their summer transfer budget to stretch further.  The Red Devils are expecting a big summer ahead at Old Trafford. And the likes of Jadon Sancho, Jack Grealish and Jude Bellingham are all on the clubâ€™s radar. Manchester United have backed Solskjaer on transfers ever since the Norwegian was appointed as Jose Mourinhoâ€™s successor. This summer, United are primed to go big. They want Sancho, who has been in electric form for Borussia Dortmund scoring 14 goals in the Bundesliga and registering 15 assists along the way. Grealish is another on their radar, having shone at Aston Villa amid a topsy-turvy campaign under Dean Smith. And Bellingham is being courted, too, even if Dortmund appear to be in pole position to land the 16-year-old. Forbes say that Woodward believes that, after the coronavirus crisis, United will be well-placed to secure their top targets.      Chelsea stars Willian, Pedro and Olivier Giroud could all leave the club in the summer but Joe Cole believes Frank Lampard should copy Manchester United and look to keep the trio at the Blues for their experience.  He told The Sun: â€œRightly so, weâ€™ve credited the young players at Chelsea because theyâ€™ve come through, burst onto the scene and been amazing.  â€œBut Giroud, Willian and Pedro are three top class players who have been really massive for the club, particularly Willian, whoâ€™s a club legend, the players and the fans love him.  â€œI hope they can hang onto that experience â€“ if they want to be part of this new, exciting team that theyâ€™re building.  â€œThey can use that experience in the same way that Manchester United hung onto Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville.  â€œIf they can accept that role where theyâ€™re coming in â€“ that they might not play as much as they used to but theyâ€™re helping blood an era which could be as good as any era in the clubâ€™s history - then thereâ€™s a role to play for all of them.  â€œI think theyâ€™re all world class players and it would be tough for any club to replace those three.â€    It goes without saying that Sadio Mane is a huge part of Liverpool's plans moving forward, but pundit Kevin Phillips has claimed the Reds may have already signed him replacement. â€œKlopp has eased him in gently. That is good management,"" Phillips told Football Insider. ""Do not put pressure on the kid straight away and let him get to know the squad. â€œOf course, trying to dislodge one of that front-three is hard but he has had some game time. â€œHe is one of those that Klopp has in place if Sadio Mane was to leave or Firmino. ""Maybe there is a replacement there, but when you have those three at your club you are not getting in front of them. â€œYou have to be patient. He looks like he has qualities. â€œAt times he found it difficult to get into the game when he has come on but he looks like a decent. Given time he will be a good one.â€  JUST IN: Premier League clubs fear hopes of completing season are disappearing after latest meeting     Manchester United are determined to complete a transfer for Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho this summer.  But the England winger will still cost over Â£100million despite the coronavirus crisis.  Thatâ€™s according to University of Liverpool senior teacher and football finance expert Kieran Maguire.  Maguire exclusively told Express Sport: â€œYouâ€™ve got to look at it on a deal by deal basis.  â€œFirst of all Manchester United have a strong balance sheet, they had Â£100m in the bank at the end of December, I appreciate that since then they have signed Bruno Fernandes.  â€œBut even so Manchester United are very successful, theyâ€™ve got great commercial revenue generation so I think they are in a strong position to buy then youâ€™ve got to look at the individual position of the clubs that are selling.  â€œDortmund, I think will be in a relatively strong position to resist offers, or resist the first offer.â€ DONâ€™T MISSChelsea stars to agree pay cut with players under pressure [EXCLUSIVE]Liverpool handed Timo Werner transfer twist as RB Leipzig make decision [GOSSIP]Jack Grealish to Man Utd transfer 'complicated' with two people key [EXCLUSIVE]     Liverpool or Chelsea could be a step closer to signing RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner as the German club are on the verge of signing his replacement, according to reports in Germany.  The Reds have been heavily linked with Werner, who reportedly has a Â£51million release clause in his contract.  The 24-year-old is having another stunning season for Leipzig and so far this campaign he has scored 27 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions.  However, he could now be on the verge of being allowed to leave the club this summer as according to German publication Weser Kurier, Leipzig are close to signing Werder Bremen striker Milot Rashica.  The 23-year-old is also having a great season and has scored 10 goals and provided five assists in 24 appearances in all competitions this campaign.  This goalscoring form is even more impressive given that Werder Bremen currently sit in the relegation zone in the Bundesliga and are eight points from safety.  Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been backed to stay at the Emirates because living in London as a footballer is ""one of the best things ever"", according to Dimitar Berbatov. ""This week there have been lots of rumours surrounding the future of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, it would be a massive blow for Arsenal if he left the club,"" Berbatov wrote in his Betfair column.  ""In my opinion they need to do everything possible to stop him from leaving.  ""I watched him closely at Dortmund and at Arsenal, and for me he is a great player with his speed, his movement and his goals.  ""He is also their captain and a really important player for the team, he is out of contract next year and they should do everything possible to keep him.    ""If he wants to leave, it will be difficult for teams to sign him because Arsenal will want a lot of money for him, and of course he is worth it.  ""In the current situation teams are looking seriously at their budget and I think it will be hard for clubs to afford him.  ""But, I have no doubt that teams will be looking at his situation and taking a lot of interest in it.  ""You have to ask if Aubameyang is happy at Arsenal and, if he isn't, I can understand why.  ""Football is about winning trophies and we all know Arsenal are a team that play attractive football but in the end they have been left empty-handed quite a lot of times. That can be frustrating for a player.â€  See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",0,
243,Scientist Explains Why He Believes Aluminum Is “Almost Certainly” Playing A Role in Autism,Arjun Walia,"Despite the fact that only a small amount of aluminum is contained in aluminum containing vaccines, it’s delivery to the body is different than the aluminum we take in from our food, for example.

When you inject aluminum, it goes into a different compartment of your body. It doesn’t come into that same mechanism of excretion. So, and of course it can’t because that’s the whole idea of aluminum adjuvants, aluminum adjuvants are meant to stick around and allow that antigen to be presented over and over and over again persistently, otherwise you wouldn’t put an adjuvant in in the first place. It can’t be inert, because if it were inert it couldn’t do the things it does. It can’t be excreted because again it couldn’t provide that prolonged exposure of the antigen to your immune system. – Dr. Christopher Shaw –  Canadian neuroscientist and professor of ophthalmology at the University of British Columbia (source)

Many scientists presented facts about vaccines and vaccine safety at the recent Global Health Vaccine Safety summit hosted by the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, and the topic of adjuvants was brought up.

Dr. Martin Howell Friede, Coordinator of Initiative For Vaccine Research at the World Health Organization, brought up the topic of vaccine adjuvants like aluminum, for example. In certain vaccines, without these adjuvants the vaccine simply doesn’t work. Dr. Friede mentioned that there are clinical studies that blame adjuvants for adverse events seen as a result of administering vaccines, and how people in general often blame adverse reactions to vaccines being the result of the vaccine adjuvant. He mentioned aluminum specifically.

He showed concern given the fact that “without adjuvants, we are not going to have the next generation of vaccines.”

He also stated that:

When we add an adjuvant, it’s because it is essential. We do not add adjuvants to vaccines because we want to do so, but when we add them it adds to the complexity. And I give courses every year on ‘how do you develop vaccines’ and ‘how do you make vaccines’ and the first lesson is, while you are making your vaccine, if you can avoid using an adjuvant, please do so. Lesson two is, if you’re going to use an adjuvant, use one that has a history of safety, and lesson three is, if you’re not going to do that, think very carefully.

So, does the aluminum adjuvant in vaccines have a “history of safety?”

According to a study published as far back as 2011 in Current Medical Chemistry 

Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science’s understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. (source)

A year after this,

A study published in BioMed Central (also cited in the study above) in 2013 found more cause for concern:

Intramuscular injection of alum-containing vaccine was associated with the appearance of aluminum deposits in distant organs, such as spleen and brain where they were still detected one year after injection. Both fluorescent materials injected into muscle translocated to draining lymph nodes (DLNs) and thereafter were detected associated with phagocytes in blood and spleen. Particles linearly accumulated in the brain up to the six-month endpoint; they were first found in perivascular CD11b+ cells and then in microglia and other neural cells. DLN ablation dramatically reduced the biodistribution. Cerebral translocation was not observed after direct intravenous injection, but significantly increased in mice with chronically altered blood-brain-barrier. Loss/gain-of-function experiments consistently implicated CCL2 in systemic diffusion of Al-Rho particles captured by monocyte-lineage cells and in their subsequent neurodelivery. Stereotactic particle injection pointed out brain retention as a factor of progressive particle accumulation…

The study went on to conclude that “continuously escalating doses of this poorly biodegradable adjuvant in the population may become insidiously unsafe.”

These authors followed up in and published a study study in 2015 emphasized:

Evidence that aluminum-coated particles phagocytozed in the injected muscle and its draining lymph nodes can disseminate within phagocytes throughout the body and slowly accumulate in the brain further suggests that alum safety should be evaluated in the long term.

I think it’s also important to mention that in 2018, a paper published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry found that almost 100 percent of the intramuscularly injected aluminum in mice as vaccine adjuvants was absorbed into the systemic circulation and traveled to different sites in the body such as the brain, the joints, and the spleen, where it accumulated and was retained for years post-vaccination.

348,IHS: Oil Demand Set For Largest Decline In History | OilPrice.com,Irina Slav,"Crude oil demand during this quarter will likely register the largest decline on record, larger even than the slump that accompanied the 2008 financial crisis, IHS Markit has forecast.  The market research firm unsurprisingly attributed the slump to the decline in economic activity resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, calling the situation in China, where the outbreak started, &ldquo;an unprecedented stoppage&rdquo; of economic activity.  With pretty much every industry suffering the blow of the outbreak, IHS Markit said it expected oil demand to drop by as much as 3.8 million bpd this quarter, to 96 million bpd.  This is bad news for OPEC, which is meeting today and tomorrow in Vienna to discuss additional cuts of 1 million bpd, which would bring their total cuts to 2.7 million bpd. Adding to this the more than 1 million bpd decline in Libyan oil production because of the oil port blockade, and the cartel would, part voluntarily and part forcibly, reduce its production by the same rate as IHS forecasts demand will fall.  This means that oil prices won&rsquo;t change much because OPEC production would be largely in line with global oil demand at the time. This is certainly disheartening as Gulf economies are beginning to feel the pinch of the coronavirus outbreak beyond oil already.  Meanwhile, OPEC appears to be split on how much to cut, further complicating the price situation. Libya is against further cuts calling them illogical, while Saudi Arabia, which needs much higher oil prices to balance its budget, is pushing for cuts of over 1 million bpd on top of the Libyan production outage.  Russia is waiting for the last moment to announce its decision of whether it will take part in this round of cuts or sit it out.  In this situation of uncertainty, one thing seems to be almost certain the fallout of the epidemic that began in Wuhan, China, last December will be severe and extended, affecting all industries across the world.

An announcement confirmed the deal which is for an initial Â£46million, is imminent. The attacking midfielder has been at Carrington all day to undergo his medical and sound out personal terms. Fernandes said his goodbyes to Sporting yesterday, before flying into Manchester. He stayed overnight at the Lowry Hotel and was picked up this morning to head to Unitedâ€™s training complex. The 25-year-old will sign a four-and-a-half-year contract. Fernandes has explained that playing in the Premier League was always his dream and he was therefore likely to snub other options from Spain. JUST IN: Man Utd could complete shock transfer deal for striker because of coronavirus  United have been locked in negotiations with Sporting for several weeks over a potential deal. The Portuguese club sent president Federico Verandas and director Hugo Viana to England for talks two weeks ago. Since then there had been little movement until Tuesday night when United upped their offer.

399,Nova Scotia shooting: gunman evaded Canada police for nearly 12 hours after killing at least 18  - CNN,"Eliott C. McLaughlin, Amir Vera and Paula Newton, CNN","Ottawa (CNN) Nova Scotia investigators are scouring for answers after a deadly rampage that began in the tiny town of Portapique on Cobequid Bay led police on a miles-long chase across the Canadian province. When the manhunt ended about 12 hours later, the gunman had killed 18 people, officials say -- including a police constable and a teacher -- and left a trail of crime scenes that authorities are still working to process. Police block the highway in Enfield on Sunday. Another police officer was injured, police said, and in Shubenacadie, there were reports of gunshots and possibly burned-out police vehicles, according to one of CNN's media partners. The gunman, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, was killed in a shootout with police in Enfield, about 60 miles from the initial crime scene, said Chris Leather, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police chief superintendent and criminal operations officer in Nova Scotia. The motive behind the shooting, one of Canada's deadliest, is still under investigation, Leather said. Some victims, he said, ""appeared not to have a relationship with the assailant shooter."" Read More 23-year veteran of RCMP killed One of those killed was Constable Heidi Stevenson and another officer is hospitalized for injuries he suffered during the incident that are not life-threatening, the RCMP said on Facebook . Constable Heidi Stevenson had two children, police say. ""It is with tremendous sadness that I share with you that we lost Cst. Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the force who was killed this morning,"" said Lee Bergerman, the RCMP's commanding officer in Nova Scotia. ""I met with Heidi's family, and there are no words to describe their pain. Two children have lost their mother and a husband his wife. Parents lost their daughter and countless others lost an incredible friend and colleague."" The chaos began when police were first called to a ""firearms complaint"" at a Portapique property Saturday at 10:30 p.m. ""When police arrived at the scene, the members located several casualties inside and outside of the home,"" Leather said. The gunman may have been wearing a RCMP uniform and driving a car that appeared to be a police vehicle, and authorities highlighted the fact in asking the public to be on the lookout for the look-alike cruiser. ""The fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,"" Leather said. Wortman was not employed by the RCMP, authorities said. 'Oh my God, lock the doors! He's here!' After the initial notice that a gunman was on the loose, police warned residents to stay away from a campground in Glenholme, about 15 miles east of Portapique. Police first asked the public to be on the lookout for the bogus police cruiser in Debert mid-morning Sunday. One of the 18 victims, elementary school educator Lisa McCully, worked at Debert Elementary School, according to the Nova Scotia Teachers' Union, which described her a ""passionate teacher"" and a ""shining love"" in her friends' and family's lives. Wortman was then seen in Central Onslow and farther south in Brookfield, where police updated the suspect's vehicle description to a silver Chevy Tracker. Wortman was involved in a ""serious criminal event"" in Shubenacadie, about 15 miles south of Brookfield, the RCMP's Serious Incident Response Team said. Witnesses recalled hearing multiple gunshots in the area, according to CNN media partner CTV News . Several burned-out vehicles, which may have been police cruisers, sat along the highway, the station reported. ""I hear the shots and ... there's a guy running back and forth up beside what looks to be a police vehicle,"" a witness at the scene told the station. ""Then after a short bit I saw fire."" RCMP told people to stay indoors. The suspect continued south to Milford and was ultimately found at a truck stop in Enfield between 11 a.m. and noon Sunday, about 12 hours after the initial 911 call to police. Truck driver Tom Nurani was at the truck stop when he heard a staff member frantically shouting, he told CTV News. Gabriel Wortman was killed in a shootout, police say. ""'Oh my God, lock the doors! He's here!'"" Nurani recalled the woman saying. ""I peek out of the window, and I saw some RCMP vehicles and there was four or five uniforms with guns."" Witness Glen Hines was driving past when he heard gunfire, he told the station. ""All I could hear was gunshots and my wife. I thought I was going to call 911 because she was going into panic, it scared her so bad,"" Hines said. Politicians respond to shooting rampage Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil called the shooting spree ""one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province's history.""

137,"Bill Gates, Vaccinations, Microchips, And Patent 060606",Leonid Savin,"There are many conspiracy theories – some believe that reptilians are running the US government and others believe that Coca-Cola uses the blood of Christian babies to produce its soft drinks. There are people who have seen “chemtrails” and others who advocate wearing tinfoil hats when watching television to protect from destructive brainwashing waves. Often, the prophecies of Scripture are interpreted as a commentary on some technological discovery or event. But there are also rational facts that it doesn’t make sense to deny because they are documented. These include the existence of the Bilderberg club, the CIA’s MK-Ultra project, and George Soros’ funding of dubious political activities in a number of countries.

The case described below relates to an officially documented fact, although there is something rather biblical about it. Patent WO/2020/060606 was registered on 26 March 2020. The patent application was filed by Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC, headed by Bill Gates, back on 20 June 2019, and, on 22 April 2020, the patent was granted international status. The title of the patent is “Cryptocurrency system using body activity data”.

So, what is this invention that the people at Microsoft decided to patent? The abstract of the patent application online states: “Human body activity associated with a task provided to a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system. A server may provide a task to a device of a user which is communicatively coupled to the server. A sensor communicatively coupled to or comprised in the device of the user may sense body activity of the user. Body activity data may be generated based on the sensed body activity of the user. The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.”

In other words, a chip will be inserted into the body that monitors a person’s daily physical activity in return for cryptocurrency. If conditions are met, then the person receives certain bonuses that can be spent on something.

A detailed description of the “invention” provides 28 concepts for how the device could be used.

It also provides a list of countries for which the invention is intended. Essentially, this is all the members of the United Nations and a few regional organisations specified separately – the European Patent Office, the Eurasian Patent Organization, and two African intellectual property protection organisations.

Although inserting microchips into the body is nothing new – the Masonic Youth Child Identification Program has been in operation in the US for a while, and people calling themselves cyborgs exhibit various implants – Microsoft’s involvement is interesting. And why has the patent been given the code number 060606? Is it a coincidence or the deliberate choice of what is referred to in the Book of Revelation as the number of the beast?

Bill Gates’ name is constantly being mentioned these days in connection with his interests in pharmaceutical companies, vaccinations, and WHO funding. Although the globalist media try to highlight Bill Gates as a great philanthropist and protect him from attacks and criticism in every way possible, it is unlikely they’ll be able to conceal a whole web of connections.

Bill Gates’ company is involved in another project – the digital ID project ID2020 Alliance. On the website’s homepage, it says that the project has been addressing the issue of digital rights since 2016. In 2018, the Alliance worked with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Besides Microsoft, the Alliance includes the Rockefeller Foundation, the design studio IDEO.org (with offices in San Francisco and New York), the consulting firm Accenture, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance – a company that actively promotes and distributes various vaccines around the world. The Secretariat for the Alliance is based in New York.

It is telling that Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance mostly covers countries in Africa and Asia. In Europe, the organisation is only active in Albania, Croatia, Moldova and Ukraine, and, in the Caucasus, in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance also has links with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF. These are all listed as founding partners!",1,

267,Bioweapons Expert Speaks Out About Novel Coronavirus,Dr. Joseph Mercola,"STORY AT-A-GLANCE

Francis Boyle, who for decades has advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, suspects COVID-19 is a weaponized pathogen that escaped from Wuhan City’s Biosafety Level 4 facility, which was specifically set up to research coronaviruses and SARS
According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material and possibly flu virus. It also has gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal
The incubation period for COVID-19 infection is still unknown, but estimates range from 14 days to 30 days
The U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015
While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans, should the situation take a turn for the worse
As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world.

The first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.2,3

On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 -- a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.5

Less than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. -- 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, ""The World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out 'all the stops'""to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China ""appeared to be over the worst""of it, CBS said.

All told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98,067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80,430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.7

COVID-19 -- A Weaponized Coronavirus?

In this interview, Francis Boyle -- whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science -- shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus.

For decades, he's advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.

At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.

As a result of Boyle's antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration -- a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons -- Boyle has carefully followed ""mysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world"" that have appeared since then. ""My biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted.

Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,"" Boyle says.

""So, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me.

There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It's the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus.

There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons.

For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility … maybe mid-November … and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.""",1,
213,UPDATED: BILL GATES EXPLAINS THAT THE COVID VACCINE WILL LIKELY USE EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,Alex Pietrowski,"Rather than instruct people on how to improve their overall health or boost their immunity with healthy foods, quality supplements, and physical activity, the powers-that-be are telling the world that the only way to survive the Coronavirus crisis is to rush the development of a vaccine and then inject every human being on the planet.

The U.S. government along with major cities like Chicago are already moving forward with plans to use government resources and the military to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines to Americans by the end of the year.


At the forefront of this conversation is Bill Gates, who has emerged somehow as the world’s leading expert on pandemics and vaccines. Through his foundation he supports the WHO and the development of new vaccines, and is currently backing a number of pharmaceutical companies as they race to invent the product that will save the world from Covid-19.

Typically, the process of developing, testing and mass producing vaccines takes years, but thanks to newly emerging, experimental technology, Gates hopes to be able to vaccine “7 billion healthy people” in record time.

A new generation of vaccines is emerging as we speak. At present there are no DNA and RNA vaccines approved for human use, but as Gates says in the following post from his personal blog, the time for trying these out on everyone has come. In the following comment he explains the difference between traditional vaccines and DNA/RNA vaccines, which, again, have never been approved for human use:

“Vaccines circumvent this whole process by teaching your body how to defeat a pathogen without ever getting sick. The two most common types—and the ones you’re probably most familiar with—are inactivated and live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain pathogens that have been killed. Live vaccines, on the other hand, are made of living pathogens that have been weakened (or “attenuated”). They’re highly effective but more prone to side effects than their inactivated counterparts.

Inactivated and live vaccines are what we consider “traditional” approaches. There are a number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates of both types, and for good reason: they’re well-established. We know how to test and manufacture them.

The downside is that they’re time-consuming to make. There’s a ton of material in each dose of a vaccine. Most of that material is biological, which means you have to grow it. That takes time, unfortunately.

That’s why I’m particularly excited by two new approaches that some of the candidates are taking: RNA and DNA vaccines. If one of these new approaches pans out, we’ll likely be able to get vaccines out to the whole world much faster. (For the sake of simplicity, I’m only going to explain RNA vaccines. DNA vaccines are similar, just with a different type of genetic material and method of administration.)

Our foundation—both through our own funding and through CEPI—has been supporting the development of an RNA vaccine platform for nearly a decade. We were planning to use it to make vaccines for diseases that affect the poor like malaria, but now it’s looking like one of the most promising options for COVID. The first candidate to start human trials was an RNA vaccine created by a company called Moderna.

Here’s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen’s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them—and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit.

Here’s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen’s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them—and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit.

Because RNA vaccines let your body do most of the work, they don’t require much material. That makes them much faster to manufacture. There’s a catch, though: we don’t know for sure yet if RNA is a viable platform for vaccines. Since COVID would be the first RNA vaccine out of the gate, we have to prove both that the platform itself works and that it creates immunity. It’s a bit like building your computer system and your first piece of software at the same time.” ~ Bill Gates

So, the rushed Covid-19 vaccine will most likely not be a traditional vaccine. It will not be tested for the typical duration that most vaccines are tested for. It will very likely be distributed by the military, and it everyone on the planet will have to take it.

As noted by investigative journalist Jon Rappoport:

“Two new technologies are in the COVID testing pipeline as we speak: DNA and RNA vaccines. They have never been released for public use. DNA technology is actually gene therapy. Genes are injected into the body, and they permanently alter the genetic makeup of the recipient in unknown ways. RNA vaccines would carry the danger of triggering autoimmune reactions, meaning the body basically goes to war against itself.

The vaccine that is being tapped by the US government… under its National Institutes of Health…through drug company Moderna…HAS NEVER BEEN USED ON THE PUBLIC BEFORE. IT IS NOT LICENSED FOR PUBLIC USE.

RNA VACCINES AND THE TECHNOLOGY THEY USE ARE ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL.

AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF VACCINE BEING RUSHED INTO EXISTENCE IN 90 DAYS.

What in the world could possibly go wrong?

One way to find out is to unleash it on millions of people, stand back, and see.” ~Jon Rappoport

275,The upside of lockdown: copycats and crooners lift the spirits | News | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frances-perraudin,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues, with astonishing daily death tolls and unrelentingly grim headlines, some are still managing to find hope in the gloom â€“ from nonagenarians setting themselves physical feats to raise money for the NHS to Elvis impersonators lifting peopleâ€™s spirits. Capt Tom Mooreâ€™s now almost legendary fundraising effort, in which he raised more than Â£26.5m for the NHS by walking 100 laps of his garden, has inspired a string of copycats. Among them is 90-year-old Margaret Payne, who has set out to climb the equivalent of a Highland mountain by taking repeated trips up and down her stairs, and 91-year-old Welsh farmer Rhythwyn Evans, who is pledging to walk 91 laps around the exterior of his bungalow. Ben, 11, from Lincoln has completed the National Three Peaks Challenge by climbing the equivalent of 3,408 metres â€“ the combined height of Ben Nevis, Snowdon and Scafell Pike â€“ in just over 17 hours on his stairs. He has raised more than Â£3,000 by going up and down his stairs 1,704 times, according to the BBC. Six-year-old Hector Dee, from Wetherby in Yorkshire, is walking six miles in six days to raise money for frontline workers, while nine-year-old Amelia Davies from Leeds bounced on her trampoline for a total of 24-hours over the course of a weekend. She only took breaks to use the toilet, eat and sleep. Former Scotland rugby captain Mike Biggar, from Wiltshire, has also set himself a challenge. The 70-year-old, who has used a wheelchair since a car accident in 1992 left him with brain damage, is attempting to walk 100 steps in 30 days, with the help of his bars, to raise money for the NHS. Fifty-nine-year-old Rudo Moyo, who lost his sight to measles at the age of four, is similarly walking 260 laps of his garden in Washington, Tyne and Wear, over 10 days. Appearing on Good Morning Britain with his daughter on Monday morning, Tom Moore described the response to his fundraiser for the NHS as â€œrather like being in fairylandâ€. Hannah Ingram-Moore, said: â€œOur life has changed in the last five days. Every day something extraordinary happens â€¦ We simply remain a happy family and utterly humbled by the support of the public.â€ This weekend saw some of the biggest names in music â€“ from Lady Gaga to the Rolling Stones â€“ perform to millions from their front rooms as part of the The One World: Together at Home concert. But there were also some less known acts attracting huge audiences online. Mark Summers, an Elvis performer, said he was humbled after a live-streamed event on Saturday evening â€“ in which he sang requests from his home in the West Midlands â€“ racked up 75,000 views and raised more than Â£13,000 for the NHS. People tuned in from as far a field as Dubai and Thailand. Summers sang Elvis classics like Suspicious Minds, Donâ€™t Be Cruel and Always on my Mind, and played a specially recorded message of support from Sir Cliff Richard saying: â€œThe NHS is the greatest, Elvis was the greatest, they go really well together.â€ Writing on his Facebook page, Summers said he had received messages from people saying they had felt depressed, lonely, and isolated from family, and that the performance had made them feel better. â€œElvisâ€™s music is so powerful it brings all age groups together, its fun, itâ€™s moving and so much more,â€ he said. Meanwhile beef farmer Andrew Sheldon from Draycott in Somerset has been dubbed the Somerset Crooner after sharing videos of himself singing on Facebook. Each song is dedicated to the NHS and frontline workers, and some recordings have had as many as 50,000 views in two hours. â€œWith all this coronavirus and that going on, thereâ€™s a lot of lonely people out there, sad people, one thing and the other, and I thought Iâ€™d like to lift peopleâ€™s spirits up a bit,â€ he told the BBC. Championship football club West Bromwich Albion have donated their stadium for use as a maternity clinic, so that expectant mothers can avoid hospital visits during the coronavirus crisis. The club has started providing free space in the East Stand suites at The Hawthorns stadium to deliver antenatal and postnatal care. Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust said three clinics would be held Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm, and would be staffed by 10 midwives and three support workers. Helen Hurst, director of midwifery at the trust, said: â€œWe wanted to provide an alternative space for women who are having antenatal and postnatal care. Women are slightly anxious about coming to hospital in the current climate so we wanted to find a safe space away from the hospital.â€ She added: â€œWe are really grateful to the Baggies for providing this space for women during this worrying time.â€ There has been a mixed response to a suggestion by the actor Idris Elba that the world should take a week of quarantine every year to â€œremember this timeâ€ once the pandemic is over. Elba, who starred in Luther and the Wire, told the Associated Press: â€œI think that the world should take a week of quarantine every year just to remember this time. Remember each other. I really do. I think itâ€™s â€¦ other species use it. Itâ€™s called hibernation. But it does remind you that the world doesnâ€™t tick on your time.â€ Responding to the comment, one Twitter user said: â€œThe world should go to war for a week to remember WW2.â€ Elba announced last month that he had tested positive for coronavirus but had no symptoms. He attended the Wembley Arena We Day event on 4 March alongside Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister, who also tested positive for the virus.",0,
289,Sandoz to keep prices stable on coronavirus-relevant drugs,,"ZURICH, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Novartis subsidiary Sandoz on Wednesday said it would keep prices stable on a basket of medicines which may help to treat coronavirus patients, responding to recent concerns over potential drug shortfalls and price spikes in the wake of the coronavirus break. ""With immediate effect, and despite current uncertainties about how the supply situation will evolve, Sandoz is committing as an initial response to keep prices stable for certain essential medicines it markets commercially, which may help in the treatment of coronavirus cases,"" Sandoz head Richard Saynor said in a statement. The price freeze will affect roughly twenty antiviral and antibioitic drugs, a spokesman said. Industry experts have warned of shortages and potential price increases of generic drugs if the coronvirus outbreak disrupts suppliers of pharmaceutical ingredients in China. U.S. officials earlier this week raised concerns about the security of the U.S. drug supply chain in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in China, where a significant portion of the ingredients used to make prescription drugs is manufactured.

59,Police State Powers? Suspension of Constitutional Rights During COVID-19?,Stephen Lendman,"Crises are times when ruling authorities convince people to sacrifice personal freedoms for greater security — not realizing that both will be lost.

Ruling authorities take advantage of times like now by instituting draconian policies they’re unable to introduce during normal times without risking mass rebellion.

Following the state-sponsored 9/11 false flag, police state America emerged.

A war OF terrorism was launched at home and abroad, not on it. Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) was a declaration of forever wars on invented enemies to feed the military, industrial, security, media complex.

Military Order No. 1 let Bush/Cheney capture, kidnap, arrest, indefinitely detain, or eliminate virtually anyone anywhere claimed to be involved in international terrorism — true or false.

Initially the order applied only to non-citizens, later to anyone at home and abroad.

Unconstitutional military commissions were established to conduct secret trials, their rulings not subject to appeal.

Torture became official US policy, Guatanamo the tip of a global network of secret torture prisons that still operate extrajudicially.

National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directives enabled the executive to usurp virtual dictatorial powers on the phony pretext of combatting terrorist groups — created and supported by the US, their fighters used as Pentagon/CIA proxies.

The USA Patriot Act, Homeland Security Act, Military Commissions Act, Detainee Treatment Act, revision of the 1807 Insurrection Act and virtual elimination of 1878 Posse Comitatus Protection, mass surveillance, Protect America Act, compromising Miranda rights, indefinite detentions of individuals uncharged and untried, a secret kill list, and other police state measures became official policy under both right wings of the one-party state.

So is Continuity of Government (COG) coup d’etat authority, violating constitutional separation of powers under alleged catastrophic emergency conditions, defined as:

“(A)ny incident (such as a terrorist attack), regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the US population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions.”

COG is defined as:

“(A) coordinated effort within the Federal Government’s executive branch to ensure that National Essential Functions continue to be performed during a Catastrophic Emergency.”

Renewed annually, COG authority gives presidents and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unprecedented police state powers to declare martial law without congressional approval and rule extrajudicially, free from constitutional constraints.

In September 1982, Ronald Reagan’s National Security Decision Directive/NSDD 55 established a National Program Office (NPO), tasked with ensuring the federal government’s survive in case of a national emergency, specifically a nuclear attack.

In 1988, Reagan’s Executive Order 12656 authorized a COG response, including full-scale militarization in case of a “national security emergency,” defined as:

“(A)ny occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological or other emergency, that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States.”

The policy remains in place to let US ruling authorities act against designated domestic and foreign adversaries, dissent, civil and human rights, and other fundamental freedoms — on the phony pretext of protecting and defending national security at a time when America’s only enemies are invented.

Post-9/11 laws and presidential actions compromised the Constitution’s First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and 14 Amendments.

Speech, press, and academic freedoms were eroded. So were free association, due process, judicial fairness, habeas and Miranda rights.

Will spreading COVID-19 outbreaks and economic duress be used as reasons to suspend the Constitution and institute martial law on the phony pretext of public protection and security.

The Trump regime’s Justice Department secretly asked Congress to pass legislation that permits suspension of constitutional rights during the COVID-19 and other emergencies.

Undefined emergencies would give the White House authority to invent pretexts for hardening police state powers to include whatever actions the executive wishes to order.

Once in place, they’d likely be hard to reverse short of national rebellion.

Power isn’t relinquished voluntarily. Responsible change most always comes bottom up, not top down.

If US ruling authorities usurp unconstitutional powers on the pretext of a COVID-19 emergency and/or threat of economic collapse, martial law may replace remaining fundamental freedoms.

Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely — the slippery slope in the US where things today are perilously heading.

A Final Comment

In August 2017, the Trump regime reversed a ban on providing battlefield military weapons and equipment to police departments nationwide.

The action was and remains an effort to harden control in cities and towns nationwide on the phony pretext of protecting public safety.

It comes at the expense of civil liberties. It gives local police more firepower to protect privileged interests at the expense of constitutional rights and public welfare.",1,
21,Did China Steal Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponize It?,Tyler Durden,"On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke. Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice. This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents. The Canadian Lab. Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus. Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory. NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004. This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage. Chinese Biological Espionage. In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon. Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc. The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML. Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens. But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra). Infiltrating the Canadian Lab. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely: Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun; Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region; Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei; Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses. However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein. The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The Wuhan Coronavirus. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility. Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the HuaAnonymous Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu. Coronavirus Bioweapon. The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia. “Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.” James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized. That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.” China’s Biological Warfare Program. In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production. China's Biological Warfare Program is believed to include full range of traditional chemical & biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles. #coronarovirus https://t.co/7qpDNNmqk7. — GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 25, 2020. China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post. Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination. China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.

The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology. In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development. In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare. Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”",1,

228,Unmasking the Truth: Studies Show Dehumanizing Masks Weaken You and Don’t Protect You,Makia Freeman,"Dehumanizing masks have sadly become a part of the new normal in many states and nations around the world. Many local and state governments are forcing people to wear them, and many businesses are dutifully toeing the official line and refusing entry to customers who don’t wear them. Apart from the obvious truth that widespread mask usage has a deliberately dehumanizing effect (in line with the transhumanist synthetic agenda), many scientific studies show that masks serve no useful medical purpose for healthy people. Masks weaken you by causing hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide) and hypoxia (decreased oxygen). They are designed for surgeons (so they don’t accidentally transmit bodily fluids like saliva into a patient they are operating upon) or for sick people (so they don’t infect others via large respiratory droplets). Scientifically speaking, they don’t stop healthy people from getting infected! Below is the evidence showing this. This will leave you with the inescapable conclusion that these masks are not about protecting health – but rather about control, dehumanization and the destruction of health.

Masks Lead to Under-Oxygenation, a Forerunner to Fatigue, Weakness and Serious Diseases Like Cancer

It is a commonsense scientific fact that wearing a mask blocks your airways and therefore leads to both hypercapnia (an increase in and accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body from breathing in exhaled air) and hypoxia (a lack of oxygen in the tissues). Symptoms of hypercapnia include dizziness, drowsiness, excessive fatigue, headaches, feeling disoriented, flushing of the skin and shortness of breath. Symptoms of hypoxia include anxiety, restlessness, confusion, changes in the color of skin, cough, rapid breathing, shortness of breath and sweating. Not surprisingly, both conditions are similar, since they are both characterized by a lack of oxygen. In addition, hypoxia has been shown to lead to impaired immunity in general, and to be a forerunner to serious diseases such as atherosclerosis, stroke and heart attack. It is also the necessary precondition for the development of cancer (as I covered in my series on natural cancer cures). Dr. Russell Blaylock highlights how wearing a mask is actually putting you at more risk of infection, because you are lowering your overall health, strength and immunity by under-oxygenation: Public Health Agency of Canada Admits “Little Evidence” Masks Protect Healthy People

This document from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) openly admits there is little evidence that, if you are well or healthy, wearing a mask will somehow protect you. This flies in the face of the propaganda going around that “my mask protects you, your mask protects me” since the only point (if you are not someone like a surgeon) is for already sick people to wear them to block the escape of large respiratory droplets. It is standard medical practice that masks are worn by the infected not the uninfected (as in the case when someone has TB), just as it is standard medical practice that quarantine is for the sick or immuno-compromised not the whole infected community. The definition of quarantine is “a state, period, or place of isolation in which people or animals that have arrived from elsewhere or been exposed to infectious or contagious disease are placed” so, ipso facto, the lockdown of an entire society is not quarantine but outright tyranny. Remember, Operation Coronavirus is not about medical common sense or logic; it’s about control. Mandatory mask-wearing orders are just another way in which NWO conspirators are testing how far they can push people and seeing how much they can get away with. Just like the unscientific social distancing rules (1 meter, 1.5 meters, 2 meters, 6 feet or something else depending upon where you live), masks are symbolic of this entire fake pandemic operation. It’s not about reason or logic; it’s about fear and conditioning. They are training you to obey, training you to question whether you are following all the rules for every minute of your existence, training people to snitch on each other, training people to accept isolation and training people to fear each other (just as with the manmade climate change hoax).

Now we can’t even see people’s face when we interact with them! People of the Earth – WAKE UP!

This is mass conditioning. The degree to which healthy people willingly endorse and obey mask-wearing orders is directly proportional to their level of ignorance and fear. No interventions such as masks or vaccines can come close to the importance of living healthfully and developing your inner terrain (and hence your immune system) so that you are less susceptible to disease. It’s time to ‘unmask’ the truth and use this crisis to educate ourselves and others about the true nature of viruses, the immune system, health and disease.",1,
37,Black cats turned into paste and sold as Covid-19 remedy in Vietnam,Anonymous,"Charity No to Dog Meat say the practice is centred in the country’s capital Hanoi, but bottles of the ‘remedy’ are also being sold online. One photo purportedly shows the mixture being fed to a baby.
Graphic footage taken by campaigners shows rows rows of dead cats drying in the sun after being slaughtered. Another video shows a live cat being placed in a cooking pot as boiling water is poured over it.
No to Dog Meat founder Julia de Cadenet said watching the distressing clip made her blood run cold. She realises people worldwide are ‘understandably terrified of COVID-19’ but said this does not excuse the ‘horrific cruelty’ being inflicted on these defenceless animals.The activist added: ‘There is no evidence whatsoever that eating cats cures coronavirus, and even if there was, this inhumane treatment is a level of cruelty that is unacceptable even for those who eat meat.
‘In China when the virus first broke rumours flew around that pets could spread the disease, this led to many people and the authorities rounding up animals and killing them.
‘Our human fears about this pandemic should not be used as an excuse to treat defenceless animals who look to us for protection, with utter contempt.’
The cat-based ‘cure’ is made by grinding up cooked animals into a paste, which is then taken by people suffering from coronavirus or those hoping not to catch it.
Julia has warned both the UK Government and the UN many times that unsanitary meat production, such as the dog and cat meat trade in the Far East and Southeast Asia could cause a global health crisis.
She added: ‘They recognise that live slaughter of animals in markets is particularly unsanitary and that human consumption of wildlife and endangered species must end.",1,

The man was rushed to the hospital, where according to social media reports, he is believed to have died. The man’s cause of death has not yet been determined, but plenty of people suspect that he may have died of the coronavirus. The incident occurred in Flushing Queens, an area of the city filled with Chinese immigrants. According to reports, a man was walking down the street, when he was suddenly overcome with a bought of coughing. He collapsed onto the floor, and after a few seconds, he stopped moving. As the video shows, officers quickly arrived on the scene, but seemed unwilling to physically assist the man, perhaps out of fear. Unfortunately, New York City has been facing a rise in racism against Asian Americans since the outbreak of the coronavirus.",1,
157,"While you’re terrified of Covid-19, some climate alarmists are overjoyed because, for them, fear is… an OPPORTUNITY",Frank Furedi,"Many hardline environmentalists are overjoyed at the atmosphere of fear that Covid-19 has created; for them, it is an instrument for realising the dream of a society that runs according to climate alarmists’ dogma.
“Some believe the pandemic is a once-in-a-generation chance to remake society and build a better future,” argues one advocate of climate alarmism. 

So, in case you thought that Covid-19 is a global pandemic of catastrophic proportions, think again!

In the West, hardline environmentalists are working overtime to portray Covid-19 as payback for all the miseries that humans have inflicted on the planet. They claim that global warming, species extinction, the emergence of superbugs and the eating of meat are somehow directly or indirectly linked to the outbreak of the current pandemic. They regard the fears and anxiety generated by the current public health emergency as an opportunity to promote the message that, unless we accept their dogma, humanity will become extinct. Keeping people in a state of fear of what they euphemistically describe as ‘emergency mode’ is the objective of Klein Salamon. As she stated, “now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate.” 

That’s another way of saying that perpetuating –indeed, institutionalising– a climate of fear is the main objective of this movement. From this perspective Covid-19 is not so much a tragic public health issue but an instrument for realising the dream of a society that runs according to the environmentalist dogma of misanthropic miserabilism.

What green fear entrepreneurs really hate is the spirit of human ambition, that refuses to defer to the dictates of nature. This is a spirit that is open to taking risks in order to transform the world through the use of science and technology. From the time when humans stepped out of their caves to taking the risk of travelling to space, there were always those who decided to do what was necessary to conquer their fears. The refusal not to give in to fears is always the first step towards looking for solutions that will allow us to assume greater control over our lives.

It is precisely this aspiration to take control and harness the power of nature and science that climate alarmists despise. They despise it so much that they have coined the term ‘human impact’ to suggest that what people have done to the planet is by definition wholly destructive. They hate humans’ impact on the world so much that many of them want to dramatically decrease the number of babies that are born. According to the climate alarmist narrative, being scared for your life is the desirable state to be in. As Klein Salamon indicated, “we need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we’re terrified about”! Why? Because collective fears will force governments to act!

Back in the 17th century, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes anticipated the green politics of fear in his classic text, The Leviathan. Hobbes claimed that it is good when people are scared and frightened. Why? Because in their state of fear people will readily subject themselves to an absolutist ruler in exchange for his protection. One does not need a PhD in philosophy to understand that climate alarmist politics leads straight to the doorstep of the Leviathan.",1,
50,COVID-19 a Diabolical Totalitarian Plot?,Stephen Lendman,"Seasonal flu most often getting scant attention is what a real pandemic is all about.

During the 2018-19 flu season in the US alone, running from October to May, there were more than 35.5 million flu illnesses, over 16.5 million medical visits, about 490,600 hospitalizations, and around 34,200 deaths — with no fear-mongering pandemic headlines.

One time long ago I experienced seasonal flu. It drained my energy, killed my appetite, and debilitated me for about three days at home, not hospitalized — after which I felt fine and resumed normal activities.

I needed no potentially toxic drugs to recover. I rested mostly in bed and let the symptoms run their course which they did.

The Mayo Clinic calls COVID-19 a coronavirus strain that can range from asymptomatic to mild to severe, most cases in the first two categories.

People most vulnerable to experience severe symptoms are older with weak immune systems and anyone with chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and issues affecting the respiratory system.

Thailand Medical News (TMN) calls itself a leader in “breaking the latest credible research and developments with regards to the COVID-19 disease,” adding:

“(O)n every issue to date (about the disease), we have been proven correct while it has come to light that establishments like the WHO and the US CDC are the actual perpetrators of fake news and misinformation” that’s harmful to human health.

TMN warned that COVID-19 mutated into “eight distinct…strains…with different clinical manifestations (that are) mutating (further) on average every 15 days.”

Mutations “are fundamentally very similar to each other.” It’s unclear if mutations increase their virulence.

It’s known that COVID-19 is highly contagious, why protective measures are needed to contain its spread.

TMN believes COVID-19 is unlikely to peak or “end in the next few years.” Its archive has 1,173 articles on coronavirus over an extended period of time.

Perhaps like the 1918 -20 Spanish flu, the current outbreak may subside to be followed by one or more new strains that will infect unknown numbers of people.

It’s unknown how serious and long-lasting new strains will be to individuals in countries where they may appear — or what treatment protocols will be most effective. TMN noted that Big Pharma and governments are taking advantage of COVID-19 to serve their fiAnonymouscial and political interests respectively.

The website gets no government support, it said, adding:

It’s “based in a region where corruption, nepotism and ego” are rife. TMN should have explained that things are worse in the West.

The website relies on reader donations. It accepts no ads.

It claims hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are ineffective in treating COVID-19 and may only produce “a dangerous placebo” effect.

I yield to medical experts to judge the veracity of this judgment.

The former is an anti-malarial drug, the latter an antibiotic used to treat respiratory and other bacterial infections.

They’ve been no clinical trials to show if either or both of these drugs are effective in treating COVID-19.

For most individuals ill from the virus, it’s for them (with professional medical advice) to decide if they’re willing to be guinea pigs.

All drugs have side effects. The more potent the drug, the greater the risk of harm to patients by causing other potentially serious issues.

Older individuals with weak immune systems who are dealing with other health issues are most vulnerable to be adversely affected.

Michel Chossudovsky explained what’s vital for everyone to know. In a detailed article I strongly recommend reading carefully, he said the following:

“The unspoken truth is that the novel (COVID-19) coronavirus provides a pretext to powerful fiAnonymouscial interests and corrupt politicians to trigger the entire World into a spiral of  mass unemployment, bankruptcy, extreme poverty and despair.”

“This is the true picture of what is happening. ‘Planet Lockdown’ is an encroachment on civil liberties. Entire national economies are in jeopardy. In some countries martial law has been declared.”

“This crisis is unprecedented in World history. It is destabilizing and destroying people’s lives Worldwide. It’s a ‘War against Humanity.’ ”

“While it is presented to World public opinion as a WHO global health emergency, what is really at stake are the mechanisms of  ‘economic warfare’ sustained by fear and intimidation, with devastating consequences.”

“The economic and social impacts far exceed those attributed to the coronavirus.”

Medical science can resolve health issues. It’s powerless against dark forces that use an issue like COVID-19 for greater wealth and power at the expense of public and personal health, human and civil rights, and societies safe and fit to live in.

Today indeed is the most perilous time in world history. COVID-19 is being used by US-led powerful forces to convince ordinary people in the West and elsewhere to sacrifice personal freedoms for greater security.

Their aim is all about eliminating both by getting unwitting populations to accept what harms their well-being and futures.

It’s also about consolidating greater wealth and power, the public none the wiser.

Global and national crises are manufactured to serve the interests of dark forces.

What’s ongoing now is the mother of them all. The world as we know it is highly unlikely to be the same as COVID-19 plays out and when it ends.

In cahoots with the Obama regime, the Wall Street 2008-09 fiAnonymouscial crisis is likely to seen as minor by comparison to a growing tsunami of poverty, unemployment, underemployment, homelessness, food insecurity, hunger, overall deprivation and human suffering in the West and elsewhere that’s unfolding in real time.

The human rubble will best be understood when the dust finally settles.

If dark forces behind what’s going on prevail, new world order tyranny in the US, West, and elsewhere will replace life as we know it — a grim prospect indeed without mass resistance to prevent loss of our welfare and personal freedom.

456,The Oil Industryâ€™s Recovery Lacks One Important Ingredient | OilPrice.com,Cyril Widdershoven,"The growing global oil and gas glut, partly caused by the coronavirus global lockdown but also due to mismanagement of the US shale sector and the OPEC price war fall-out, is causing mayhem in all energy sectors.Most of the media&rsquo;s attention goes to upstream oil and gas operators and financial institutions. As US shale companies drown in debt, bankruptcies are expected to pile up within the next months. US shale, offshore oil and gas operators and most non-OPEC producers are going to be struggling to keep some air in the balloon that was filled the last years. In the next couple of months, due to OPEC production cuts and bankruptcies, a vast part of the overproduction will be removed, shrinking the glut to a much more acceptable level. Some analysts are even expecting growth before the end of 2020, based on misconceptions that oil prices could be even hovering around $40 per barrel at that time. Optimism based on simple Excel equations or mathematics are most probably going to be proven wrong.As long as the impact of the extended Covid-19 crisis on energy and on the global economy is not fully visible, and storage volumes are still building up, oil prices will probably stay low. At the same time, even if all goes back to a &lsquo;pre-corona normal&rsquo;, the normal will be different if nothing will have been learned from history.  A demand collapse such as we are witnessing at present has never been seen before. Demand destruction to the tune of 20-25 million bpd is a giant shock to the total energy system. Market watchers, however, are focusing too much on E&amp;Ps. The current financial situation of most NOCs, IOCs and large independent producers is not yet dire, while smaller drillers are already on life-support. The industry will, in the end, find the right balance again as much production from smaller producers will be shut in or disappear for good. The main objective for many producers is to be able to produce significant volumes at the end of the crisis. This is partly misunderstood in the media, as most operators are not the ones directly responsible for the production of hydrocarbons. The main players here are the oilfield services, the companies with the technical know-how and tools to produce a barrel of oil.  Premium Oil Storage Nears Its LimitOilfield service companies offer technologies and equipment to oil and natural gas drillers and are crucial in the exploration and completion process, but are also responsible for the manufacturing and mending of equipment. Overall, the fate of all oil service firms is positively correlated to crude prices and also to the capital investment decisions of E&amp;P operators.The current correlation however is very negative, as low oil prices hit oilfield services exponentially harder. It&rsquo;s strange to see that non-oil and gas analysts are understanding the threat better for other sectors, than oil and gas does. The threat to the survival and revamp of the automotive sector worldwide is not the cash-flow and debt levels of VW, Mercedes, Toyota or GM, but the survivability of the automotive part suppliers. Without automotive suppliers, no car or vehicle will leave the factory in Stuttgart or Detroit.&nbsp;  The situation is no different for the oil, gas and energy sector. Without oilfield services, production will stall and decline within months. The situation is dire for mainstream independent oilfield services companies, not only in US shale, where giants like Schlumberger, Halliburton or National Oilwell Varco are cutting their investments and workforce, but also in other non-OPEC and OPEC regions.One Oil &amp; Gas UK OGUK report already stated that the financial contagion triggered by historically low oil prices will threaten North Sea jobs, shrink its economic contribution and undermine energy security. According to Energy and Restructuring law firm Hayes and Boone&rsquo;s, last year already a grand total of 50 energy companies filed for bankruptcy, including 33 oil and gas producers, 15 oilfield services companies and two midstream companies. The law firm warns that as the crisis in 2020 continues, they fear that the ax could now fall on debt-ridden oilfield services companies. Just in North America, oilfield services companies debt is said to reach $32 billion which is coming due between 2020 and 2024.The poor financial state of the industry is well represented by the sector&rsquo;s favorite benchmark, the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF NYSEARCAOIH, which is down more than 70% YTD, considerably lower than the 30% plunge by the S&amp;P 500. Rystad&rsquo;s report last month that 20 percent of global oilfield services workers could be laid off this year has been undervalued as a real threat for the future. The firing of 1 million or more experts, drillers, engineers and workers means a possible productivity loss at the end of the year that will constrain a possible upsurge in demand and supply.&nbsp;  Premium The Oil Sector That Will Suffer The Most    Former oil and gas crises in the 1980s or 2010s have shown that knowledge destruction because of layoffs can significantly slow down a recovery in the sector. Taking into account that the average oil and gas worker is above 45 years of age, a large part of those becoming unemployed will never come back again. Additionally, the possible bankruptcy of small specialized oilfield services also will destroy specific knowledge not easy to be regained if demand is growing again. Former oil price collapses have led to a strategy change at IOCs, removing part of their inside capabilities in engineering and operations, cutting costs meant handing over project implementation to independent oilfield services. IOCs and NOCs are now doing the same again, putting most of the current crisis fall-out on oilfield services companies that will have no other option than to cut their workforce. Oilfield servicing margins, even in good times, have been under pressure.&nbsp;  Oil &amp; gas&rsquo; future faces several threats and lack of human capital is a very underestimated one that threatens profitability of the sector going forward. Without human capital, which in most cases is being provided by oilfield services, less oil and gas will be able to be produced, refined, stored or processed.&nbsp;  By Cyril Widdershoven for Oilprice.com",0,
76,NEUROSURGEON SAYS FACE MASKS POSE SERIOUS RISK TO HEALTHY PEOPLE,Megan Fox,"Every Karen on Facebook is shaming her neighbors for not wearing a face mask.

We are being told by governors that if we don’t wear them we are selfish, horrible human beings with no souls who want Grandma to die a horrible death. Police are tackling people who don’t wear them properly in the subway. Grocery stores are throwing maskless people out and denying them service. But now, there’s another doctor weighing in—besides Dr. Fauci, bonafide sex god and ruler of us all, who also said face masks are largely security theater and of no use to the healthy. Dr. Russell Blaylock, a neurosurgeon, has written an editorial saying that “masks pose serious risks to the healthy.”

First, Blaylock says, there is no scientific evidence that it is effective against COVID-19 transmission. Pro-science people should care about this.

As for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, “ None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”   Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission.

It is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history.

Beyond the lack of scientific data to support wearing a mask as a deterrent to a virus, Blaylock says the more pressing concern is what can and will happen to the wearer.

Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications.

There are studies to back that claim up.

In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers (47 males and 165 females) asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches.

They found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation (hypoxia) or an elevation in blood C02 (hypercapnia). It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death.

A more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask. Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance.

Blaylock says studies have also shown that face masks impair oxygen intake dramatically, potentially leading to serious problems.

The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.

In other words, if you wear a face mask and contract some sickness, you will not be able to fight it off as effectively as if you had normal blood oxygen levels. The mask could make you sicker. It could also create a “deadly cytokine storm” in some.

There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number.

How about cancer, heart attacks, and strokes? Blaylock says face masks can make all of those conditions worse.

People with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers. Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular (strokes) diseases.

If that’s not bad enough, how would you like COVID-19 in your brain?

It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain. In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.

Why is it that we only listen to dire predictions from Dr. Fauci and we don’t consult other experts in the field of medicine? Is Anthony Fauci the only qualified person to talk about this virus? Furthermore, if he is, he agrees with Dr. Blaylock that only sick people should wear them and he said so on 60 Minutes. So why aren’t we listening to him?",1,

440,"UK headed for historic slump as retail sales slide, firms close - Reuters","David Milliken, William Schomberg","LONDON (Reuters) - Britainâ€™s economy looks set for a widely feared record contraction after figures showed retail spending plunged by more than a quarter and one in four firms stopped trading temporarily due to the coronavirus lockdown. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) reported on Thursday a 27% year-on-year drop in sales in the two weeks to April 4, which included the period after the March 23 start of a lockdown that has shuttered shops other than supermarkets. â€œThe closure of non-essential shops led to deserted high streets and high double-digit declines in sales which even a rise in online shopping could not compensate for,â€ BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. A separate survey from the Office for National Statistics showed 25% of businesses had temporarily closed or paused trading since the lockdown. In those businesses that remained open, a fifth of workers had been placed on temporary leave. Britainâ€™s budget forecasters say the economy could be on track for an unprecedented 35% decline in the April-June period. Even if the lockdown eases and growth rebounds, annual output could still fall 13% in 2020, the biggest annual decline in over 300 years. Bank of England data, collected from March 2-20, showed lenders expect the biggest rise in business borrowing since the survey began in 2007 but for demand for new mortgages to fall by the most on record as the housing market freezes up. The government has promised to underwrite 330 billion pounds ($412 billion) of lending to businesses to keep them alive while large parts of the economy are closed, but banks are facing a big backlog of loan applications. The BRC said total retail spending in the five weeks to April 4 - this yearâ€™s March period for British retail sales - was down by 4.3% compared with the previous year. This fall came despite a surge in supermarket spending in the early part of the month, when British shoppers stocked up - and in some cases engaged in panic-buying - ahead of the lockdown. This was the biggest monthly fall since the series began in 1995, once distortions linked to the timing of Easter and Black Friday sales promotions are stripped out, the BRC said. Like-for-like sales, which take account of changes in floor space, dropped by 3.5%. Department store chain Debenhams and fashion brands Oasis and Warehouse are among the well-known British high street businesses to have fallen into financial difficulties in the past couple of weeks. Credit and debit card company Barclaycard reported a similar picture in its monthly spending data for March, which showed a 6.0% decline, the biggest since the survey began in 2015. While supermarket spending was up 21% on the month, travel spending, including public transport, sank by 40% and consumer confidence fell to a survey low. Just 25% of people surveyed felt confident about the economy, down from 42% in February. Editing by Stephen Addison and Andrew Cawthorne",0,
189,"Planet Coronavirus: Survival, Resistance and Regeneration",Ronnie Cummins,"Let’s talk about the real roots of this pandemic

Here’s what Jane Goodall recently said about the pandemic crisis:

“All over the world we’ve been destroying the places where animals live in order to get materials to build our homes, our cities and to make our own lives more comfortable. And as a result, we’ve brought the climate crisis on ourselves. Many species of animals and plants have become extinct. And our too-close relationship with wild animals in the markets, or when we use them for entertainment, has unleashed the terror and misery of new viruses.”

The coronavirus pandemic, like the climate crisis, is not an accident, nor an act of God. Both of these existential threats have arisen out of a U.S. and global food, farming, energy, resource extraction, economic, militaristic “national security” and trading system that is degenerative, unethical, inequitable and as we see now, self-destructive.

As Vandana Shiva points out:

“New diseases are being created because a globalized industrialized, inefficient food and agriculture model is invading the ecological habitat of other species and manipulating animals and plants with no respect for their integrity and their health . . . The health emergency that the coronavirus is waking us up to is connected to the emergency of extinction and disappearance of species, and it is connected to the climate emergency. All emergencies are rooted in a mechanistic, militaristic anthropocentric world view of humans as separate from, and superior to other beings whom we can own, manipulate and control. It is also rooted in an economic model based on the illusion of limitless growth and limitless greed . . . .”

Unless we can stop large corporations and desperate people from destroying the habitats of wild animals, such as bats, pangolins, and civets . . . unless we can shut down the animal factories where pigs, poultry and other hapless creatures are crammed together in filthy disease-ridden environments, stuffed with genetically engineered animal feeds and dosed with drugs guaranteed to spread antibiotic resistance and virulent pathogens . . . unless we can alleviate the poverty that forces people to cut down their forests and hunt and consume and bring to market wild creatures . . . unless we as conscious global citizens can stop buying and consuming the inhumane and dangerous factory-farmed foods and products made from forest-killing commodities such as industrial palm oil and GMO soybeans . . .  unless we can stop multinational corporations from clearcutting tropical rainforests, plowing up grasslands and savannas and destroying wetlands and marine ecosystems, and instead reforest, regenerate and restore damaged ecosystems . . . unless we can break down the walls of the factory farms and get 50 billion confined farm animals back out on the land grazing and foraging in a holistic and regenerative fashion that sequesters carbon and reduces rural poverty . . . unless we can carry out a global food, farming, land-use, energy and political regeneration, we will have more emerging viruses and diseases, an out-of-control climate emergency and the endless wars, poverty and conflict that arise out of our militarized “profit at any cost” economic system.

In Sonia Shan’s recent article in The Nation magazine she quotes epidemiologist Larry Brilliant, who once said, “Outbreaks are inevitable, but pandemics are optional.”

But, as Shan points out:

“ . . . pandemics only remain optional if we have the will to disrupt our politics as readily as we disrupt nature and wildlife. In the end, there is no real mystery about the animal source of pandemics. It’s not some spiky scaled pangolin or furry flying bat. It’s populations of warm-blooded primates: The true animal source is us.”

The myth of ‘national security’ and the global military-industrial complex: disturbing information

The whole notion of “national security” (i.e. “my army or my nuclear weapons or my biological weapons are more potent than yours”) is exposed as insanity when pandemics such as the coronavirus, or looming catastrophes such as runaway global warming (which will require global cooperation to stop greenhouse gas emissions and draw down excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and sequester them in our soils, plants and forests), rise up and pose existential threats to us all.

It’s not clear yet whether COVID-19 was weaponized in one of the world’s numerous, and secretive, chemical and biological warfare laboratories (such as the ones in Fort Detrick, Maryland, or the one in Wuhan, China) and then was accidentally or deliberately released, or whether its toxic potency was accelerated by “normal” genetic mutations as it passed from bats and pangolins through humans.

But there are disturbing facts about coronavirus, biowarfare and lax security in the world’s growing network of chemical and biological warfare labs that the commercial mass media and world governments aren’t telling us about.

Francis Boyle, a legal expert on chemical and biological weapons, who authored the U.S. Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989—passed uAnonymousimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law—and which bans offensive chemical and biological weapons and research, has stated that he believes the COVID-19 virus was weaponized and then accidentally released.

Boyle suspects COVID-19 is a weaponized pathogen that escaped from Wuhan City’s Biosafety Level 4 facility, which was specifically set up to research coronaviruses and SARS. According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material and possibly flu virus. It also has “gain of function properties” that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.

Last year (February 27, 2019) the Washington Post published a disturbing article entitled “The U.S. is funding dangerous experiments it doesn’t want you to know about.”

The newsletter WanttoKnow.info summarizes and comments upon the implications of the Washington Post article (which is now behind a paywall):

“In 2014, U.S. officials imposed a moratorium on experiments to enhance some of the world’s most lethal viruses by making them transmissible by air, responding to widespread concerns that a lab accident could spark a global pandemic. Apparently, the government has decided the research should now move ahead. In the past year, the U.S. government quietly greenlighted funding for two groups of researchers . . . to conduct transmission-enhancing experiments on the bird flu virus. Neither the approval nor the deliberations or judgments that supported it were announced publicly. This lack of transparency is unacceptable. Making decisions to approve potentially dangerous research in secret betrays the government’s responsibility to inform and involve the public when approving endeavors . . . that could put health and lives at risk. Hundreds of researchers . . . publicly opposed these experiments when they were first announced. In response to these concerns, the government issued a framework in 2017  for special review of ‘enhanced’ pathogens that could become capable of causing a pandemic. The framework . . . requires that experts in public-health preparedness and response, biosafety, ethics and law, among others, evaluate the work, but it is unclear from the public record if that happened. This secrecy means we don’t know how these requirements were applied, if at all, to the experiments now funded by the government.”

On August 5, 2019, the New York Times reported that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had closed down (since reopened) the most important chemical and biological warfare laboratory in the U.S. at Fort Detrick, Maryland, for biosecurity lapses, “problems with disposal of dangerous materials.” Shortly thereafter, the Guardian UK newspaper linked to a video in which the CDC Director, Robert Redfield seemed to admit at a Congressional hearing that “some cases”  i.e. deaths from the coronavirus, had been discovered in the U.S. before being identified in Wuhan—no doubt due to the previously documented inability of the U.S. to test and verify differences compared with the flu.

Watch this video interview with an experienced U.S. virologist, Judy Mikovits, who previously worked at Fort Detrick on weaponizing , and you’ll see why we desperately need to stop the madness, before it’s too late.

I could go on and on with other disturbing “coincidences.” Hopefully COVID-19 was not weaponized in a CBW lab such as Fort Detrick or Wuhan, or at worst it was an accidental release due to a biosecurity lapse, rather than an act of war, as the Chinese, Russians and Iranians are now claiming in response to Trumps’s belligerent characterization of COVID-19 as the “Chinese Virus.”

The point is that we need to stop weaponizing viruses and other pathogens in our so-called “defensive” chemical and biological weapons laboratories across the world, as international treaties dictate. We need to drop all U.S.- imposed economic sanctions across the world immediately, including those hampering current anti- COVID-19 measures in Russia, Cuba, Iran, Venezuela, Syria, North Korea and other nations.

We are all in this together. We need to stop bullying and threatening one another. We need to stop spending trillions of dollars on bombs and missiles and chemical and biological warfare programs and cooperate on waging war against the real monsters that are staring us in the face: COVID-19 and the global Climate Emergency.

The year 2020 will hopefully be remembered by our children and grandchildren as the transformational time when the global grassroots finally awakened to the existential threat of a Climate Emergency and the coronavirus pandemic, and forced our governments to cooperate and take decisive action.

Hopefully, 2020 will be recorded in the history books as a time when we mobilized, as never before, to overcome a national and global emergency, and launched a long-overdue political and social revolution, a U.S. and global Green New Deal.

Hopefully the future generations will be inspired by the unprecedented public education, grassroots lobbying, marketplace pressure, civil protest, mutual aid and farmer, energy, community and land-use innovation that will now be unfolding, galvanizing radical political and system change on a wartime scale, with a massive transfer of public and private investment from degenerative to regenerative practices.

If not, future generations will look back on 2020 as the beginning of the end.

We have an opportunity. As Paul Engler points out:

“Trigger events can create confusion and unease. But they also present tremendous opportunities for people who have a plan and know how to use the moment to push forward their agendas. These agendas can be reactionary, as when conservatives and fascists pass harsh austerity measures and spread xenophobia—the type of activity documented in Naomi Klein’s ‘The Shock Doctrine. Yet, this type of response need not prevail. With a counter-agenda rooted in a commitment to democracy and a deep sense of collective empathy, communities can flourish, even amid a crisis.”",1,
211,"As the lockdowns are lifted, don’t forget these 10 basic FACTS about the Wuhan coronavirus, or we’ll all suffer a catastrophic second wave of deaths planned by the globalists",Mike Adams,"The globalists would love for the lockdowns to last forever. It’s the perfect globalist enslavement system: You stay home and stay off the streets, they skim money from the money-printing Federal Reserve, then they mail you big fat bailout checks along with vote-by-mail ballots so you keep electing them to send you more money while you’re slowly bled to death with currency debasement and medical police state surveillance.

What more could a globalist hope for?

That’s why it’s crucial that We the People beat this virus before the globalists finish us off.

And the only way to do that is to get real about the threat of this very real, laboratory-concocted biological weapon system that has been deployed against humanity. Dr. Judy Mikovits agrees on this point, by the way, that the coronavirus went through a laboratory and is a very real, very dangerous pathogen that’s transmitted from person to person (see video below). And that makes it dangerous. All the more reason to get informed and learn how to beat this thing before we all end up starved to death and vaccinated like cattle with “kill switch” euthanasia jabs that are about to be rolled out across America.

Yes, you are the lab rat for Big Pharma’s insane medical experiments, didn’t you know? And you can’t protest as long as you’re locked down. You can’t even criticize the vaccine depopulation agenda because you’ll be censored by Big Tech and the communist Chinese who now control Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Your only function from here forward, from the point of view of the globalists, is to die as quickly as possible so they don’t have to deal with you anymore.

Because the globalists are literally at war with humanity, and your very existence is an affront to their agenda of depopulation and mass genocide against humanity.

Sadly, far too many people still remain in a state of denialism about the existence of the virus and how it has been deployed as a weapon against humanity. Denialism isn’t a strategy for a pro-human victory against this virus. Those who claim the virus doesn’t exist or is “just the flu” are hurting humanity’s ability to fight back. They’re actually compromising human freedom by interfering with our grassroots response to defeat this globalist bioweapon before the death science engineers kill us all with their gain-of-function weapons that are specifically designed to target human tissue.

So here are ten basic facts that I urge us all to keep in mind as we end the lockdowns and reopen our economies. If we forget these ten facts, we will pay a very steep price for complacency. We may, in fact, not survive the globalist plans for mass extermination.

Defeat the virus and you defeat the globalists. They were almost defeated already, which is why they released this “nuclear option” bioweapon in desperation, by the way. It’s their last play, and if we defeat this virus, we can finally move against the globalists and “hang them in the streets,” so to speak, for their crimes against us all.

Basic Fact #1) The Wuhan coronavirus was developed in a lab. This virus was engineered with gain-of-function properties to target human tissue and spread from person to person in “stealth” mode (asymptomatic carriers). That’s why it’s the most dangerous global pathogen we’ve ever faced — because it was engineered to kill human beings. No, this is no “natural” virus from bats. What a joke.

Basic Fact #2) The Wuhan coronavirus was released in China, then spread across the globe. Never forget that this was released in China but could not be contained there. It spread so effectively that it encircled the globe almost overnight, even with efforts to block air traffic and close borders. None of those efforts worked, and the virus exploded worldwide anyway. This virus was never “contained” and will never be contained by any incompetent government. It will continue to spread as the lockdowns are lifted.

Basic Fact #3) The Wuhan coronavirus is transmitted from person to person. It spreads from the lungs of one person to the lungs of another person. Hence the wisdom in wearing masks in shared indoor environments or public transportation. This also explains why its unmitigated infection rate is exponential, not linear. And it has just barely begun to infect a small percentage of the total human population. (There’s much more excitement yet to come…)

Basic Fact #4) People who don’t know they are infected and show no symptoms can spread it to others (asymptomatic carriers). This is the “stealth mode” that makes this virus so dangerous. People spread it even before they know they have it, and they can bypass simple measures (such as temperature checkpoints) with ease.

Basic Fact #5) The Wuhan coronavirus is orders of magnitude more deadly than the regular flu. The regular flu only kills about 1 in 4,000 who are infected (Infection Fatality Rate), or about 1 in 1,000 who are diagnosed and symptomatic (Case Fatality Rate). Yet the Case Fatality Rate for the Wuhan coronavirus looks to be about 10% so far, based on current numbers being reported around the world. That makes it about 100 times more deadly than the regular flu. (No, this ain’t the flu, bro.)

Basic Fact #6) The Wuhan coronavirus mutates rapidly and can mutate to express affinity for different receptors in the human body. This means it can morph into a whole new form that nullifies all existing immunity or whatever vaccines might be working at the time. Literally overnight, this virus can render all vaccines obsolete, and it can reset every human being on planet Earth back to the “uninfected” status based on its receptor site mutations. Imagine going through two years of the ACE2 version of the coronavirus only to find out it then mutates to a whole new receptor and we get to start all over. That’s not science fiction… it’s a very likely outcome.

Basic Fact #7) Because of the rapid mutation rate, a vaccine may never be developed that works against the Wuhan coronavirus. This is a fundamental science fact, and it probably explains why the CEO of Moderna — the vaccine company touted by Trump as offering a miracle treatment for the pandemic — is selling his own stock shares like mad instead of buying them up like mad. If he thought the vaccine was going to be a huge success, he’s be buying, not selling stock. Does he already know the vaccine will fail? That’s what it looks like.

Basic Fact #8) COVID-19 is not an acute respiratory disease but rather a blood clotting / coagulation and inflammation disease, and ventilators are killing patients. This means the “standard of care” offered in most hospitals is actually a death sentence, which is why 88% of people who are put on ventilators end up dead. It also means the fatality numbers for coronavirus didn’t have to be as large as they are now, since many people were actually killed by ventilators when they really needed oxygen.

Basic Fact #9) Nutrition plays a key role in preventing coronavirus infections and transmission. We now know that those who have excellent nutrition (vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, anti-inflammatory foods, etc.) almost never get killed by the coronavirus. We also know that natural treatments like chlorine dioxide have so far been shown to have a near-100 percent cure rate. But of course, anything that really works will be banned or criminalized because our world is controlled by a criminal drug cartel known as Big Pharma and the FDA. (The Food and DEATH Administration.)

Basic Fact #10) The only reason the number of hospitalizations and deaths is now falling in America is because the social distancing lockdowns worked. Without the lockdowns, the numbers would still be following an exponential expansion curve, and we would right now be witnessing perhaps 30,000 deaths per day in the United States. Thankfully, we’re really seeing something much closer to 1,000 deaths per day, down from about 2,800 per day. That achievement is largely due to the lockdowns.

In that realization is a stern warning for our shared future: If we end the lockdowns and pretend this virus is history, it will come back and bite us with a vengeance. Complacency will lead to catastrophe, which is why we must not become complacent as we work toward restoring more “normalcy” across society.

Denialism is a losing strategy, but facing this virus armed with facts and nutrition and real science, we can defeat it and move to defeat those who built it.

Join the pro-human resistance against the death science globalists who are trying to exterminate us all
It’s time for humanity to rise up around the planet and declare war on those governments, institutions and corporations that are deliberately working to exterminate us. It’s time for humanity to invoke its right to global self-defense and stop the atrocities being carried out against us by virologists, genetic engineers and vaccine Nazis. We either take a stand and fight for survival or we get exterminated in the next 1-2 years with wave after wave of deadly vaccines and depopulation bioweapons that will be released right on schedule.

You think Fauci’s knowledge of a “second wave” is just a lucky guess? Nope, he’s in on it. He knows the second wave is coming because he helped fund the second wave of bioweapons that are being readied for release right now.

You think the lockdowns will be over soon? Not a chance. They’ll have you under house arrest yet again before this year is finished, shivering with fright from a second round of bioweapons and engineered vaccines that actually spread the pandemic even faster.

If you want to live much longer, it turns out you’re going to have to earn the right to live by fighting against those who are trying to kill you. And you can’t do that sitting at home collecting an unemployment check and voting by mail to elect the next round of complicit, corrupt criminals who are all bought off by Big Pharma death cultists. At some point, you’re either going to have to get off your ass and join the pro-human uprising or surrender to the vaccine euthanasia shots and die on your knees as a subservient vaccine slave.",1,
234,Study Shows Direct Correlation Between 5G Networks and “Coronavirus” Outbreaks,Dee McLachlan,"The first study demonstrating a relationship between “coronavirus” outbreaks and the presence of 5G networks has emerged from Spain and is by Bartomeu Payeras i Cifre. Bartomeu is a biologist specializing in microbiology and is working at the University of Barcelona. His original source study can be sourced HERE, and is has been translated into English by Claire Edwards (on SOTN).
The study, I believe, is hugely significant in that it demonstrates clearly the most likely probability that the COVID-19 hypoxic injuries and hospital admissions are directly related to electromagnetic radiation exposure by 5G Networks. Governments across the world can argue ‘till the cows come home that 5G is safe and that there is no correlation to the coronavirus outbreaks — but the revelation of this data seems irrefutable.
Some of the more startling discoveries are:
The nine countries with the most infections worldwide all receive 5G radiation from satellites.
Comparing four nearby countries of the same latitude: Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece. The two countries with 5G (Spain and Italy) have 220% more infections than Portugal and Greece.
The comparison between the small State of San Marino (Italy) and Croatia (just across the Adriatic Sea) is astonishing. San Marino was the first European state to get 5G technology, and has the highest rate of infection. San Marino is 2.59 times more than Italy and 27 times more than Croatia — a country that does not have 5G.
The five hot cities in Italy align with the 5G rollouts, as does Spain. Even the hot spots in Barcelona and Madrid align with 5G coverage. Another very interesting comparison is between Mexico and the US. Rates in the 5G-US are 2.7 per 1000 inhabitants, whereas Mexico (no 5G) is 0.04/1000. Another astonishing observation is Africa — a continent almost devoid of infections, except for South Africa. Well Bartomeu claims that only South Africa has 5G. As a further observation from me, most of the Australian cases were from those off the 5G-cruise ships and coming off international flights. Were they flying close to 5G satellites?
Bartomeu’s observations about 5G-China and surrounding countries is yet another red flag. The countries surrounding China had approximately 10X fewer cases. Myanma has 0.0007/1000 inhabitants infection rate.
It is clear from this biologist’s research that 5G plays a part in this plandemic. One has to assume the government researchers know of the impacts on the human body. It would be easy and inexpensive to conduct experiments to test the health impact on humans and other life forms. They must have decided the risk of 5G frequencies worth taking.
The only discussion remaining is: do the benefits of 5G outweigh the deaths and health effects of EMF radiation on humans and all life on the planet? ",1,
171,US TIGHTENS THE NOOSE ON CHINA AS A RESULT OF CORONAVIRUS CAMPAIGN,Shane Quinn,"An underlying theme behind the Western political and media focus on the coronavirus, is to damage and undermine China's international standing, the country where this disease is commonly purported to have spread forth from. Prominent American politicians like Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, have publicly labelled the illness as ""the Wuhan coronavirus"", in an attempt to harm China's reputation and lay the blame at Beijing's door. 

Throughout this century, China has represented the main threat to American global hegemony, and this threat to US power has gradually been growing as elites in the West are only too aware. The coronavirus, whose spectre is being exaggerated by the establishment, provides an excuse to tighten the choke-hold on China. 

This is happening in the shadows, away from the public glare. Indeed, China is already surrounded by hundreds of US military bases in the east Asian and Pacific regions, and for well over a year Beijing has been embroiled in a bitter trade war with Washington. 

Although it may sound cynical, we can recognise another central factor behind the coronavirus hyperbole: that it is being exploited by the powers-that-be, in order to frighten and keep under control a world populace which has increasingly been rebelling against the assaults of neoliberal globalisation (1). A supposedly all-consuming virus is an ideal opportunity to warn the public not to gather outside in large groups, to remain isolated from each other and stay indoors. Simply put, be obedient and passive.

A serious infectious ailment like the coronavirus does, up to a point, merit attention and concern. It would be disingenuous to suggest otherwise, particularly when the cases are notably increasing in number. The coronavirus is far more dangerous in comparison to influenza (flu) – on up to date statistics, it has a death rate which is more than 20 times greater than the flu (2). Yet these figures are evolving, and will change over the course of time, becoming more or less severe; quite often the latter case.

It is important to put the coronavirus into context and provide some perspective. Since late December 2019 until the present, just over 4,600 deaths have officially been attributed to the illness, out of a global human population of 7.8 billion. This makes a world death toll of a tiny fraction of 1%. Among those who have died, just over 3,000 of them were Chinese citizens, comprising more than 60% of the combined fatality count. 

As things stand, one is far more likely to suffer death in an automobile accident, than either contracting the coronavirus or succumbing to it. Each year there are around 1.3 million deaths worldwide from traffic accidents. Almost 40,000 people were killed on the roads in America during 2019; in China, there are on average 250,000 road fatalities each year. The number of cars worldwide are responsible for 20% of global carbon emissions. 

Nevertheless there are no large-scale media campaigns directed against the hazards of vehicles. Quite the opposite, car manufacturers are regularly advertised in the corporate press; who, at the same time, claim to have sincere concerns about the worsening climate crisis. 

Since the first coronavirus case was said to have occurred in eastern China over two months ago, there are at the time of writing a reported 130,000 coronavirus infections globally – with it thought to have spread to 113 nations and counting, more than half of the world's countries (3). However, this does not constitute a pandemic, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) mistakenly insists, who themselves have a somewhat dubious history in these affairs, as will be discussed below further.

A pandemic is an outbreak of disease that is occurring over both a wide geographic area “and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population” (4). This stark description, which can be found in separate dictionaries, seems to have escaped the attention of the WHO. It cannot be claimed that over 100,000 infections out of a world population of almost eight billion is an exceptionally high proportion of the population. This ratio accounts once more to a small fraction of 1% of all humans. In reality this is not remotely a pandemic as of yet.

Panic-inducing media headlines fail to mention that the majority of all coronavirus cases have still occurred in mainland China, where more than 80,000 people are reported to have been infected.

Even in this instance, there are firm indications that the disease has successfully been contained by Beijing's authorities (5). Over three weeks ago and more, around 2,000 new coronavirus cases were recorded in China daily; but this worrying figure has dropped dramatically, with a mere 40 new cases in China occurring on Monday this week, the lowest number since tracking began. If the virus can be smothered in the world's most populace country, surely the same can be achieved elsewhere.

States such as Italy and Iran, with much smaller populations than China, are well advised in seeking Beijing's counsel on how to suppress this disease. 

Much of the reporting on the coronavirus has been misleading and sensationalist. It is receiving an extent of media coverage that is not afforded to much more serious issues, like nuclear weapons and climate change – in particular the nuclear threat, which is barely focused on or even understood, despite the fact it remains the single greatest threat facing mankind. 

The American author and military analyst Daniel Ellsberg said last year that, “It is true that climate change may totally disrupt civilisation as we know it, but how many lives would it cost? Whatever the number, some form of civilisation would probably survive. By contrast, a nuclear winter, which has a non-zero possibility of occurring, would occasion near extinction”. (6)

Ellsberg estimates that two years after a nuclear winter – which would spread globally in the weeks following a nuclear war between America and Russia or China – that about 100,000 people would be left alive out out of 7.8 billion. Hence his accurate description of “near extinction” for humanity, in the event of a nuclear war between the major powers. One will do well to find mention of this in mass media journals, however.

An interested scholar will also have to search hard in newspaper archives to learn anything about the near-deadly accidents, involving nuclear bombs through the decades, of which there have been many. (7)

One should be cautious whenever the mainstream press and first world politicians strongly push a certain agenda. This was most obvious in recent years with the ludicrous claims that Moscow decided the 2016 US presidential election in Donald Trump's favour, which the American public paid scant attention to. 

The WHO, who have a history of unnecessarily overestimating threat of infectious diseases under suspect circumstances, have done little to dampen the hysteria regarding the coronavirus. According to the experienced German physician Wolfgang Wodarg, who is also an expert in analysing the spread of contagious diseases, the WHO is “unduly influenced by pharmaceutical companies”, as came to light with the swine flu pandemic of a decade ago. 

The swine flu of 2009 to 2010 can be classed as a pandemic, with 700 million to 1.4 billion people infected with what was an overall mild ailment (8). This may have consisted of up to 21% of the planet's then human population.  

The chief goal of the pharmaceutical industry, which is held dominion over by giant corporate entities, is to the requirements of short-term profit-making, like all corporations. Dr Wodarg further remarked of the swine flu in relation to pharmaceutical companies that, “the declaration of a pandemic hugely enriched the industry at the expense of taxpayers and governments”. (9)

The business of big pharma is accumulation of wealth for their elite base, and not in serving the public interest. An infamous virus represents a fiAnonymouscial opening and boAnonymousza for pharmaceutical corporations. The coronavirus is being capitalised upon with the assistance of politicians and media, whose actions are often dictated by large businesses in the neoliberal era. The media are reliant on revenue from corporate advertising, including big pharma adverts. Most media companies even have pharmaceutical representatives sitting in their boardrooms. (10)

During the panic regarding the swine flu, pharmaceuticals enjoyed billions of dollars worth of profits, as governments were compelled to stockpile huge levels of drugs and vaccines, most of which were never used. The WHO guidelines were written up by scientists on the payroll of big pharma. Paul Flynn, a veteran former British Labour MP, said that “The tentacles of drug company influence are in all levels in the decision-making process” (11). This very likely remains the case pertaining to the coronavirus. 

There is another significant reason behind the campaigns of virus scaremongering. A critical one is to try to weaken China as a state, by impacting negatively upon Beijing's ability to spread its fiAnonymouscial clout and influence across continents. As a result of the coronavirus frenzy, the Chinese government is “losing leverage in dealings with the US and other developed countries” while “the US economy and markets could actually benefit from the coronavirus”. (12)

China is the only nation that can even attempt to challenge American domiAnonymousce in the global arena. Over these past 20 years China's neighbour, Russia, has re-emerged as a major power under Vladimir Putin, with Moscow's presence on the international scene having grown considerably. Regardless, Russia remains an appreciably weaker country when compared to the US. In military terms alone, the Kremlin's annual arms expenditure amounts to less than 10% of the US, and this gap is widening. 

China's military budget, the second largest in the world, is about a third that of America's. The vast economic projects of Beijing, like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), are being constructed on an unprecedented scale in modern history. This has drawn considerable international and economic influence to China, not to mention prestige. 

It would have been unimaginable at the end of World War II – when American strength was at its peak – that the western superpower would have no involvement in a landmark industrial program such as the Belt and Road, which is headquartered in Beijing. Unfortunately for Washington this has proven the case.

The Americans are also excluded from Beijing's other milestone associations, like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The AIIB, centred in the Chinese capital and established in 2015, can count among its members crucial US allies like Britain, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Australia and South Korea; along with dozens of other countries, some of them NATO states. This is a major development in international affairs, as many traditional American-friendly nations defy Washington's wishes in entering organisations controlled by Beijing. ",1,
233,"WATCH: Bill Gates Admits His COVID-19 Vaccine Might KILL Nearly 1,000,000 People",CLOVERCHRONICLE,"Microsoft co-founder and “philanthropist” Bill Gates recently admitted his vaccine for coronavirus (COVID-19) is less effective in the elderly and will most likely result in the death or maiming of 700,000 people. “…The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people. Most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly.

“Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that.

“So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges – you know pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities – it’s very, very hard, and that actual decision of ‘okay, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world,’ governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.”",1,
227," Cover Up: Fauci Approved Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine 15 Years Ago to Cure Coronaviruses; “Nobody Needed to Die”",True Pundit,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.

How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak – caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV – the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.

The Virology Journal – the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health – published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading – get ready for this – “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Write the researchers, “We report…that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”

This means, of course, that Dr. Fauci (pictured at right) has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will not only treat a current case of coronavirus (“therapeutic”) but prevent future cases (“prophylactic”). So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”

Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus. He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events.

“In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”

The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.

But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.

Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.

On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings. The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.

While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”

So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died.",1,
165,"EU left Italy ‘practically alone' to fight coronavirus, so Rome looked for help elsewhere, incl Russia – ex-FM Frattini to RT",Anonymous,"The EU’s initial response to the massive outbreak of coronavirus in Italy was largely “inadequate,” and a lack of European solidarity opened the doors for Russia and China, former Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told RT.
The new epicenter of the dreaded pandemic, Italy, has been struggling to stop the spread of Covid-19 for weeks now. The disease has already killed more than six thousand people in the country, with over 60 thousand people infected.

EU tried to pin the blame on Italy
The EU clearly underestimated the virus, blaming the outbreak in Italy on its national healthcare system flaws, according to the two-time foreign minister and OSCE representative. As a result, Brussels, which preaches pan-European solidarity, failed to act when this solidarity was needed in the face of a crisis that eventually affected the entire bloc.",1,
186,AUSTRIAN STUDY FINDS ‘SIGN OF HUMAN INTERVENTION’ IN CORONAVIRUS,Steve Watson,"A scientific study in Austria has found that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that has led to a pandemic, was likely created in a lab, barring some “remarkable coincidence” that led to the virus naturally evolving to be optimised to attack human cells.

The study was led by Nikolai Petrovsky, a vaccine researcher at Flinders University. The scientists in his team discovered that the coronavirus is optimized for penetration into human cells, rather than animal cells, which means that the theory that it emerged from an animal market and jumped to humans naturally is unlikely.

Lifesite News reports that the scientists “used a version of the novel coronavirus collected in the earliest days of the outbreak and applied computer models to test its capacity to bind to certain cell receptor enzymes, called “ACE2,” that allow the virus to infect human and animal cells to varying degrees of efficacy.”

“They found that “the novel coronavirus most powerfully binds with human ACE2, and with variously lesser degrees of effectiveness with animal versions of the receptor.”

The authors believe this means that the virus “became specialized for human cell penetration by living previously in human cells, quite possibly in a laboratory.”

The Study notes that  “a virus would be expected to have highest affinity for the receptor in its original host species, e.g. bat, with a lower initial binding affinity for the receptor of any new host, e.g. humans. However, in this case, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher for humans than for the putative original host species, bats, or for any potential intermediary host species.”

It continues, noting that a “possibility which still cannot be excluded is that SARSCoV-2 was created by a recombination event that occurred inadvertently or consciously in a laboratory handling coronaviruses, with the new virus then accidentally released into the local human population.” Dr Petrovsky added in a statement that, rather than being rapidly genetically spliced and mutated, the virus shows signs of being  ‘cultured’ to evolve over time.

“Our and other analyses of the genomic sequence of the virus do not reveal any artificial gene inserts that would be the hallmark of a gene jockey, genetic engineers who manipulate or even create viruses by splicing in artificial inserts into their genome.” Petrovsky said.

“These are generally easily recognisable and hence clear signatures of human intervention in the creation of a virus. The fact that these artificial inserts are not present has been interpreted by some to mean this virus is not the result of human manipulation.” he added.

“However, this logic is incorrect as there are other ways in which humans can manipulate viruses and that is caused by natural selection,” he continued, adding that “you can force [a] bat virus to adapt to infect human cells via mutations in its spike protein,” after culturing it for a few years.

“The result of these experiments, according to the doctor, would be “a virus that is highly virulent in humans but is sufficiently different that it no longer resembles the original bat virus.”

If all of this sounds familiar, it is because this is exactly what the scientists inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology were doing with bat borne coronaviruses.",1,
454,Lockdown end date 18MONTHS away says health minister Nadine Dorries in extraordinary claim | UK | News | Express.co.uk,Emily Ferguson," The Government was thrown into chaos this evening when Ms Dorries said the UK could be in lockdown until the end of 2021. In an extraordinary break from the No10's official line, Ms Dorries has said the nation-wide lockdown will not be lifted until a vaccine has been made, which experts say won't become unavailable for at least 18 months. The Tory MP said on Twitter: ""Journalists should stop asking about an â€˜exit strategy.â€™ ""There is only one way we can â€˜exitâ€™ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. ""Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy."" Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said the claim was ""astonishing"" and described it as a remarkable break from previous Government statements on when the lockdown will end.   Other social media users reacted furiously to the health minister's comment. One person said: ""If we have to wait 12 to 18 months for a vaccine, what will there be left to come out to? Mass unemployment, mass poverty and a mental health epidemic of seismic proportions."" Another user wrote: ""If we carry this on much longer without certain sectors being able to go back to work there will be nothing for us to go back to if we have to wait 9 - 18 months for a vaccine."" A third asked what happens if scientists don't come up with a vaccine.  They wrote: ""There is no guarantee of a vaccine. What's the plan if we don't manage to obtain one, eternal lockdown?"" Another person said: ""She has no idea. Lockdown will end when we can ramp up testing and work out the true infection rate in the population."" During today's daily coronavirus press briefing Health Secretray Matt Hancock said the nationwide lockdown would not be lifted until it was safe to do so. British scientists are competing with dozens of laboratories around the world to be the first to develop a coronavirus vaccine, but one is not expected to be ready for another 18 months.  The World Health Organization has said there are currently 70 vaccines in development. Three different groups, one in China and two in the US, have already began trials on humans. Oxford University scientists will begin human trials next week, after already recruiting 510 volunteers. The researchers are confident they will have a vaccine ready by the autumn.   But public health officials say it will still take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine â€“ despite human trials beginning. Britain's chief scientific adviser last month said that it would be at least 2021 before a vaccine was ready. The Department of Health has been approached for a comment.

432,Coronavirus vaccine could be 'ready to be rolled out' in 2020 as human trials get go-ahead | UK | News | Express.co.uk,Aurora Bosotti," A team of virologist working on a vaccine for the coronavirus at Imperial College London have just been awarded Â£1.8 million in funding to further their vaccine to human trials.

58,The Farce and Diabolical Agenda of A “Universal Lockdown”,Peter Koenig,"First comes the farce, an (almost) universal government lie around the globe about a deadly virus, WHO named COVID-19. The decision for a global lockdown – literally for the collapse of the world economy – was already taken at the WEF conference in Davos, 21 – 24 January 2020. On January 30, WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). At that time, there were only 150 known COVID-19 cases outside of China. No reason whatsoever to declare a pandemic. On March 11, Dr. Tedros, DG of WHO converted the PHEIC into a pandemic. This gave the green light for the start if implementing “The Plan”.

The pandemic was needed as a pretext to halt and collapse the world economy and the underlying social fabric.

There is no coincidence. There were a number of preparatory events, all pointing into the direction of aworldwide monumental historic disaster. It started at least 10 years ago – probably considerably earlier – with the infamous 2010 Rockefeller Report, which painted the first phase of a monstrous Plan, called the “Lock Step” scenario. Among the last preparatory moves for the “pandemic” was Event 201, held in NYC on 18 October 2019.

The event was sponsored by the Johns Hopkins Center for Public Health, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the World Economic Forum (WEF), the club of the rich and powerful that meets every January in Davos, Switzerland. Participating were a number of pharmaceuticals (vaccine interest groups), as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s of the US and – of China.

One of the objectives of Event 201 was a computer simulation of a corona virus pandemic. The simulated virus was called SARS-2-nCoV, or later 2019-nCoV. The simulation results were disastrous, killing 65 million people in 18 months and plunging the stock market by more than 30% — causing untold unemployment and bankruptcies. Precisely the scenario of which we are now living the beginning.

The Lock Step scenario foresees a number of ghastly and disturbing events or components of The Plan to be implemented by the so called Agenda ID2020, a Bill Gates creation, fully integrated into the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) – target date for completion – 2030 (also called Agenda 2030, the hidden agenda unknown to most of the UN members), the same target date for completion of the Agenda ID02020.

Here, just the key elements as a precursor to what the world is living now, and what is to come, if we don’t stop it – to demonstrate how this entirely criminal sham has been planned. Parts of the scenario are:

A massive vaccination program, probably through compulsory vaccination – Bill Gates’ dream and brainchild is vaccinating 7 billion people.
Massive population reduction, a eugenics plan – in part through vaccination and other means (Ref. Bill Gates, “if we are doing a real good job vaccinating, we may reduce the world population by 10% to 15%”. See “Innovating to Zero!”, speech to the TED2010 annual conference, Long Beach, California, February 18, 2010).
Bill Gates has been advocating for years the need for a massive population reduction – and indeed the more than 20 years of the BMGF’s extensive vaccination programs in Africa, India and other places around the world have seen a record of involuntary sterilization of women between 14 and 49 years. See In 2014 and 2015 Kenya carried out a massive tetanus vaccination program, sponsored by WHO and UNICEF.

An electronic ID for every person on the planet – in the form of a Anonymouso chip, possibly injected along with the mandatory vaccination. This Anonymouso-chip could be remotely uploaded with all personal data.
Digitized money, no more cash.
Universal rolling out of 5G, later to be followed by 6G.
This is leading to a total control of every individuum on the planet. It is sold to the public as the Internet of Things (TIT), meaning self-driving cars, robotized kitchen equipment, artificial intelligence (AI) for the production and delivery of everything. What the sales pitch doesn’t say, is how humans would be marginalized and enslaved. To carry this masterplan forward, high frequency electromagnet waves are needed. Therefore, rolling out of 5G is a must, no matter what the health impact on humans, fauna and flora may be – and no matter how it may influence viral infections, like possibly the current COVID19.

WHO remains silent, although they do admit that no independent official study has been carried out on the dangers of 5G – and electromagnetic fields in general. Does that mean that WHO is coopted by the Big and Powerful into this deadly spiel? – Let it suffice to say that unlike other UN agencies, WHO was created in 1948 by the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) – see The Lancet. It might be also noteworthy that about half of WHOs budget comes from private interest sources, mostly the pharma industry, but also others, like telecom giants.

This is a precursor for understanding how things are being planned. It may help connecting the dots for what is coming.

It may also help us understand what is happening right now, in the first phase of the Lock Step scenario. It portrays in vivid colors the criminal nature of the Dark Deep State.

Never mind the stock market crash – that’s a speculator’s syndrome, rich people’s risks, as the stock market is a western invention to play with capital and capital gains to the detriment of the workers, whose lives depend on working that capital. They are the first ones to go, when Big Money calls for a merger – or a bankruptcy.



Now the almost universal and justified by NOTHING quarantine, total lockdown of every business, small or big – restaurants, construction, tourism, little and big hardware stores, bakeries, air lines, transport – interrupted supply chains – factories, food processing – and it goes on and on.

In the Global North some up to 90% of business transactions are emanating from small and medium size enterprises (SME). Almost all of them are closed now. Two thirds or more of them may never open again. Employees and workers are laid off, or are reduced to part-time work, meaning part-time pay – but still need to sustain their families. Poverty and desperation set in and becomes rampant. No future in sight. Suicide rates will rise – see Greece in the 2008 / 2009 crisis – and up to ten years later – broken families, foreclosures, families expulsed from rental apartments because they can no longer pay their rents. Street begging becomes normal, except there is nobody left to spare a dime.

In Europe at least a third to maybe 50% or more of the work force – depending on the country and structure of the labor force – is expected to be unemployed or will be reduced to part time work. And that’s only the beginning. In the US official unemployment figures are as of this writing in excess of 23 million – and are expected, by predictions of the FED, Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg -to reach between 32% and 40% in the next quarter. Bankruptcies may spin out of control.

The IMF predicts for 2020 a worldwide economic contraction of a mere 3% – and a small growth rate in the latter part of 2021. How utterly ridiculous! – What planet are these people on? Whom are they trying to fool, and why? Perhaps to encourage countries to borrow huge amounts of foreign exchange from these predatory Bretton Woods institutions, IMF and World Bank – to get deeply into debt, thinking with IMF predictions they will be fine? – Further enslavement by deceit?

This is the Global North – which has some kind of social safety nets, whatever flimsy they may be – there is a sliver of hope for relief. Another sliver of hope is built on the premises that mankind will be constantly creating – working ingeniously inventing -moving forward flowing like a river towards new horizons, creating new dynamics, new jobs… yes, that’s what mankind can do – and in our comfort we have forgotten this virtue – an essential virtue for survival – survival of the corona crisis.

The Global South – or developing countries – presents a grimmer story. Under normal circumstances a third to half of the economy is informal, meaning not tight to any norm of formal or legal organization. They are short-term workers, daily, hourly laborers – living from hand-to-mouth, no savings, no safety nets- and in most cases no health coverage. They are left to the whims of the “market”, literally. Now the market collapsed.

There is nothing left. No work, no income, no money to pay for food, rent, medication – and the government orders them, the deprived poverty-stricken, to stay ‘home’ – ‘lockdown’ in quarantine – to protect themselves from a virus, an imposed virus that nobody sees, but the government and the media make sure you are aware – and SCARED – of its dangers, you never know whether true or false.

Confinement at ”home”? – Where is home? Home is gone. No money to pay rent. Keep social distance – don’t get together. Stay apart. The infection could spread. Fear is of the essence.

Take a city like Lima, Peru. Peru’s total population about 30 million. Lima, about eleven million – of which some 3 to 4 million live on the margins or below – in shantytowns, or worse. Daily, or hourly laborers. They live sometimes hours away from their work place. Now, there is no workplace anymore. They have no money to pay for food, transport or rent – landlords put them in streets, expel them from their properties. How can they stay in confinement? How can they take care of themselves by quarantine – lockdown – having no shelter, no food – desperately looking to earn just enough money to survive another day – and perhaps to share with their families? They can’t.

Lockdown-protection (sic-sic) is only for the rich. The poor they starve with kids and families – and quite possibly with the corona disease. They live within the circles of poverty and misery, where there is nothing to spare. Nobody has anything. Not even in solidarity. There simply is nothing. Total deprivation, caused by a total economic standstill – forced upon the world and especially the poor by evil men – and perhaps also evil women.

These 3 to 4 or 5 million people, they all have come at one point or another from the rural provinces, for which the government does nothing, or not enough to keep them there. So, in search of a better life, they abandon their ‘çhacras’ (little plots of land) and move to the Big City – to paradise – where they are relegated to live in more misery than in their provincial meagre settlements. They endure – always with hope. Now this – the man-made corona crisis – has made life even worse, much worse for them. There are none or far from enough government handouts – or they come too late or get lost in corruption.

In solidarity they assemble. They need to get back to their provincial origins, to their çhacras, to their families – where they will get shelter and food, where they again may feel “home” and loved or at least welcome.

A dictatorial military style government prevents them from leaving – for security reasons, of course – they may infect other people, — the farse continues. And nobody says peep. Nobody dares, for fear of being locked away. Police brutality – sticks, tear gas – repression – back to no shelter – no food. Until the central almighty government decides to “organize” repatriation – by buses, but there is not enough capacity, nor organization – chaos emerges – and the lot gets worse – and how much worse can it get? Famine will strike, will make them weaker and weaker, more prone to diseases and to die – not fromCOVID19, but from famine. But as statistics go, MUST go, by orders of the Masters, such deaths will automatically be attributed to the corona pandemic. Naturally. It’s done elsewhere, in the Global North. Why not in the Global South?

Lima is just a case in point – Its representative probably for most of Latin America, except for Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba – where, in the midst of misery, there is still a sense of solidarity uniting the people – where the government stands with the people, yet, where people are more severely suffering, because of western sanctions – they are literally being murdered by western sanctions – foremost the US of A. A genocidal nation.",1,

258,Is Covid-19 man made and released from a Wuhan lab? Evidence of genome editing,Deplorable Patriot,"I’ve been seeing a lot of the same story being told by various media outlets.  All  pushing the same  narrative, “scientists confirm Covid–19 is not a man–made bioweapon”.  It’s only fair that I show the other side of the argument.

There is a scientist that says covid-19 is man made and was released from Wuhan lab.  The story was first published on March 2. 2020.

A Taiwanese scientist has claimed Chinese microbiologists probably created coronavirus in Wuhan, China.

Based on the virus unusual structure it is most likely “man made” and there is a theory coronavirus was somehow leaked or released from the Institute of Virology in Wuhan China, said Professor Fang Chi-tai from the National Taiwan University (NTU).

Professor Fang said China’s track record with safety standards and laboratory management has been questioned in the past.

The Professor claims it was very possible that the Wuhan Chinese scientists created the deadly virus by simply adding four amino acids to an existing bat virus, which therefore makes it much easier to transmit to people.

Professor Fang added, “The mutations found in the novel coronavirus are unusual in an academic sense.

“It is indeed possible that it is a man-made product.

“From an academic point of view, it is indeed possible that the amino acids were added to COVID-19 in the lab by humans.”

I should point out that Wuhan has the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It’s a level 4 laboratory that was used to store, handle and research samples of SARS, Ebola and other deadly infectious viruses. Fang mentioned the possibility of the virus being leaked from there due to gross mismanagement.  Fang also said,

Analyses of the Covid-19 virus have shown that it had a 96% genetic similarity with an RaTG13 bat virus also stored at the institute, and that the Covid-19 could be “manufactured” by modifying the RaTG13 virus.

French researchers had discovered four more amino acids in the gene sequence of Covid-19 than other known coronaviruses, which could be added artificially to make the viral transmission easier.

The following was also mentioned,

In February Chinese scientist announced the true cause of the spread of coronavirus, who broke cover and said the oubreak started in a science laboratory in Wuhan yards away from a wet market.

A scientist told how a sick bat attacked the researchers and bled on them and urinated on another, they were then forced to quarantine themselves for 14 days.

Biologists Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao published a pre-print entitled “The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus.”

The report describes how “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.

“We noted two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus in Wuhan, one of which was only 280 metres from the seafood market.

“We briefly examined the histories of the laboratories and proposed that the coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory.

EVIDENCE FOR RNA EDITING IN THE TRANSCRIPTOME OF 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS
For additional evidence of human influence in  the Coronavirus, I’ve provided a link to a PDF file titled  “Evidence for RNA editing in the transcriptome of 2019 Novel Coronavirus”.

It comes from bioRxiv.  You won’t hear anything about this in main stream news.  I’ve seen 1 article and it was an attempt to debunk the discovery by accusing the scientists of running a “shabby operation”.   Still, the critic never said the discovery was inaccurate.",1,
418,"Arsenal announce 12.5% pay cuts for players, coaching staff - Reuters",,"LONDON (Reuters) - Arsenalâ€™s players and coaching staff have agreed a 12.5% salary cut due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making the London-based club the first in the Premier League to announce such a measure. Several Premier League clubs have furloughed employees since the new coronavirus outbreak while others, such as West Ham United and Southampton, have said their players have accepted wage deferrals. League leaders Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Bournemouth reversed decisions to furlough non-playing staff following criticism. ""We are pleased to announce that we have reached a voluntary agreement with our first-team players, head coach and core coaching staff to help support the club at this critical time,"" Arsenal said in a statement here on Monday. â€œReductions of total annual earnings by 12.5% will come into effect this month, with the contractual paperwork being completed in the coming days.â€ Arsenal added that â€œagreed amountsâ€ would be repaid if specific targets primarily linked to success on the pitch were met in the seasons ahead. The club said the agreement with players was based on the assumption of the 2019/20 season being completed and the club receiving its full share of broadcasting revenues. â€œThe resulting savings will help cover some of the financial risks we have this season in relation to our matchday and commercial income,â€ the club added. Arsenal were ninth in the league table, eight points adrift of fourth place which guarantees qualification to the lucrative Champions League, when soccer in England was suspended indefinitely last month due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

208,"Can 5G exposure alter the structure and function of hemoglobin, causing coronavirus patients to die from oxygen deprivation?",Mike Adams,"Is 5G to partially blame for coronavirus deaths? Can 5G cause the blood that’s circulating in your body to be unable to carry oxygen?

What’s especially horrifying about the critical care of coronavirus patients is that they aren’t suffering from “viral pneumonia,” but rather from an inability to absorb or carry oxygen in the blood.

This has been confirmed by NYC ICU emergency physician Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who has released several videos detailing how coronavirus is not a kind of viral pneumonia. “We’re treating the wrong disease,” he says. And the ventilators are damaging the lungs of patients. He explains:

COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen. What this emergency room physician makes clear is that coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen deprivation, not a classic scenario of viral pneumonia. The patients’ lungs work fine, in other words, and the ventilators are actually damaging their lungs by forcing excessive pressure into them.

How, exactly, can all these patients be starved of oxygen when their lungs are technically working just fine? To understand one possible answer, you have to first understand how the blood carries oxygen. It’s way more fascinating than you might have supposed.

When functioning normally, 1 molecule of hemoglobin binds with 4 molecules of oxygen, using iron (Fe2+), forming oxyhemoglobin. But this binding is only achieved because of something called “partial pressure” which means the concentration of oxygen in the lung tissues is higher than the concentration of oxygen on the hemoglobin molecule (roughly stated, this is simplified somewhat), so the oxygen “leaps” to the hemoglobin in order to equalize the partial pressures across the chasm. But 5G radiation alters the porosity of cell membranes, allowing some molecules or ionic elements to move more easily across those members, displacing other molecules (or soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide) that might normally make that leap. For example, it is well documented that 5G radiation causes “Voltage Gated Ion Channels” (VGIC), specifically with calcium ions (VGCC), causing cellular toxicity due to too much calcium entering the cell walls and poisoning the cells.

The research on this was published in Environmental Research — here’s the link — and reveals that 5G exposure not only alters cell permeability (porosity), but also releases peroxinitrites in the body. These are inflammation-producing molecules that ravage other healthy molecules circulating in the blood. A thorough review of the available published science on wireless (WiFi) and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposure has identified at least seven different ways that WiFi and EMF microwave pollution actively harms the human body.

Published in the journal Environmental Research, the peer-reviewed paper explains that exposure to WiFi signals, which are everywhere these days, can lead to: oxidative stress, sperm and testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG (electroencephalogram) changes, apoptosis (programmed cell death), cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload. Note that coronavirus patients are already being observed with neuropsychiatric effects, testicular damage and oxidative stress, three of the symptoms of 5G exposure.

We just created this simple chart to point out the similarities between 5G exposure and coronavirus symptoms. Feel free to share everywhere, and link back to this article if possible:

We also know that 5G radiation and its effects on the cells of the body can lead to symptoms of insanity, hallucinations and even powerful personality changes. Interestingly, CNN’s Chris Cuomo already described bouts of hallucinations as he was battling the coronavirus, living in a high-5G city (NYC). As I wrote on Natural News last December:

5G radiation causes “neuropsychiatric” effects through a mechanism described as ion potentiation poisoning of brain cells, according to research published in Environmental Research.

This results in behavioral changes and even personality changes among those who are routinely exposed, researchers found. In other words, 5G is a weapon system that doubles as a telecommunications infrastructure, but the real impact is to damage human brain function and destroy rationality, reason and civility, especially among those who live in high population cities where 5G towers are becoming ubiquitous. That’s why you may have noticed increased insanity and widespread mental derangement in those areas. Part of this effect may also be due to the production of peroxynitrites, which are generated in the body’s cells upon exposure to the voltage emitted by 5G radiation, which is beamed at your body in a narrow cone of high-intensity energy. (5G antennae focus energy in a tight beam that follows you around.)

We are already observing the coronavirus causing psychiatric effects, including zombie-like violent, aggressive behavior such as deliberately spitting and coughing on people. How 5G radiation exposure alters the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen
Getting back to the oxygen question, the answer to why 5G radiation exposure may alter the function of hemoglobin is found in understanding the protein structure of hemoglobin itself.

Hemoglobin relies on something called the “heme group” which is a complex molecule with iron (FE 2+) in its center. This is surrounded by something called a “porphyrin ring” which is a cluster of unique structures (made of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen) that has a special affinity for other oxygen atoms. The ability for oxygen to “leap” onto this molecule in the lungs depends entirely on the structure (which also implies the ionic charges) of these complex molecules.

One thing to note in all this is that without the presence of histidine, a special protein, this heme group would have higher affinity toward carbon monoxide than oxygen, meaning the entire heme group would be occupied by carbon monoxide, blocking the absorption of oxygen. Thus, the histidine presence is critical for allowing the heme group to bind with oxygen. If you mess with histidine, you end up forcing hemoglobin to carry CO instead of O2, effectively creating oxygen deprivation in the blood.

This heme group, by the way, has special affinity for carbon dioxide, which allows the same molecule to carry CO2 out of the body’s cells and transport CO2 back to the lungs. Remember: The same hemoglobin molecule must carry both CO2 and O2 but at different times, and it must attract and then release those molecules at opposite times in order to rid the body of CO2 and nourish the body with O2. This is all accomplished with a delicate balance of proteins and protein folding.

The hemoglobin molecule itself is a miracle of Anonymousotechnology. It transmorphs into two different structural states based on whether it’s carrying oxygen or not. In what’s called the “R-state,” this molecule is like a magnet for oxygen. When four oxygen atoms are bound, it becomes a highly stable structure (and appears red). Technically, the binding of a single molecule of oxygen (O2) increases the affinity toward oxygen on the three other oxygen sites, making the hemoglobin “mop up” four oxygen molecules very quickly. When it lacks oxygen, it changes to a “T-state” and appears blue, which is why low-oxygen blood has a blue color. The important thing to understand in all this is that any alteration of the delicate structure of hemoglobin will impair its ability to bind with oxygen.

Take a look at the hemoglobin molecule representation above, from APSUbiology.org, and note the heme groups which are positioned in four places across the molecule. The polypeptide chains are part of the transmorphing structure of the molecule that allows it to carry and release both CO2 and O2, depending on the partial pressures of the gasses at different locations in the body (lungs vs. other cells). Note carefully that any change in the structure of hemoglobin will cause it to stop functioning:

Increasing the permeability of the hemoglobin molecule — i.e. its affinity toward other soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide — will “occupy” the hemoglobin molecule with the wrong substances, making it unable to absorb oxygen because it is not presenting in its “R-state” by the time the heart pumps the blood back to the lungs.

Stated another way, anything that significantly alters the affinity of hemoglobin toward other soluble gasses (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or even ionic minerals in the blood) could “shut off” the ability of blood to carry oxygen by altering its atomic structure.

If you change the structure of the heme group, it no longer functions to transport oxygen. Because in the case of the heme group, the structure is the function. Perhaps this can only be appreciated by organic chemists, but this heme group is truly a miracle of Anonymousotechnology.

Here’s a diagram of how iron, histidine, the heme group and O2 oxygen molecules interact with hemoglobin, which alters its structure depending on the “oxygenated” vs. “deoxygenated” forms: (via Biology.Kenyon.edu)

Can 5G exposure alter the structure of hemoglobin by increasing its affinity toward other molecules which are not O2?
The real question in all this is best phrased as I have asked it above. I doubt that we are dealing with a phenomenon where 5G radiation exposures blocks the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, but rather occupies the hemoglobin molecule with other elements that alter its structure and therefore its function, inhibiting its ability to bind with oxygen.

This is very likely happening all across the world wherever 5G is currently functioning, it’s just that the coronavirus is now exacerbating the symptoms and conditions to the point where mass death is occurring.

In other words, the coronavirus pandemic would likely not be nearly as bad if 5G exposure / radiation pollution wasn’t already compromising the structure and function of hemoglobin cells in the bodies of people who live in 5G cities.

This doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t real, of course; just that these two attacks on the human body have a synergistic effect of toxicity and mortality.

Conclusion: Humanity is committing suicide with 5G
While I strongly disagree with those who are claiming there’s no such thing as a virus or that the coronavirus is a hoax, I do agree that the widespread deployment of 5G antennas is a kind of suicide pact for the world.

Just as the Romans built their aqueducts out of lead linings and thereby poisoned their own citizens, driving them insane with load poisoning, the modern world of Big Tech and telecommunications is mass poisoning humanity with electropollution.

Right now, a lot of people are talking about the book, “The Invisible Rainbow” by John Kaminski, who believes coronavirus is an “electrical disease” and that 5G alone is causing all the mass deaths, not the virus. He writes things like, “The flu is not contagious” and “the quarantine is all a terrible hoax.”

Surely he is wrong on those claims, but he may not be wrong at all about the toxicity of electropollution and how 5G is actually a kind of “suicide system” that’s destroying humanity.

This all deserves a tremendous amount of additional study, but because we live in a world where Big Tech controls all the narratives and censors all those who question the safety of 5G, it now seems impossible for humanity to extricate itself from this mass suicide mission that has already been unleashed.

And that doesn’t even cover the topic of vaccines. What if Bill Gates’ vaccines are being deliberately engineered to contain toxic substances that 5G exposure will push into the cells, causing widespread death from “binary” exposure and subsequent cell toxicity?

It sure would be a simple way for Bill Gates to achieve his global depopulation dreams, all while administering a global IQ test that finds out which people are stupid enough to line up and be injected with a euthanasia weapon system.

178,"The hard evidence: USA is the source of Coronavirus!
",Osama Qadri," about where the “virus of the decade” has originated. This is published by the World’s most renown media most of which being affiliated to USA. While Covid-19 is spreading fast and wide all around the world, in China it has already declined. Due to its uncanny capabilities, China was able to control the spread of the virus. On the other hand, the whole world was busy finding means and techniques to contain it. In fact, most world prominent laboratories and pharmaceutical companies are working hard on monitoring and reviewing the results and researches of different centers including political statements of USA, UK, France, China and Russia to find out the source of this virus, whilst each country accuses others to be the source.   

What raises the contradiction is that USA has banned Chinese nationals and internationals who have travelled to China in the last 14 days from entering the US since February 2, in the aim of preventing the spread of the virus on a large scale. It was reported that the spread of the virus in USA has started since the shutdown of the bio-weapon Fort Detrick laboratory due to its failure and incapability to control the follicles of viruses and diseases. However, all data related to this laboratory were hidden and deleted from the Internet; nevertheless, the deleted data confirms the existence of coronavirus patients who hadn’t personally been to China or had been in contact with anyone who came from there. 

As for the scientific researchers conducted until now on the novel coronavirus, they all confirm that the virus was not made in a lab. A study published by “Nature” a prestigious scientific journal founded in 1869, shows that “the novel coronavirus is the 7th generation of coronaviruses that infect humans. Some of the most known generations of these viruses are the severe acute respiratory syndrome, the (SARS) outbreak of 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first reported in 2012.”  

A number of researchers in the fields of bacterial diseases, epidemics and immunology from American, British and Australian universities conducted this study which was later published on March 17, 2020. 

In a statement published on February 19 by the honorable medical journal “The Lancet”, established in 1823, a group of public health scientists warned against the spread of such false information. “We strongly condemn the conspiracy theories claiming that the New Coronavirus is not of a natural origin,” the statement said.  

Some accuse USA to be the first country where coronavirus has emerged whereas China is the country that discovered it. Other studies suggest that the USA has renewed, developed and used new generations of the virus under political and security orders.

It is not a coincidence that there are many scenarios which stress that China is the source of the virus. Certain scenarios consider it to be a biological weapon that escaped Chinese laboratories, while others claim that the source is Chinese food. The last fabrication was that it is caused by exposure to Sarin gas, pushing President Donald Trump to accuse China to be the source of the virus and then attack the World Health Organization (WHO). 

It was easy to promote the seafood market in Wuhan to be the source of the virus simultaneously when USA acknowledged what Robert Redfield, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared at a House Committee last Wednesday, that the diagnosis of some Americans who died from the flu revealed that they were in fact infected with the coronavirus.

Approaches and the follow-ups reveal that Chinese researchers have reached new results confirming that the outbreak of coronavirus was outside the market, specifically since the beginning of December 2019. Upon that, this event should be closely related to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian’s Tweet, in which he said “When did the disease appear in the USA? How many people were infected? What are the names of the hospitals? Maybe the US military brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Reveal your information! USA owes us an explanation.”

Based on this in addition to other facts, researchers concluded that the virus was transmitted from multiple sources to the seafood market. Afterwards, it started spreading widely due to the heavy transactions in the market between merchants and customers, and from the market to the whole city of Wuhan. 

The Senior Consultant of the Middle East Studies and Development Center Mr. Wael Yassine also confirmed that all facts and evidences verify that the spread of the virus started in China by the end of the Military World Games held in Wuhan in October 2019. Moreover, there are indications that the first coronavirus patient may have got infected from an already infected foreign person who came to China to participate in the military games. What’s most striking in this year’s games was that the American team did not win important medals as they used to, which raises the question whether or not the health status of the participants was the problem.  Taking a closer look, one of the participants, American officer Maatje Benassi, who was not feeling well and fell down at 2 kilometers away from the end of the race, said “Although I was feeling sick and extremely tired, but I insisted on coming to China and participating in the games.” It was later mentioned in the media that Maatje was infected with the virus but she had only registered her illness as flu. USA did not confirm the authenticity of this information or the fate of the officer.

The Red Devils have made Grealish one of their top targets. The 24-year-old has been the star in a Villa side that have struggled on their return to the Premier League this campaign. That has led United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to making Grealish one of his top targets this summer. The Red Devils are known to want to strengthen in midfield despite the arrival of Bruno Fernandes in January from Sporting Lisbon. The other options available to Solskjaer are Fred, Nemanja Matic, Scott McTominay and Andreas Pereira. JUST IN: Transfer news LIVE - Man Utd Â£100m double deal plan, Arsenal, Chelsea gossip  The future of Paul Pogba is still uncertain as he continues to be linked with a summer exit to Real Madrid or Juventus. Now the Mirror claim that United are so adamant they want Grealish, they would be willing to spend a massive Â£70m to land him. The club are also willing to treble the current Â£60,000-a-week wages of the Aston Villa star. Grealishâ€™s current contract runs until 2023 and has no buy-out clause meaning a huge transfer fee will be demanded by Dean Smithâ€™s side.

Grealish is also expected to be called up by England boss Gareth Southgate later this month if matches against Italy and Denmark go ahead. The games are in doubt though due to the coronavirus crisis across the world. United are long-term admirers of Grealish and see this summer as the perfect time to finally get their man and strengthen a key area of the team.  He would also join the likes of Marcus Rashford, Harry Maguire and Dean Henderson who would all be possible England team-mates in the future. Villa are currently 19th in the Premier League after being hammered 4-0 by Leicester last night. And manager Dean Smith accepts staying in the top flight will be key to the club having any chance of keeping Grealish beyond the summer. â€œStaying in this league is probably one of the biggest things that will help us to keep Jack Grealish,â€ he said. â€œHe wants to play at the highest level and win trophies.â€ Villaâ€™s next match is against Frank Lampardâ€™s Chelsea who are chasing Champions League qualification.

But Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer hit back, and said ""let's have an adult conversation about this"". Mr Pym asked: ""Can you comment on the reports today that supplies of PPE were allowed to run down in the couple of years before the pandemic and why was more not done to get hold of more PPE in March and early February?"" The Education Secretary responded first and said there has been an ""enormous national effort"" to secure PPE from right around the globe. He continued: """"But you know, the government, from the first moment that we were in a situation where the scientific advice was highlighting to us that we were facing a real challenge in terms of coronavirus, and this could potentially evolve into a pandemic, every resource of government has been deployed to not just expanding what we need in terms of PPE, but also ventilators, and we've seen a massive growth in the number of ventilators that we have available in our hospitals. ""And keep adding and building to the stock of what we've got.""  Please sign up to pledge your support now to our brave NHS Heroes   She said: ""So I think we need to step back a little bit and start from the beginning of this which is the UK, regardless of the position that we may be in now, has been an international exemplar in preparedness. ""So the fact that there is a pandemic influenza stockpile is considered a very high quality mark of a prepared country in international terms. ""What we have had is a huge demand on our supply and I think we have had if I might say from my own professional perspective, we could perhaps have a more adult and more detailed conversation about PPE supplies."" She added: ""It is important to remember that although there may be elements of distribution problems across the UK at different times and at different places this is a huge pull on services which we have never seen before.

The Government has faced heavy criticism for its lack of PPE equipment, as frontline NHS staff were told on Friday they may have to reuse disposable PPE or seek alternative clothing if they run out of supplies. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick aimed to dispel the criticism yesterday, when he announced a shipment of 84tonnes of PPE was on its way to frontline workers. He said: ""Supply in some areas, particularly gowns and certain types of masks and aprons, is in short supply at the moment and that must be an extremely anxious time for people working on the front line.

But the shipment, meant to be arriving from Turkey, was delayed on Sunday. A Government spokeswoman said: ""We are continuing to work to ensure the shipment is delivered as soon as possible."" On the PPE shortages, Chris Hopson, Chief Executive of NHS Providers, said: â€œNo-one in the NHS wanted to be where we now are on gowns, with a significant number of trusts reporting critically low stocks.  â€œWe have, over the last 24 hours, seen an unhelpful focus on one individual consignment coming from Turkey. We are told that this consignment is still stuck in Turkey with no certainty, at the time this comment was issued, on how many gowns, if any, will leave for the UK, when."" He added: â€œOn the current position in trusts, it is important to understand what â€˜running out of gownsâ€™ means.

467,Carol Ann Duffy leads British poets creating 'living record' of coronavirus | Books | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alisonflood,"Carol Ann Duffy has launched an international poetry project with major names including Imtiaz Dharker, Roger McGough and Ian McMillan, as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. The former poet laureate hopes the project, entitled Write Where We Are Now, â€œwill provide an opportunity for reflection and inspiration in these challenging times, as well as creating a living record of what is happening as seen through our poetsâ€™ eyes and ears, in their gardens or garretsâ€. Hands, Duffyâ€™s poem, was written on 26 March and sees the author reflecting on how every Thursday, â€œwe clap at the darknessâ€, and on how she can see the hands of her absent daughter â€œwhen I put my head in my ownâ€. Another contribution from the Scottish poet takes a fiercer tone: Since You Ask sees her â€œScunnered, stymied, shafted, shaded, / shat on from a great height, spaffed, spooked.â€ It ends: â€œOK, OK, OK. Onwards.â€ We clap at the darkness.I hearken for the soundof my daughterâ€™s small hands,but she is miles away...though I can see her handswhen I put my head in my own. In Andrew McMillanâ€™s Garden, he writes of how at first the dead â€œwere few / enough to name them / but soon they grew too many / the vast fields of themâ€. Duffy is spearheading the project with the Manchester Writing School at Manchester Metropolitan University. Contributors range from new and emerging poets to award-winners Raymond Antrobus and Andrew McMillan, and some of British poetryâ€™s biggest names, such as Gillian Clarke and Jackie Kay. â€œWe need the voice of poetry in times of change and world-grief. A poem only seeks to add to the world and now seems the time to give,â€ said Duffy, who is creative director of the writing school. In Cranes Lean In, Dharker writes of a phone call with her daughter while she looks over a London in lockdown: â€œPetals brush my face. / You say at last // the cherry blossom / has arrived // as if that is what / we were really waiting for.â€ She wrote it, she said, â€œstanding at a window looking out over the marooned city. London had stopped its eternal building and the streets and stations were becalmed.â€ â€œThat was the day it suddenly came home to many mothers what this meant, this strange waiting time without their children,â€ Dharker went on. â€œI could hear the phone calls all over the world, people separated and searching for words of hope and consolation to give each other. The words my daughter gave me were about kindnesses, and something we had both been waiting for: the cherry trees blossoming in the parks and streets of London.â€ Cranes lean in, waiting for an all-clearthat will not come. Forehead pressed to glass,phone at my ear, I learn to sail on your voiceover a sadness of building sites, past Kingâ€™s Cross, St Pancras,to the place where you are. You say nothingis too far, mothers will find their daughters,strangers will be neighbours, even saviourswill have names. You are all flamein a red dress. Petals brush my face.You say at last the cherry blossomhas arrived as if that is whatwe were really waiting for. McMillan, winner of the 2015 Guardian first book award and a contributor alongside his father, Ian, said it was â€œreally important to record as a continuing historical document the times weâ€™re living throughâ€. â€œIâ€™ve always believed a poetâ€™s job is to be a witness, and this is just another example of that,â€ said McMillan, who said he had found it very hard to write his poem. â€œThere are some things which feel beyond language â€“ huge numbers of deaths, untold suffering, unmanageable fear. Weâ€™re dealing with abstracts and the first instinct within that is to reach for abstracts ourselves, but abstracts donâ€™t make for good poetry,â€ he said. â€œAll I tried to do, and all I think any of us can do, is focus on something small and contained and concrete, and try to tell it that way.â€ In Unbecoming Maramot, Romalyn Ante, an award-winning poet who works as an NHS nurse, writes after a shift: â€œShe walks an unlit road on her own, yet not alone. / Look at her now â€“ night after night, shift after shift.â€ TS Eliot-winning poet George Szirtes is writing a new poem every day for the project, while Moira Egan and David Tait are writing from lockdown in Italy and China respectively. Prof Malcolm Press, vice-chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan University, called the initiative inspiring. â€œI am sure that these outstanding poems will voice the sentiments and feelings that many of us around the world will share,â€ he said. â€œAt the same time, I am confident that these innovative and imaginative works will inspire creativity and hope.â€",0,
324,"U.S. senators propose $500 billion rescue for state, local governments - Reuters",,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate Republican and a Democrat proposed a $500 billion rescue package for state and municipal governments on Monday, as it became increasingly clear that the next coronavirus relief bill will not include money for reeling local authorities. â€œThe current bill coming out will not have this aid, or any aid, for states and municipalities. It kind of makes sense, though, because we donâ€™t yet know what the toll is,â€ Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said on a conference call with journalists. Cassidy, of Louisiana, and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, who represent two of the states hit hardest by the pandemic, said their bill would allocate money based on statesâ€™ populations, infection rates and revenue losses in order to ensure that money goes where it is needed most. The two senators discussed their proposed legislation as Democrats and Republicans worked on details of a possible $450 billion-plus deal to provide more aid to small businesses and hospitals hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. State governors and local officials across the United States have been pleading for more federal aid to provide essential services, as Americans stay home and businesses have closed because of the coronavirus outbreak. Congressional leaders said they could vote on the latest bill, which would follow a $2.3 trillion aid package passed in March, as soon as this week. Cassidy and Menendez said they hoped their bipartisan bill could provide a framework for what they dubbed â€œCovid 4,â€ a subsequent tranche of coronavirus aid. COVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by the coronavirus. â€œCovid 3.5 (the current bill) is more focused on business and hospitals, primary, and testing,â€ Menendez said. â€œWe think this is well poised for what I believe will be a Covid 4.â€ Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; editing by Jonathan Oatis",0,
268,Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caught Trying to Include Abortion Funding in Bill to Combat Coronavirus,STEVEN ERTELT,"Speaker Nancy Pelosi is so dedicated to promoting abortion and forcing Americans to fund killing babies in abortion that she has been caught trying to add taxpayer financing of abortions to the bill to combat the Coronavirus and provide economic stimulus to the nation as it deals with the COVD-19 outbreak.
Nancy Pelosi has a long history of promoting abortion and her first act after becoming Speaker in 2019 was pushing legislation to use tax money for abortions. So it’s no surprise she is trying to exploit the Coronavirus pandemic to push abortion funding again.
As The Daily Caller reports:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to include a potential way to guarantee federal funding for abortion into the coronavirus economic stimulus plan, according to multiple senior White House officials.
Speaking to the Daily Caller, those officials alleged that while negotiating the stimulus with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi tried to lobby for “several” provisions that stalled bipartisan commitment to the effort. One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.",1,
31,First volunteer in UK coronavirus vaccine trial has died,James Alami,"Elisa Granato, the first volunteer who availed herself in Oxford for a jab in the first Europe human trial of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus pandemic has died. She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated. A statement by the researchers said Elisa had complications few hours after taking the vaccine and died while on admission. Elisa Granato, who is a scientist, was one of the two who received the jab. Four other volunteer are said to be battling complications due to adverse reactions of the vaccine. Officials say the four persons are being monitored against any adverse effects of the vaccine. After taking her shot, Elisa Granato told the BBC: “I’m a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can.” Researchers who are awaiting for an autopsy to be conducted believe the Elisa had an underlying health condition which was not disclosed to health officials. “The four in critical conditions will be fine and these are expected reactions from the vaccines, hence a trial.” the researchers revealed and added that these observations would help improve on the vaccine before it becomes available for use by the public.",1,
28,Coronavirus not natural – Nobel Prize winning Professor of Medicine,Demola Abimboye,"Dr Tasuku Honjo, 2018 Nobel Prize winning Professor of Medicine, has said that the Coronavirus is not natural but manufactured by China at a laboratory in Wuhan. His words: “If it is natural, it wouldn’t have adversely affected the entire world like this. Because, as per nature, temperature is different in different countries. If it is natural, it would adversely affect only those countries having the same temperature as China. “Instead, it is spreading in a country like Switzerland, in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. Whereas if it were natural, it would have spread in cold places, but died in hot places. “I have done 40 years of research on animals and viruses. It is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. “I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory. I have been phoning them all, after the Coronavirus surfaced. But all their phones are dead for the last 3 months. It is now understood that all these lab technicians have died. “Based on all my knowledge and research till date, I can say this with 100% confidence – That the Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it. “If what I am saying today is proved false now or even after my death, the government can withdraw my Nobel Prize. China is lying and this truth will one day be revealed to everyone. According to Wikipedia, Tasuku Honjo born January 27, 1942 is a Japanese physician-scientist and immunologist. He shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology and is best known for his identification of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). He is also known for his molecular identification of cytokines: IL-4 and IL-5, as well as the discovery of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) that is essential for class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. He was elected as a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences, USA (2001), as a member of German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina (2003), and also as a member of the Japan Academy (2005). In 2018, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with James P. Allison. He and Allison together had won the 2014 Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science for the same achievement. He completed his M.D. degree in 1966 from the Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, where in 1975 he received his Ph.D. degree in Medical Chemistry under the supervision of Yasutomi Nishizuka and Osamu Hayaishi. Honjo was a visiting fellow at the Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution of Washington, from 1971 to 1973. He then moved to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he studied the genetic basis for the immune response at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as a fellow between 1973 and 1977, followed by many years as an NIH Fogarty Scholar in Residence starting in 1992. During part of this time, Honjo also was an assistant professor at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, between 1974 and 1979; a professor in the Department of Genetics, Osaka University School of Medicine, between 1979 and 1984; and professor in the Department of Medical Chemistry, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, from 1984 to 2005.

He was 80 years old and leaves behind many children and grandchildren. He will long be remembered as a television icon, champion of education, learning, and family values. It is a little-known fact that Alex Trebek was a lifelong Republican and a fervent Trump supporter. In his last will and testament, he even left behind his estate to the Trump campaign as he said: “it is the best thing I can do for the future of my grandchildren.” The estate is estimated to be valued at 100 million dollars and will be used to win in November. Friend of Trebek, Senator Joe Barron, said that Alex Trebek will always be remembered as being a generous soul that would do anything to help someone in need. “Yeah, no one really knew he was a conservative. They just assumed because he was on that smart person show in TV he had to be a liberal. But since facts don’t matter and none of this is real to me, he’s a Republican and therefore a good man that would help anyone in need. He will be missed and we are glad he left his estate to a worthy cause.” It is a sad day to lose such a great man, but we must look at the bright side of the great life he lived, and most importantly, the fortune he is leaving behind to benefit future generations by supporting Donald Trump. Rest in peace, good sir. You’ve certainly earned it.",1,
140,Ukraine’s Opposition Accuses US of Scrubbing Info About Biolabs’ Activities on Ukrainian Territory,Anonymous,"The US Embassy in Kiev has been caught in the center of a brewing political scandal after denying allegations about US biological laboratories’ “unlawful activity” in Ukraine, while admitting that such labs do exist.

The US Embassy in Kiev has scrubbed information about the work of two of its biolabs in Ukraine from its website, Viktor Medvedchuk, co-leader of the Opposition Platform – For Life party, has alleged.

According to the lawmaker, in its April 22 statement responding to Rada lawmakers’ mid-April request for a government investigation into the 15 US biolabs operating on Ukrainian territory, the US Embassy provided a link to an explanation about the operation of its ‘Biological Threat Reduction Program’. There are two interesting facts associated with the document, Medvedchuk alleges – first, that the webpage was created on April 9, 2020, three days before lawmakers made their request for a government inquiry, and second, that there are discrepancies between the English and Ukrainian versions of the pages.

“The Ukrainian-language document appeared earlier, but in 2017 featured another version of the document, now deleted, including the text ‘Consolidation of particularly hazardous pathogens in modern biosafety level facilities (one level three biosafety lab for human pathogens and one level three biosafety lab for animal pathogens)’,” Medvedchuk explained in a statement Monday.
“In other words, in 2017, the US Embassy not only openly curated at least two level three biolabs, but openly stated this. This is not proof that there have not been other, more dangerous laboratories, or that these laboratories have not conducted experiments with pathogens presenting the maximum level of danger, but it does indicate a desire by the US Embassy to remove information that compromises them,” Medvedchuk claimed. Ukraine’s Opposition Platform – For Life requested a government probe into the operation of US biolabs in Ukraine on April 15, claiming that since these labs’ deployment, Ukraine has faced mysterious outbreaks of otherwise inexplicable dangerous diseases, such as the 2009 outbreak of hemorrhagic pneumonia, the 2011, 2014 and 2015 cholera outbreaks, and an outbreak of hepatitis A in 2017. In early 2016, at least 20 Ukrainian servicemen were reported to have died from a flu-like virus, with 364 more people succumbing to swine flu months later. “The Ukrainian people have the right to know about secret programs,” the opposition lawmakers’ appeal stressed.

In its April 22 reply, the US Embassy accused Opposition Platform MPs of spreading “disinformation,” while admitting that a Department of Defence Biological Threat Reduction Program is working “with the Ukrainian Government to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern in Ukrainian government facilities.” In his comments Monday, Medvedchuk suggested that the alleged creation of a separate level 3 lab for human pathogens may indicate experimentation on human beings. “This is the main reason for the creation of US biolabs in Ukraine, serving as an opportunity to carry out the most dangerous kinds of studies, including studies on human beings, which are prohibited under US laws, but allowed in Ukraine, due to problems in Ukrainian legislation, but to a greater extent, to Ukraine’s foreign control by the United States,” he claimed.
Shady US Labs Across Post-Soviet Space
The Ukrainian lawmakers’ allegations aren’t the first of their kind. In 2018, Georgia’s former minister of state security asked President Trump to investigate reports that personnel from the US’s Lugar Center biological lab outside Tbilisi had engaged in experimentation on live human test subjects.

In September 2018, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it had its suspicions about possible US testing of biological weapons in states near Russia’s borders, and warned Washington to halt such activities immediately. In March, Iranian doctors penned a letter to the leaders of Afghanistan, Georgia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan to destroy all US biololabs in their countries, claiming that the coronavirus pandemic may have been spread deliberately as a form of biological warfare.

Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned Washington that Russia was apprised of US efforts to expand military research at the Lugar Lab, and said that the US has substantially expanded dual purpose biological research at labs across the former Soviet space under the pretext of combating bioterrorism.",1,

135,MAINSTREAM NARRATIVE CENSORS ANY ATTEMPTS TO CONTAIN HYSTERIA OVER COVID-19,Anonymous,"Dr. Didier Raoult, the famous French infectious disease specialist, creator and director of the Mediterranean University-Clinical Institute of Infectious Diseases, used it for treatment.

The results of Dr. Raoult and his institute were outstanding: by the end of March, only 10 of the 2,400 people who received treatment at his institute had died.

But, as soon as Trump said it would work, the medication suddenly became worthless and unusable.

Nevada Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak immediately banned the use of chloroquine for treating COVID-19 with his order, while Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer threatened doctors who used the medication with administrative sanctions.

As for Dr. Raoult – he was immediately accused of quackery, totalitarianism, and sexual harassment. But to be fair, he said that universal testing was needed and that both choloroquine and azithromycin should be used in the early stages of the disease, and then it was useless to apply them later on.

As such, Raoult may have not found the be-all end-all of COVID-19 treatments, but rather found that’s needed – proper testing.

Then, the above-mentioned governor’s orders were immediately supported by other studies, claiming that the medication shouldn’t be used.

A group of scientists analyzed the medical history of COVID-19 patients in a hospital for American veterans and published a terrifying preprint. 28% of those who received chloroquine died, and among those who did not, only 11% died. And then, the medication from not-very-effective in the later stages, turned into something that kills patients.

The thing is that no information was given about the study that’s being propagated, at least Raoult provided some evidence.

An additional adverse effect of this study was that chloroquine has been consumed for over 80 years. This is the oldest and well-proven cure for malaria. It is produced in tons. Its wholesale price for Africa is 4 (in words – four) cents. It is included in the WHO list of essential medicines, which includes only the safest and most needed medicines. And it claimed that it kills people.

For 80 years, chloroquine has been a cheap, common, safe generic. And only when it turned out that the medicine was priced at 4 cents, it was established that it couldn’t cure COVID-19 because it would potentially be too cheap and accessible.

Another promising drug was remdesivir, an Ebola drug developed by Gilead Sciences. And what? On April 23rd, WHO “accidentally” posted on its website test results that showed that remdesivir was no good.

The tests were carried out so incorrectly that WHO had to immediately remove the article from the site and even claim that it got there “by mistake”.

But the deed was done. Gilead shares crashed. Explanations by its scientists that the WHO-provided clinical trials were incorrect, did not interest anyone.

Media informed the whole world that the drug did not work in the “gold standard” trials, and the trials themselves had to be interrupted due to side effects.

The trick of all these stories is that trials by all medical rules – double blind randomized – cannot be done at all in an epidemic. And to conduct them is immoral. During the epidemic, the doctor will not leave a whole group of patients without a medicine that, he thinks, can help them, only to check if this medicine works.

At the same time, the epidemic removed barriers to the quality of information – and articles and preprints began to appear on professional websites that would never have been reviewed.

It’s a Catch-22 situation: any positive news wouldn’t be taken into account because didn’t pass the “double-blind randomized test” while negative news would be immediately shared, because in an epidemic you want to get to the most audience, and it’s easier to believe fearmongering, since the climate itself facilitates it.

And it is possible that the vaccine testing would undergo the same treatment.

Many “live” vaccines tend to stimulate the innate immune system and thereby protect not only from the disease from which the vaccine works, but also from a wide range of infections in general.

The stimulation mechanism is sufficiently proven and studied.

Especially remarkable in this sense is not even the BCG vaccine, but the live polio vaccine, which has been used for a long time in developing countries, where it not only protected against poliomyelitis, but also reduced infant mortality from other infections by 30%.

In the USSR, the same vaccine reduced the incidence of influenza by 75%.

This live vaccine, perhaps, could serve as a serious defense throughout, for example, the year and a half, during which the vaccine itself against the virus is being developed. The vaccine costs 10 cents.

The famous virologist and founder of the Global Virus Network, Dr. Robert Gallo, best known for his discovery of HIV, announced the start of clinical trials of the polio vaccine against COVID-19.

A vaccine that is already ready, which costs 10 cents, which will radically reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, and there are no side effects from it (in children – one case in three million, despite what the anti-vaxxers say).

WHO – rightly – stated that it does not recommend the use of a live polio vaccine against coronavirus.

As the number of antibody tests grew and it became clear that 20-25% of the population was already infected in New York. And there was a danger, of people returning to the streets.

And on April 24th, the WHO stated that it is categorically against lifting quarantine for those who have been ill, because it has “no data” that all people develop stable immunity. In some patients, WHO warns, antibody levels are very low, and tests can give a false-positive result. Therefore, even those who have been ill cannot go to work.

So, does that mean that vaccination also doesn’t work? If, according to WHO, even after an illness there is no guarantee that antibodies will be produced, how will they be produced after vaccination?

That is, the recommendation by WHO is translated like this: There is no cure for this disease. That is, the WHO, of course, did not check, but there are a couple of preprints saying that there’s no cure, and it cannot ignore such important evidence.

Basically, people should sit at home and, more importantly, generally keep quiet.

If people want to work so as not to starve to death, just call them a fascist.

If they raise the question that people without work will get drunk, get on drugs, commit suicide, just call them a fascist, covidiot.

If they attempt to timidly stutter that closed hospitals will lead to a monstrous increase in mortality from cancer, from cardiovascular diseases, from diseases of the kidneys, liver, once again, just call them a fascist and covidiot.

This isn’t to say that COVID-19 is not a serious pandemic. It is an astounding test of the strength healthcare systems, as seen in France and Italy, which occupy the 1st and 2nd position in the WHO ranking, and of the US, which occupies the 37th position.

And Italy and France appear to be passing the test, while the US seems to be failing entirely.

All of the listed above paints a very stark picture. This is no longer an attempt to solve a real problem, but rather an attempt to make the problem unsolvable, and the control and power of the bureaucrats is eternal.",1,
134,Corona Tyranny – and Death by Famine,Peter Koenig,"By the end of 2020 more people will have died from hunger, despair and suicide than from the corona disease. We, the world, is facing a famine-pandemic of biblical proportions. This real pandemic will overtake the COVID19 pandemic by a long shot. The hunger pandemic reminds of the movie the Hunger Games, as it is premised on similar circumstances of a domiAnonymoust few commanding who can eat and who will die – by competition.

This hunger pandemic will be under-reported or not reported at all in the mainstream media. In fact, it has started already. In the west the attention focuses on the chaos created by the privatized for-profit mismanagement of the health system. It slowly brings to light the gross manipulation in the US of COVID-19 infections and death rates – how hospitals are encouraged to declare deaths as COVID19-deaths – for every COVID19 death-certificate the hospital receives a US$13,000 “subsidy”, and if the patient dies on a ventilator, the “bonus” amounts to US$ 39,000.

In real life, poor people cannot live under confinement, under lockdown. Not only have many or most already lost their meager living quarters because they can no longer pay the rent – but they need to scrape together in the outside world whatever they can find to feed their families and themselves. They have to go out and work for food and if there is no work, no income – they may resort to ransacking supermarkets in the city or farms in the country side. Food to sustain life is essential. Taking the opportunity to buy food away from people is sheer and outright murder.

“Every child who dies from famine in the world – is a murder” – Jean Ziegler, former UN-Rapporteur on Food in Africa.

Yes, the diabolical Masters of Darkness, who invented and launched this COVID19 pandemic –are nothing less than murderers. Mass-murderers, that is. They are committing mass genocide on a worldwide scale in proportions unknown in recent history of human kind. And this to dominate a world under a New World Order, aiming at a massively reduced world population.

The self-imposed new rulers decide who will live and who will die. Their self-promoting do-gooder agenda – à la Bill Gates and Co. – professes to reduce world poverty – yes, by killing the poor, by, for example, tainted toxic vaccinations, rendering African women infertile. (The Gates Foundation with support of WHO and UNICEF have a track record of doing so in Kenya and elsewhere, see here  Kenya carried out a massive tetanus vaccination program, sponsored by WHO and UNICEF); or letting the “under-developed”, the already destitute, die by famine – preventing them from access to sufficient food and drinking water. Privatizing water, privatizing even emergency food supplies – is a crime that leads exactly to this: lack of access due to unaffordable pricing.

Should this not be enough, “Lock Step” has other solutions to enhance starvation. HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) can help. HAARP has been perfected and weaponized. According to US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report, weather modification can be used defensively and offensively, i.e. to create droughts or floods, both of which have the potential of destroying crops – destroying the livelihood of the poor.

And if that is not enough, the 2010 Rockefeller Report also foresees food rationing, selectively, of course, as we are talking about eugenics. Let’s not forget Henry Kissinger’s infamous words he uttered in 1970: “Who controls the food supply controls the people – the quote goes on saying, “Who controls the energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control the world.”

A recent Facebook entry (name and location not revealed for personal protection) reads as follows:

“….. In the poorer country, where I live, the entire village is on lockdown since March 16. Here the people having nothing to eat…… The wife of my main worker was raped and beaten to death. She was of Chinese descent. In spite of not being allowed to go outside, the people were starving and rampaged walking miles from farm to farm destroying everything. I have lost my entire livestock, fruits, vegetables. The houses were burned and the vehicles, tools etc. stolen. I am bankrupt with nobody around who can give money to rebuild. My workers cannot be paid. Their families are also starving. More malnutrition and undernourishment which will lead to a higher starvation rate or death from other diseases. How many will commit suicide through landing on the streets completely impoverished? – How many died in India trying to walk literally up to thousands of miles to get back home in the hope of finding refuge, after all public transportation was shut down and all had to go into lockdown. I am sure that these numbers will be a lot higher than the number who have died from the virus as well as will increase the numbers for those dying of next year’s flue due to a weakened immune system.”

And as an afterthought …. “Maybe the elite are planning depopulation. It sure looks like it.”

This happened somewhere in the Global South. But the example is representative for much of the Global South, and developing countries in general. And probably much worse is to come, as we are seeing so far only a tiny tip of the iceberg.

The International Labor Organization (ILO) reports that worldwide unemployment is reaching never-seen mammoth proportions, that about half of the world’s workforce – 1.6 billion people -may be out of work. That means no income to pay for shelter, food, medication – it means starvation and death. For millions. Especially in the Global South which has basically no social safety nets. People are left to themselves.

The New York Times (NYT) reports (1 May 2020) that in the US millions of unemployed go uncounted, as the system cannot cope with the influx of claims. Add these millions to the already reported more than 27 million unemployed, the tally becomes astronomical. The same NYT concludes that the millions who have risen out of poverty since the turn of the century, are likely to fall back into destitution along with millions more.

Dying of famine – mostly in the Global South, but not exclusively – is an atrocious death for millions, maybe hundreds of millions. Dying in the gutters of mega-cities, forgotten by society, by the authorities, too weak to even beg, infested with parasites due to lack of hygiene – rotting away alive. This is already happening today in many metropolises, even without the corona disaster. These people are not picked up by any statistics. They are non-people. Period.

Imagine – such situations in large cities as well as in rural areas, under plan “Lock Step” (Rockefeller, Kissinger, Gates et al), the death toll would be orders of magnitude higher.

The current lockdown – brings everything to halt. Practically worldwide. The longer it lasts the more devastating the social and economic impact will be. Irretrievable. Not only production of goods, services and food – comes to a halt, but vital supply chains to bring products from a to A to B, are interrupted. Workers are not allowed to work. Security. For your own protection. The virus, the invisible enemy could hit you. It could kill you – and your loved-ones too. Fear-Fear-Fear – that’s the moto that works best – it works so well that people start screaming – gimmi, gimmi, gimmi- gimmi a vaccine! – which brings a happy grin on Bill Gates’ face. As he sees the billions rolling and his power rising.

Bill Gates along with WHO he bought will become famous. They will save the world from new pandemics – never mind, their side effects – 7 billion people vaccinated (Bill Gates’ wet dream) and nobody has time to care or report about side effects, no matter how deadly they may be. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) may be slated for the Peace Nobel Prize – and, who knows, Bill Gates may become one of the next Presidents of the dying empire. Wouldn’t that be an appropriate reward for the world?

Meanwhile the rather cold-blooded IMF maintains its awfully unrealistic prediction of a slight “economic contraction” of the world economy of a mere 3% in 2020, and a slight growth in the second half of 2021. The IMF’s approach to world economics and human development – to social crisis, is fully monetized and lacks any compassion – and thus, becomes utterly irrelevant in the age of corona. Institutions like the IMF and the World Bank, mere extension of the US treasury, they are passé in the face of an economic collapse, for which they are also in part responsible.

What they should do – perhaps IMF and WB combined – is call for a capital increase of up to 4 trillion SDRs (as was suggested by some of the IMF Board Members) and use the funds as a special debt relieve fund, a “Debt Jubilee Fund” for Global South Nations. Handed out as grants. This would allow these nations to get back on their feet, back to their sovereign national monetary and economic policies, recovering their internal economy, with a national currency, public banking and a government-owned central bank, creating jobs and internal autonomy in food, health and education.

Why is this not happening? – It would require a change in their constitution and a redistribution of voting rights according to new economic strength of nations. China would become a much more important player – with a more important share and decision-making role. Of course, that’s what the US does not want to happen. But the unwillingness to adapt to new realities, makes these institutions irrelevant to the point that they should and might fade away.

Interestingly, though, two of the three economic projection scenarios of the IMF, foresee another pandemic, or a new wave of the old pandemic in 2021. What does the IMF know that we don’t?

Juxtaposed to the insensitive approach of the global fiAnonymouscial institutions and the globalized private banking system, the World Food Program warns (25 April 2020) that the COVID19 pandemic will cause “famines of biblical proportions”; that without urgent action and funding, hundreds of millions of people will face starvation and millions could die as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As it is, every year about 9 million people die from famine in the world.

The WFP Executive Director, David Beasley, told the UN Security Council that in addition to the threat to health posed by the virus, the world faces “multiple famines within a few short months,” which could result in 300,000 deaths per day—a “hunger pandemic.”

Beasley added that even before the outbreak, the world was “facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II” this year due to many factors. He cited the wars in Syria and Yemen, the crisis in South Sudan and locust swarms across East Africa. He said that coupled with the coronavirus outbreak, famine threatened about three dozen nations.

According to the WFP’s “2020 Global Report on Food Crises” released Monday (20 April ), 135 million people around the world were already threatened with starvation. Beasley said that as the virus spreads, “an additional 130 million people could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020. That’s a total of 265 million people.”

The famine pandemic is further exacerbated by the ongoing refugee crisis – which is also a catastrophe of misery – hunger, disease, lack of shelter – total lack of hygiene in most of the refugee camps.

Professor Jean Ziegler, Sociologist (Universities Geneva and Sorbonne, Paris), Vice-President of the UN Human Rights Committee, recently visited the refugee camp of Moria on the Greek island of Lesbos. He described a situation where 24,000 refugees are cramped into military barracks that were built for 2,800 soldiers, live under calamitous circumstances – lack of potable water, insufficient and often inedible food, clogged and much too few stinking toilets…. diseases no end. COVID19 would just be a sideline.

These people who fled Europe-and-western-caused warzones, destroyed livelihoods – are being pushed back by the very European Union, as most countries do not want to host them and give them a chance for a new life. This atrocious xenophobic behavior of Europe is against Human Rights all EU countries signed and against internal EU rules. They are a sad reminder of what Europe really is – a conglomerate of countries with a history of hundreds of years of colonization, of merciless exploitation, plundering and raping of the Global South.

This abjectly atrocious characteristic – shamelessly continuing to this day – seems to have become an integral part of the European DNA. These wars and conflicts are willfully US-NATO made, for power, greed – to maintain the US military industrial complex alive and profitable – and as a stepping stone towards total world hegemony.

The refugees emanating from these conflict zones, their fate and famine will be added to those starving form the also man-imposed corona crisis. The death toll from sheer hunger and famine-related causes, may become astronomical by the end of 2020, way-way outweighing and dwarfing the doctored and manipulated COVID-19 figures.

My final words: follow you heart. Open your heart to love and beyond your five given and media-manipulated senses and enter a higher consciousness. Get out of FEAR, get out of the lockdown, stand up for your rights, for your freedom. Because freedom and liberty cannot be bought with money, nor trampled by the media. They are inherently within us all. If enough of us open our hearts to LOVE, to an all-englobing love, we will overcome this small psychopathic elite.",1,
434,Home gardening blooms around the world during coronavirus lockdowns - Reuters,"Christopher Walljasper, Tom Polansek","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Jaime Calder all but gave up on gardening after moving from the fertile soils of Illinois to dusty Texas, but the coronavirus changed her mind. The magazine editor and her family of five planted collard greens, chard, onions, blackberries, watermelons and peppers this year, expanding their garden while buckling down at home during the pandemic. People around the world are turning to gardening as a soothing, family friendly hobby that also eases concerns over food security as lockdowns slow the harvesting and distribution of some crops. Fruit and vegetable seed sales are jumping worldwide. â€œItâ€™s supplementary gardening,â€ said Calder. â€œThereâ€™s no way this would sustain a family of five. But weâ€™re amping it up, so we can try and avoid the store a little more in the coming months.â€ Russians are isolating in out-of-town cottages with plots of land, a traditional source of vegetables during tough times since the Soviet era, and rooftop farms are planned in Singapore, which relies heavily on food imports. Furloughed workers and people working from home are also looking for activities to occupy their free time, after the cancellations of major sporting events and the closure of restaurants, bars and theaters. Parents too are turning to gardening as an outdoor activity to do with children stuck at home after schools shut. â€œPlanting a few potatoes can be quite a revelation to a child,â€ said Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at Britainâ€™s Royal Horticultural Society, which has seen a five-fold rise in queries for advice on its website during the lockdown. Gardeners without yards are even planting potatoes in trash bags, he said. Gardening could trim retail demand for produce but trips to the grocery store will still be necessary. Bert Hambleton, retail consultant for Hambleton Resources, said supermarkets will continue to see an overall increase in produce demand as would-be restaurant-goers eat at home instead of dining out. U.S. seed company W. Atlee Burpee & Co sold more seed than any time in its 144-year history in March as the contagious respiratory virus spread, Chairman George Ball said. When they cannot find seeds in stores, would-be gardeners in Britain are seeking advice on how to extract them from tomatoes and squash purchased in supermarkets, Barter said. In Russia, demand for seeds rose by 20%-30% year-on-year in March, according to online retailer Ozon. Seed demand typically goes up in tough economic times, said Tom Johns, owner of Territorial Seed Company in Cottage Grove, Oregon. The company temporarily stopped taking orders over the phone due to a surge in demand and reassigned some phone workers to physically fill online orders, he said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t take long for people to become very concerned about the food supply - either the cost of food or getting food,â€ Johns said. Johnnyâ€™s Selected Seeds in Fairfield, Maine, saw a 270% jump in orders the week of March 16, after U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus. Canada-based Stokes Seeds, which ships to the United States and Canada, received 1,000 online orders during the weekend of March 21, four times more than normal, President Wayne Gayle said. â€œWe didnâ€™t have the staff even just to enter them into the system, let alone fulfill them,â€ he said. The company temporarily halted all online orders and is prioritizing orders from commercial vegetable growers â€œto ensure our food security this summer,â€ according to its website. With so many digging into gardening for the first time, there has also been a push to pool resources and collective knowledge on home food production. Nathan Kleinman, co-director of Philadelphia-based Experimental Farm Network, said more than 2,000 people signed up and attended weekly calls to discuss gardening best practices as they begin putting seeds in the ground. â€œThe reaction was overwhelming,â€ Kleinman said. â€œIt struck a nerve with a lot of people.â€ Melanie Pittman, an teacher who lives on 5 acres near Crete, Illinois, said while everyone was stocking up on toilet paper, her partner ran over to the local home improvement store to stock up on seeds and gardening tools. Pittman is more than doubling her garden, planting corn, beans, tomatoes, potatoes, onions and growing mushrooms. She is also working with other growers in her community to expand her reliance on local food. â€œI try to reach out to other individuals who are growing food in the area, to avoid the overlap - â€˜I grow tomatoes, you grow carrots,â€™â€ she said. Gardening may be a rare positive trend to emerge from the crippling pandemic, said Diane Blazek, executive director of the U.S. industry group National Garden Bureau. â€œWeâ€™ll come out in the end and hopefully everyone will be eating better and gardening more and more self-reliant,â€ she said.

318,"Sports betting: Table tennis, NFL draft popular on FanDuel, DraftKings",Alex Sherman@sherman4949Jabari Young@JabariJYoung,"Sports may no longer be blaring on television screens across the country, but that's not deterring some gamblers from placing bets on anything that they can get odds on -- table tennis, comments made during presidential debates, even video game sports competitions. This year was supposed to be a huge growth opportunity for sites like FanDuel and DraftKings, who are pushing to get licensed in more states across the country. Seventeen states have legalized sports betting, and many others have proposed state bills that would make them legal in coming years. DraftKings is pushing forward with a plan to become a publicly traded entity through a reverse merger with Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company. But that was before the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic shut down nearly every major sporting event: The NCAA's ""March Madness"" championship tournament was canceled entirely. The National Basketball Association, PGA Tour, Major League Baseball, and the National Hockey League are on hiatus. As a result, New Jersey sportsbooks lost out on nearly $370 million in sports wagers in March, according to PlayNJ estimates. ""Shutdowns from the coronavirus pandemic are affecting New Jersey's gaming industry in ways that are unprecedented, and that will continue until the country begins to return to some semblance of normalcy,"" said Dustin Gouker, lead research analyst for PlayNJ.com. Gamblers have nowhere else to turn, as U.S. casinos are closed, so online sports books are searching for new and creative wagers to keep customers engaged. This month's NFL Draft will provide a boost. Sportsbooks have come up with about 150 different proposition bets around the NFL Draft -- about three times more than ever before, said Chad Milmann, The Action Network's chief content officer. About $5 million will be wagered on this year's NFL draft in the U.S., a five-fold increase over last year's amount, Bet-NJ.com estimates, bringing in about $500,000 for the industry. Sites like FanDuel and DraftKings are offering expanded bets, such as so-called ""over/unders"" on the number of players drafted from a certain college -- there's so little going on, they've had time to get comfortable doing the research to set odds around these more obscure bets, Milmann said. But the main attraction of the gambling world for the past month has been table tennis, said DraftKings Head of Sportsbook Johnny Avello. International table tennis matches have continued through global quarantines, and they're one of the few live events that bettors can get legal odds on from sportsbooks in the U.S. ""Who would think that people would bet on table tennis point by point, in-game wagering, how many games they're going to play, how many sets they're going to go?"" Avello said. ""That's the biggest phenomenon that's I've seen out of everything we've done so far."" DraftKings has pushed the envelope on coming up with wagers during this slow time for gamblers, concocting bets about what will happen on TV shows such as ""Real Housewives of New York"" and ""Shark Tank."" The site enticed 70,000 bettors to a pool about what presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were going to say in their March 16 debate. ""We had people bet on what words they're going to say, like how many times they're going to say 'billionaire,' things of that nature,"" Avello said. ""That kind of kicked off our [weird bets] and we've been doing them probably five, six times a day ever since then."" All sportsbooks are somewhat limited on what they can offer because gambling odds and categories have to be approved by gambling regulation entities before they can go live to the public. DraftKings' out-of-the-box bets have to be free, though winners can get actual money to spend on the site. At the same time, sportsbooks have successfully pushed for legalization of gambling on esports for the first time ever in the U.S. to take advantage of prolonged downtime without live sports. The Nevada Gaming Control this week legalized wagering on three esports events -- Overwatch League, League of Legends European Championship and the North America League of Legends Championship. Sportsbooks have long resisted gambling on esports given questions about the ease of throwing matches and other credibility issues, said Patrick Keane, CEO of The Action Network, the analysis and media company dedicate to sports gambling. Still, New Jersey is pushing for similar approvals to Nevada. ""The integrity issues around esports are still pretty profound,"" Keane said. ""But there's a lot of pressure to allow esports gambling for the major online sportsbooks in New Jersey."" While zany bets may pass the time temporarily, FanDuel and DraftKings, which make up about 80% of the NJ gambling market, continue to hold out hope that professional sports will return this year. There is a bit of good news for the online betting industry, however: Online casino and poker revenue set a new record in New Jersey with $64.8 million in revenue, up 18% over the state's previous monthly high, according to PlayUSA.com.

120,BREAKING NEWS! Latest Research Published by Chinese Scientists Say Coronavirus Will Render Most Male Patients Infertile,Anonymous,"A latest coronavirus research by medical scientists from Anonymousjing Medical University and Suzhou Hospital lead by Dr Jianqing Wang, Head of the Department of Urology, at Suzhou Hospital say that certain males affected by the SARS-Cov2 coronavirus which causes the Covid-19 disease might likely become infertile even if they recover from the infection. According to the new researched published in medrxiv, an open source online medical journal, the coronavirus typically attacks the ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2)) receptors in human tissues.
 
The team of urology researchers  that comprised of Dr Jianqing Wang, Dr Caibin Fan, Dr Kai Li, Dr Yanhong Ding and Dr Wei Lu focused primarily on renal and testicular tissues as these were also ‘rich’  with ACE2 receptors especially the renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in the testis.

The study results showed that the new coronavirus expressed potent pathogenicity to both renal and testicular tissues with resultant lesions.

The damaged testicular tissues could lead to infertility in most of the male patients.
 
The researchers  advised that during drug treatments with coronavirus infected patients, clinicians should pay careful attention to renal function evaluation as some of the antivirals which known to exhibit renal toxicity can aggravate the and virus damaged kidneys.
 
The researchers also advised that all clinicians pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-ups, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in male patients' fertility.
 
The research was based on the datasets of 146 male patients in three different settings.
 
Thailand Medical News notes that the research has yet to have been peer reviewed.
 
However, the results on this research could have large implications and effect on the thousands of male patients infected with the coronavirus.",1,
71,"When Available, COVID-19 Vaccines May be Hazardous to Human Health",Stephen Lendman,"In cahoots with government, Big Pharma is more concerned about profits than human health.

Drug companies see a potential boAnonymousza by developing and marketing a COVID-19 vaccine once testing is completed — likely to be available later this year. 

What everyone should know about vaccines and their hazards goes unreported.

All vaccines contain harmful toxins, including mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol (antifreeze), and squalene adjuvants that weaken and can destroy the human immune system, making it vulnerable to many annoying to life-threatening illnesses.

The 1976 H1N1 swine flu vaccines caused hundreds of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a serious neurological disease.

The 2009 H1N1 vaccine contained  thimerosal as a preservative, a form of hazardous mercury, along with other toxins listed above.

The 1976 vaccine was especially hazardous. Johns Hopkins School of Public Health’s Institute for Vaccine Safety director Neal Halsey MD noted “a lot of deaths, many in otherwise healthy, normal children after being vaccinated.

Vaccines can be more hazardous than diseases they’re designed to protect against.

Of special concern is their potentially dangerous effect on young children and the elderly.

Information below is from earlier writing that’s edited and updated on vaccine hazards to human health.

Under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Reporting System) was established.

Annually, it reports thousands of serious adverse vaccine reactions, including up to 200 deaths and many more permanent disabilities.

Far more alarming is the following:

The FDA earlier estimated that only 1% of serious adverse reactions are reported, the CDC at the time estimating 10%.
In earlier congressional testimony, medical school students said they were told not to report these incidents.
International studies show vaccines cause up to 10,000 US SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) deaths annually, at least half the number from vaccines.
Another earlier study determined that 3,000 US children die annually from vaccines.
Poor US reporting suggests that annual adverse vaccine reactions in the country number from 100,000 to one million.
From 1988 to 2010, the government’s National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) paid families of adversely affected children $1.2 billion in damages.
As authorized by the 2006 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, US Health and Human Services (HHS) granted drug companies legal immunity (except for impossible to prove willful misconduct) to market hazardous H1N1 Swine Flu vaccines globally.

Vaccines are legally mandated in all 50 US states as part of mass immunizations of children.

In settling vaccine damage suits, drug companies impose gag orders to keep vital information concealed from the public.

Insurers refuse to cover adverse vaccine reactions because of high potential liability they’d face.

Vaccinations cause high numbers of severe reactions, permanent disabilities, and deaths as well as an enormous personal and public cost. Virtually none of this gets publicly reported.

Vaccines are less effective than claimed.

Medical literature documents significant numbers of vaccine failures for measles, mumps, smallpox, pertussis, polio and Hib-causing bacterial meningitis and pneumonia.

Evidence shows that vaccinations are an unreliable and dangerous way to prevent illness and disease.

Earlier low US disease rates were unrelated to vaccines.

From 1850 – 1940, well before mandatory vaccination programs, the British Association for the Advancement of Science reported a 90% decrease in childhood diseases due to improved sanitation and hygiene practices.

By 1945, US medical authorities noted a 95% drop in deaths from the leading childhood infectious diseases (diphtheria, pertussis, scarlet fever and measles), well before mass-immunizations began.

An earlier WHO report found that third world disease and mortality rates had no direct correlation with immunization programs, but closely relate to proper sanitation, personal hygiene and dietary practices.

No evidence links vaccines to infectious disease declines. Proper hygiene and healthy eating may be far more effective.

Vaccines don’t guarantee immunization against diseases they’re designed to protect against.

Although vaccines stimulate antibody production, no evidence suggests that alone assures immunity.

A 1950 British Medical Council-published study found no relationship between antibody count and disease incidence.

Natural immunization involves many bodily organs and systems. Artificially producing antibodies can’t achieve it.

Research also shows how squalene adjuvants harm the human immune system, making it susceptible to numerous illnesses and diseases ranging from very annoying to life threatening.

The “herd immunity” notion of mass-immunizations effectiveness is largely discredited.

Just the opposite is true as evidence shows that fully vaccinated populations have experienced epidemics numerous times in the past.

Vaccine effectiveness remains scientifically unproven because no double blind studies have been conducted to provide convincing evidence.

Recent and earlier disease outbreaks affected more vaccinated children than unvaccinated ones.

A one size fits all standard is troublesome. It lets newborns get the same dose as a five-year-old.

Dubious quality control practices are tolerated that produce what’s known as “Hot Lots” – associated with disproportionately high death and disability rates.

The FDA hasn’t acted preventatively against them. Vaccine lots are seldom recalled even when associated with severe adverse reactions.

They’re administered under the assumption that all recipients largely respond the same way, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, genetic makeup, or other characteristics.

An earlier New England Journal of Medicine-reported study found that a significant number of Romanian children receiving polio vaccine contracted the disease.

Evidence linked the outbreak two antibiotic injections. One inoculation raised the polio risk eight-fold; two – nine shots, 27-fold, and 10 or more 182-fold.

New research may reveal other unknown hazards, but public safety won’t be addressed until government health officials act responsibly, report accurately, and adequately protect populations from vaccines they never should allow.

Many supposed vaccine truths proved false.

Claims about dangers of common childhood diseases are false.

CDC data show a 99.8% pertussis recovery rate during the 1992-94 period.

Many common childhood diseases are benign and self-limiting. They usually impart lifelong immunity, whereas vaccine-induced immunization (when achieved) is only temporary.

Most infectious diseases are treatable and can produce immunity against further outbreaks.

Childhood disease dangers are greatly exaggerated to scare parents into getting their children vaccinated with unsafe drugs.

Polio vaccinations can cause the disease.

In 1955, when the Salk vaccine was introduced, polio was considered the most serious post-war public health problem.

A year later, six New England states reported sharp rises, ranging from more than double in Vermont to a 642% increase in Massachusetts.

Other states also were badly impacted enough for Idaho and Utah to halt immunizations due to increased incidence and death rates.

In 1962 congressional testimony, Dr. Bernard Greenberg, Biostatistics Department head at the University of North Carolina, reported sharp polio increases from 1957 to 1959 and a Public Health Service whitewash that suppressed it.

In 1985, the CDC reported that 87% of US cases between 1973 and 1983 were caused by the vaccine. Later the agency admitted that vaccines caused nearly all imported cases.

Misdiagnosing, poor reporting, and cover-ups suggest that the actual number of vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) cases may be 10 to 100 times higher than numbers cited by the CDC.

In 1977, Jonas Salk admitted that mass inoculations caused most polio cases since 1961.

The Salk vaccine proved highly dangerous. Information about it was suppressed, and declines in the disease were well underway when mass-immunizations began.

In Europe, they occurred in countries that used, then rejected the vaccine, proving it was never needed in the first place.

It’s true as well about vaccines for other diseases.

Lack of an initial adverse reaction does not prove vaccines are safe.

Documented longterm health problems include arthritis, chronic headaches, rashes indicative of disease, non-healing skin lesions, seizures, autism, anemia, multiple sclerosis, ALS, cancer, and many others.

Ingredients common to all vaccines are at issue. Squalene adjuvants are a biological time bomb that can harm or destroy the human immune system.

Chemical ranking systems rate many vaccine ingredients among the most hazardous to human health substances, even in microscopic doses.

Earlier epidemiological research by Dr. Bart Classen found that vaccines cause 79% of insulin type I diabetes cases in children under 10.

The sharp rise in numerous other diseases may also be linked to mass-immunizations.

California’s autism rate skyrocketed 1,000% from around 1990 – 2010.

In the 1990s, MMR vaccine usage in Britain (for measles, mumps and rubella) occurred at the same time autism rose sharply.

The January 2000 Journal of Adverse Drug Reactions reported that no adequate testing was done, so the vaccine never should have been licensed.

According to the Autism Society, the disease “is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain…”

According to the CDC and National Vaccine Information Center, one in every 150 US children develop the disease.

Tens of millions are affected worldwide, making it more common than pediatric cancer, incurable type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes and AIDS combined.

In the early 1940s, prior to mass immunizations, autism was so rare that few doctors ever encountered it. Today it’s a global pandemic.

Longterm adverse vaccination reactions have been suppressed and ignored in spite of the alarming correlation between their use and the rise of autoimmune and other diseases.

Vaccines are more about profits than disease protection. Avoiding them is essential to protecting human health and well-being.

Claims that vaccines are key to preventing diseases are false.

During the 1849 US cholera outbreak, homeopathic hospitals documented a 3% death rate compared to 48 – 60% in conventional medical facilities.

More recent epidemiological studies show homeopathic remedies are superior to vaccines in preventing diseases.

They’re safe, effective, and free from toxic side effects — yet most often not covered by insurers.

Alternative treatments and remedies have been safe and effective for generations. Yet the medical establishment and governments spurn them.

Although all US states require vaccinations, laws vary by state. Legal exemptions exist.

They’re allowed for persons susceptible to adverse reactions, religious and other reasons.

The US and other governments prioritize corporate interests over public health and welfare.

Vaccination history shows documented evidence of government deception about  vaccines — promoting their dubious effectiveness while ignoring their hazards.

The US FDA, HHS and CDC are stacked with corporate officials who return to high-paying industry jobs provided they place profit considerations over public health and safety.

In November 2000, concern over the above and adverse vaccine reactions got the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) to pass a uAnonymousimous resolution that called for a moratorium on mandatory childhood vaccinations and for doctors to insist on “truly informed consent for (their) use…”

In October 1999, Dr. Bart Classen, founder and CEO of Classen Immunotherapies, told Congress:

“It is clear…that the government’s immunization policies are driven by politics and not by science.”

“I can give numerous examples where employees of the US Public Health Service…appear to be furthering their careers by acting as propaganda officers to support political agendas.”

“In one case…employees of a foreign government, who were funded and working closely with the US Public Health Service, submitted false data to a major medical journal.”

“The true data indicated the vaccine (in question) was dangerous. However, the false data” indicated no risk.

“Four letters from the FDA/Public Health Service…clearly reveal(ed) that the anthrax vaccine” approved for US military personnel was done “without the manufacturer performing a single controlled clinical trial.”

They’re essential to determine safety and effectiveness. Failure to conduct them proved devastating to the health and well-being of recipients.

US military forces receive many or all of the following vaccinations:

Three shots for hepatitis B
Two for hepatitis A
Annual influenza shots
All US military personnel must have documented proof of receiving vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (chicken pox), and polio.

Smallpox vaccines are administered every ten years to career military personnel — the same procedure followed for tetanus-diphtheria, pertussis, typhoid, and at times for yellow fever.

Multiple doses are given for anthrax and rabies. Service personnel are screened for and given shots for tuberculosis and various other diseases, depending on where in the world they’re deployed.

Multiple vaccinations for all US military personnel practically assures damage to their immune systems, risking severe health problems later in life.

A healthy diet, plenty of water daily, no smoking and little or no alcohol consumption, daily exercise, proper sanitation and personal hygiene practices, natural substances like vitamin C and D, natural herbal remedies, and other good health practices are far more effective in preventing diseases than vaccines.

A Final Comment

Viera Scheibner is a highly respected scientist, researcher, and vaccine expert.

Earlier she called “vaccinators the snake oil salesmen of our time,” adding:

The vaccine industrial complex is “an illness industry (that) causes a pandemic (of) degenerative diseases (and) behavioral problems.”

“Ever since the turn of the (last) century, medical journals published dozens and dozens of articles demonstrating that injecting vaccines (can) cause anaphylaxis, meaning harmful, inappropriate immunological responses, which is also called sensitization.”

“(This) increase(s) susceptibility to the disease which the vaccine is supposed to prevent, and to a host of related and other unrelated infections.”

“We see it in vaccinated children within days  (or) two or three weeks.”

Most adversely affected children “develop runny noses, ear infections, pneumonitis, (and) bronchiolitis.”

“It is only a matter of degrees, which indicates immuno-suppression, (not immunity).”

“So I never use the word immunization because that is false advertising. It implies that vaccines immunize, which they don’t. The correct term is either vaccination or sensitization.”

“Vaccines (can also) damage internal organs, particularly the pancreas.”

Everyone vaccinated, including for seasonal flu, is vulnerable to contracting severe “autoimmune diseases like diabetes,” Addison’s disease, arthritis, asthma, Guillian-Barre Syndrome, hepatitis, Lou Gehrig’s disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, polio, and many other health problems.

Some kill. Others cause lifetime disability and pain. It’s because autoimmune diseases happen when the “body attacks itself.”

More accurately, it’s attacked by unhealthy living, stress, and harmful ingested substances.

All of the above information bears testimony to why COVID-19 vaccines should be shunned when available.

And make no mistake, they’re coming with lots of deceptive fanfare. Ignore it.",1,
369,Trump: 'Anybody who wants a test gets a test' amid shortage for coronavirus,Lauren Hirsch@laurenshirsch,"Topping a week of conflicting statements from the administration about how many tests the U.S. is now able to administer for the coronavirus, President Donald Trump on Friday told reporters at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta that ""anybody who wants a test gets a test."" U.S. health officials started the week by defending themselves to members of Congress for a shortage of tests across the country. That shortage, along with tight restrictions from the CDC on who could be tested, allowed infected people to go undetected and further spread it, say health experts. After being rebuked for the delays, Food and Drug Administration chief Stephen Hahn on Tuesday told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that, with the aid of private sector partnerships, the government would be able to test roughly a million individuals by the end of the week. But by Thursday, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters he expects public laboratories this week to test 400,000 people. Later that day, Vice President Mike Pence said ""we don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward."" Pence is leading the government's response to the COVID-19 outbreak. A spokesperson for the CDC did not respond to requests to confirm the number of people who have been tested for the coronavirus. Part of the administration's hope in expediting its testing capability was partnering with the private sector to help make up for limitations created by what experts say is an underfunded public health system. The CDC is partnering with Integrated DNA Technologies to manufacture the tests under a CDC contract. IDT is partnering with commercial labs, including LabCorp and Quest for the testing, both companies have confirmed. ""What was different was this response,"" said John Auerbach, CEO of the Trust for America's Health and former head of the CDC's policy office. ""The administration said it wasn't just going to use public health labs as its core â€” it was going to say to the commercial sector, you develop these, get them out the door. ... [But] that assumed they had the capacity to get these kits out the door."" ""But there are no real mechanisms for monitoring how much their capacity is â€” it's kind of a wild west."" LabCorp said Thursday its coronavirus test would be available at 6 p.m. that day. Quest said its test would be available Monday. Meantime the number of infected people continues to grow. There are at least 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Pence said Friday that 21 people on the Grand Princess cruise ship off California have tested positive. The growing count has led to mounting frustration by many in Congress over what they say are the president's conflicting statements and a lack of transparency amid a public health crisis. ""They won't disclose how many test kits are now available or when they will be fully deployed, but we know that they haven't come close to the one million mark,"" said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., in a statement to CNBC. ""Congress has done its job in providing emergency funding for the Administration to acquire, stockpile, and distribute an adequate supply of diagnostics,"" Schakowsky wrote. ""The question remains, is this Administration capable of doing so?""",0,
187,Is COVID-19 Our New Sputnik Moment?,Robert Weissberg,"American universities are troubled institutions.  More serious than the attention-getting P.C. madness, however, has been the subversion of intellectual standards — armies of ""diversity and inclusion"" bureaucrats tasked with admitting unqualified students academically dependent on easy-to-pass fluff courses in gender studies and the like.  Add grade inflation and, if that fails, endless tutoring to push troubled students to meaningless degrees.  If that, too, fails, eliminate admissions tests to end ""white privilege.""  

So far, efforts to reverse this intellectual decline have fallen short, but, as odd as it may seem, the COVID-19 virus outbreak and the attendant fiAnonymouscial crisis offer an intriguing never-waste-a-crisis possibility.  A possible parallel exists with the 1957 ""Sputnik moment,"" an event that likewise inspired panic — the sudden dread of being defenselessness against Soviet nuclear missiles.

Specifically, today's pandemic has raised troubling issues regarding America's dependence on the Chinese pharmaceutical supply chain, our declining technological prowess vis-à-vis China and the long-delayed realization that that China with its penchant for intellectual property theft, hacking, and rampant counterfeiting is a hostile rival, not our friend.  This fresh reality understood, does it really make sense to require top universities to squander millions on guaranteed-to-fail social engineering while China races ahead technologically?

The COVID-19 pandemic should be a wake-up call, a message that pushing our universities to pursue racial/sex equality at the expense of intellectual rigor guarantees national disaster.  Time to acknowledge that forcing chemistry professors to waste untold hours ""diversifying"" their now dumbed down syllabus imposes opportunity costs that hardly burden our Chinese rivals. 

Recall the ""Sputnik moment.""  When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I on October 4 of 1957, not only was it a national humiliation (Russian science was believed to be ""too backward"" for such an accomplishment),but propelling it into orbit demonstrated that ""the Reds"" possessed an unstoppable rocket capable of hitting the U.S. with a nuclear payload.  The shock re-awakened memories of Pearl Harbor.  That Sputnik was visible in the night sky left no doubt — we were behind, and way behind. Fixing our supposedly defective education system was central, and the response was quick.  Congress created a blue-ribbon panel to investigate, military notables such as Admiral Hyman Rickover sounded the alarm, and newspapers demanded action.  A Gallup poll of the day found that 70% of respondents believed that high school students should work harder.  Congress passed  the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) in 1958, a once unthinkable federal intervention in educational funding.  Key provisions included loans to future teachers in the sciences and mathematics plus grants to states to upgrade what is today called STEM fields.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was funded to help close the technology gap while allocations for the National Science Foundation (NSF) skyrocketed

More significant was a cultural shift.  Nerdiness was now celebrated, and schools top to bottom ramped up their advance programs for the scientifically gifted.  There were TV quiz shows like the College Bowl featuring elite college students outsmarting each other for prizes.  A story in Life magazine depicted American high schoolers dancing all night while their Soviet counterparts mastered calculus.  Newly elected President Kennedy made technology — the race to the moon — a centerpiece of his administration.  Meanwhile, the influx of Baby-Boomers into college meant that high standards were absolutely necessary to manage overflowing enrollment.  In short, brain power was linked to national survival, and it was all hands-on deck to beat the Russians, and nobody cared that the wizards of science were nearly all white males.

Todays' likely ""Sputnik moment"" in education will be the realization that non-U.S. students, especially those from China, constitute much of our STEM brain power needed to fight this and countless others health battles.

Begin with the numbers.  In 2017, the proportion of non-U.S. full-time graduate students enrollees in electrical engineering was 81%; in computer science 79%;  in mechanical engineering 62%; in chemical engineering 57%; and metallurgical/materials engineering, 55%,  If sub-divided by country of origin, the Chinese domination of these non-U.S. students is clear.  In 2017–18, there were some 162,000 Chinese graduate students in STEM fields (and 201,000 in non-STEM disciplines).  The runners up were Indians (154,000) with a huge gap among other nationalities — Saudi Arabia with 20,000 was in third place, 17,000 from South Korea, and so on.  Yes, many Americans are now flocking to high-tech fields, but the data show even larger surges among those from abroad. 

Now imagine the ""Sputnik Moment"" in January of 2121

Before a massive crowd at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, two Chinese virologists, both MIT Ph.D.s announce cures for COVID-19 and a 100% effective vaccine.  President Xi also has an important announcement.  Under his new ""讓中國再次偉大 (""Make China Great Again"") initiative, the thousands of Chinese at foreign universities would soon be returning home to continue their research at dozens of state-of-the-art facilities fiAnonymousced by funds otherwise spent buying U.S. debt.  In five years, he promises, China will be the world center of advanced scientific research.  He wishes America best of luck with their home-grown talent.       

The likely outcome of President Xi's I ""讓中國再次偉大 initiative would be national hysteria.  Universities would request government bailouts to cover millions in lost tuition.  Thousands of classes in math and science would be canceled as instructors returned to China.  Ongoing research projects by the hundreds would be suspended when lab workers and supervisors resigned their positions.

Now, what can be done before this Sputnik Moment arrives?            

If we reasonably assume that domestic brainpower exists, the problem becomes how to find and cultivate it, ensure that super-bright youngsters seek scientific careers, and then fund them generously.  Hardly daunting — we did this for decades in the past, and recall the U.S. space program,  Silicon Valley, the internet and countless other ""Made in America"" technical innovations when we had a smaller population.  The patriarchy cured polio and invented the transistor.  Brainy Americans are not like whales, who mysteriously vanish thanks to shifting ocean currents.

The culture also has to change, merit has to replace diversity über alles, and somebody has to bell the cat about the fashionable nonsense in universities that sap funds from serious intellectual endeavors.  Combatting hate is not the core purpose of intellectual life, and can we justify spending millions on airhead college majors when universities cannot staff basic science courses?   K–12 programs for the gifted should return to their original mission, with admission based on tough objective exams, not waste millions trying to uncover hidden talents in minorities.  The mass media should celebrate brain power qua brain power even if the geniuses are white males.  Yes, it is unfortunate that a deadly pandemic with its focus on Chinese malevolence may be required to trigger this cultural transformation, but a deadly wake-up call is still a wake-up call.",1,
263,The Great COVID-19 Vaccines to the Rescue Hoax. “Making A Billion Dollars” vs. “Harmful Side Effects”,Stephen Lendman,"Instead of serving the public interest by reporting truthfully on major issues, establishment media serve as press agents for powerful interests. Their managed news misinformation and disinformation includes the myth of barbarians at the gates to support endless wars on nations threatening no one, along with handouts to Wall Street and other corporate favorites — notably Big Pharma. US pharmaceutical and biotech companies have gotten billions of taxpayer dollars to finance their research — drugs developed sold to US consumers at unacceptably high prices. In 2017, attorney James Young involved in Big Pharma litigation, health fraud, and consumer protection, asked: “How do we make $1 billion?” “Big Pharma’s focus on profits often comes at the expense of patient safety,” he added. “If there is no disease criteria consistent with the symptoms that a company’s drug treats, then the company creates a disease” or a pretext to use its drugs for maximum profits. “They pay physicians, research institutions, and universities to come up with different disease criteria that are consistent with the symptoms that the drug treats.”

While required to inform consumers of possible harmful side effects, at times they’re hidden, including results of clinical trials.

Making “a billion dollars” requires selling a drug “to a broad market.” Promotion is key, especially by television advertising and getting physician endorsements.

Other methods are also used to market drugs, including unsafe ones, notably vaccines.

All vaccines are hazardous to human health, often causing diseases they’re supposed to protect against.

Even the WHO admitted that more polio cases were caused by vaccines than from the virus itself.

When available, the risk will be extremely high that COVID-19 vaccines may cause serious health problems to individuals permitting themselves to be vaxxed.

At this time, no drugs exist to cure COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine a promising exception.

It’s an anti-malarial drug around for decades that showed positive results in treating COVID-19 patients. Big Pharma and Bill Gates, in cahoots with Anthony Fauci and other corrupt officials it bribed to support its agenda, want nothing interfering with their diabolical plot to mass-vax humanity with toxins able to kill or otherwise seriously harm human health — substances to be included in a COVID-19 drug when available.

Vaccine development takes around three to four years. Most clinical trials fail.

Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines because of the potential profit bonanza.

Instead of following vaccine development protocol, they’re cutting corners at the expense of safety and efficacy.

It’s virtually impossible to develop a vaccine in months as opposed to required years of testing.

Among others, two companies in the news are Germany’s CureVac and Massachusetts-based Moderna.

Thailand Medical News (TMN) reported that “CureVac’s CEO resigned, and the company received a huge public investment, with the promise to deliver a vaccine by autumn 2020,” adding:

“CureVac’s promises for a different vaccine ended up with nothing to show for but a failed phase 2 clinical trial.”

Moderna began human trials “without any previous preclinical testing for efficacy or safety,” TMN explained.

At least three individuals involved as test subjects for its COVID-19 vaccine had adverse reactions.

One individual said he developed a 103 degree temperature and needed urgent medical treatment.

Potential longer-term hazards to his health remain to be discovered.

TMN noted that Moderna never successfully brought a drug to market through required clinical trials.

According to vaccine experts, the company failed to disclose data on its vaccine development, focusing instead on non-specific PR information to the public.

TMN criticized its approach, calling it “words, not data,” the latter what science requires.

Moderna reportedly enlisted 45 test subjects for its phase 1 trial, publicly reporting early results on 8 alone. What about the other 37?

According to vaccine researcher Dr. Anna Durbin, “(w)e don’t know if (reported) antibodies (in 8 subjects) are durable?”

When asked for more data on its test results, Moderna’s communications director Colleen Hussey said disclosure will come later — in what form and how detailed not explained.

According to TMN, the company “doesn’t publish on its work in scientific journals.”

“What is known has been disclosed through press releases. That’s not enough to generate confidence within the scientific community.”

Separately in mid-May, Pompeo said the Trump regime is “committed” to holding China accountable for widespread COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths it had nothing to do with.

Blaming others for its own wrongdoing is longstanding US policy, including nations victimized by US aggression.

Trump regime hostility toward China ignited a new Cold War that could turn hot if Washington pushes things too far.",1,
85,"No reported case of a child passing coronavirus to an adult exists, evidence review shows",Hayley Dixon,"No child has been found to have passed coronavirus to an adult, a review of evidence in partnership with the Royal College of Paediatricians has found.

Major studies into the impact of Covid-19 on young children show it is likely that they ""do not play a significant role"" in spreading the virus and are significantly less likely to become infected than adults.

While experts have said more evidence is needed, they note that there has not been a single case of a child under 10 transmitting the virus even in contact tracing carried out by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in January and February.",1,
244,Global warming boosters dismayed: Turns out coronavirus hates heat,Andrea Widberg,"For decades, leftists have blamed all actual or potentially harmful events on global warming. They then justify their political initiatives — from socialism to open borders to abortion — as reasonable responses to climate change. Since the Chinese Virus appeared on the scene, however, the world's leftists have fallen silent about global warming. That silence may have to become permanent because it seems that coronavirus hates the heat.
People have speculated that the coronavirus, like most viruses, prefers cold, dry weather to warm, wet weather. Indeed, that common knowledge is what led President Trump to say he believes that the coronavirus will start retreating in April.
Two studies indicate that Trump's instincts may be correct. Four Chinese professors who studied the coronavirus's spread in China concluded that it does retreat in the face of warmer, wetter weather (emphasis added):
This paper investigates how air temperature and humidity influence the transmission of COVID-19. After estimating the serial interval of COVID-19 from 105 pairs of the virus carrier and the infected, we calculate the daily effective reproductive number, R, for each of all 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases. Using the daily R values from January 21 to 23, 2020 as proxies of non-intervened transmission intensity, we find, under a linear regression framework for 100 Chinese cities, high temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19, respectively, even after controlling for population density and GDP per capita of cities. One degree Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity lower R by 0.0383 and 0.0224, respectively. This result is consistent with the fact that the high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of influenza. It indicates that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19.
Another study out of the University of Maryland hypothesizes that the virus exists along a very narrow latitude, one that's cold in the winter and spring (although not as severe as at the poles):
We examined climate data from cities with significant community spread of COVID-19 using ERA-5 reanalysis, and compared to areas that are either not affected, or do not have significant community spread. To date, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has established significant community spread in cities and regions along a narrow east west distribution roughly along the 30–50o N' corridor at consistently similar weather patterns consisting of average temperatures of 5-11oC, combined with low specific (3–6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4–7 g/m3). There has been a lack of significant community establishment in expected locations that are based only on population proximity and extensive population interaction through travel. 
Here's the world temperature map from the study. The black circles represent regions with significant coronavirus transmission. Significantly, they all exist along the green band, with warmer climates less affected:
Theoretically, if we want to protect ourselves from the coronavirus, we must back away from all the climate change efforts we've been making. The Manhattan Contrarian spells out the practical effects of this conclusion:
Immediately give up using re-usable tote bags, and go for single use plastic grocery bags. Those reusable tote bags pick up germs and spread them all over the place for days. You need bags that you can use once and get rid of immediately before they infect you and everyone around you. John Tierney has the scoop in today's New York Post: ""Researchers have been warning for years about the risks of these [reusable] bags spreading deadly viral and bacterial diseases, but public officials have ignored their concerns, determined to eliminate single-use bags and other plastic products despite their obvious advantages in reducing the spread of pathogens."" Tierney has plenty more details at the link, including citations to articles in scientific journals. And while you're at it, those highly sanitary single use plastic straws are also an excellent option to avoid contact between your lips and what may be a contaminated cup or glass.
To the extent that you must travel around, you can avoid all common conveyances (planes, trains and buses). Those could be filled with carriers of the virus. Instead, go by yourself in an automobile. Carpool? Forget it. How do you know that your companion is not infected? It's one person per car for the duration.
Crank up the thermostat. Researchers in China have determined that the coronavirus spreads most successfully at 8.72 deg C (that's about 48 deg F), and its spread slows progressively the warmer you get from there. ""The study, by a team from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou ... [concluded that] the 'virus is highly sensitive to high temperature.'"" To be fair, this study was more about outdoor than indoor temperatures; but why take a chance in the environment you can control?",1,

34,Cruelty' in reports black cats killed for COVID-19 Cure,Sun Media,"As if Donald Trump’s reckless suggestions of unproven COVID-19 cures weren’t causing enough trouble, the black cat population in Vietnam is imperilled by another dangerous claim.
Reports from animal rights activists say felines of that colour are being collected, killed and their bodies ground up as a supposed coronavirus treatment, according to The South West News Service.
The No to Dog Meat charity claims black cats are boiled, skinned and cooked before being turned into paste and sold as COVID-19 medicine. The gruesome practice is said to be centred around the city of Hanoi, but the concoction also is being sold online, the news outlet reported.
Graphic pictures and video purportedly show rows of dead cats drying in the sun after being slaughtered, as well as a live cat being boiled and the paste mixture being fed to a human baby.
Charity founder Julia de Cadenet said the footage made her blood curdle.
“People all over the world are understandably terrified of COVID-19, but this does not excuse the horrific cruelty that Vietnamese people are inflicting on these poor cats,” she said. “There is no evidence whatsoever that eating cats cures coronavirus, and even if there was, this inhumane treatment is a level of cruelty that is unacceptable even for those who eat meat.”",1,
86,"Kids don't play a 'significant role' in spreading coronavirus to adults, research suggests",Bradley Jolly,"There is no strong evidence that children under ten have passed coronavirus onto adults, researchers have suggested. 

Young children ""do not play a significant role"" in spreading the virus and are significantly less likely to become infected than adults, according to a review of existing research into Covid-19 and children by the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health (RCPCH) said.

It worked with other research teams to examine the correlation in studies of transmission from children to adults after public health officials in Switzerland said today under-10s could finally hug their grandparents again as they pose no risk to them.

The review, by the Don't Forget the Bubbles paediatric research project, stated: ""Notably, the China/WHO joint commission could not recall episodes during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult."" But the review also urged caution as it is still unknown whether children have passed on the virus, particularly given large numbers of asymptomatic cases.

A nine-year-old British boy who contracted coronavirus in a French Alps did not pass it on, despite having contact with more than 170 people at three schools. This case was studied as part of the research.

Dr Alasdair Munro, the clinical research fellow in paediatric infectious diseases who led the research, said: ""Covid-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection. There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare.

""The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role."" Professor Russell Viner, the president of the RCPCH, said: ""From around the world, we are not seeing evidence that children are involved in spreading or transmitting the virus, but we do not have enough evidence.""

Prof Viner added that it was too soon to say children could hug their grandparents, particularly as the over-70s are the most vulnerable.",1,
113,BELGIUM HEALTH MINISTER PUTS BAN ON NON-ESSENTIAL SEXUAL ACTIVITIES OF PERSONS 3 OR GREATER IN INDOOR AREAS,Anonymous,"Belgium Health Minister Maggie de Block has put a ban on all non-essential sexual activities of persons 3 or greater in indoor areas.
Health Minister de Block announced today that, effective immediately, “non-essential” sexual activities of 3 people or more are banned in Belgium to combat the spread of COVID-19.
De Block said she was forced to act swiftly because of Belgium’s reputation as being the “beer-drinking” and “group sex capital of Europe.” “Belgium is the beer-drinking and group sex capital of Europe, if not the world. We, as a nation, must address this situation,” De Block announced in Parliament. “Wife swapping, threesomes, and orgies of six, fifty, one hundred or more are not permitted until the outbreak settles down,” she announced in Parliament.
Health minister De Block did not ban single or two-person sexual practices such as masturbation, anal or oral sex, or even bestiality.
“These measures apply only to human-to-human sexual contact, not human-to-animal contact,” she added when questioned about bestiality by reporters.
A 2018 survey revealed that more than 78% of Belgian couples openly practice wife swapping, a cultural trait that became common practice in the 19th century under the rule of King Leopold II.

183,Miles Guo explains why CCP unleashed Wuhan coronavirus,GM35,"During his two live broadcasts on Saturday, Feb 8, Miles Guo explored the reasons behind the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak based on the intelligence he has gathered so far.

Wuhan coronavirus was manmade by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a biochemical weapon.
It was unleashed on purpose to target Hong Kong and certain political opponents within the communist party.
The lethality of the virus is out-of-control due to either unintentional human error or intentional revenge resulted from the internal power struggle within the CCP.
Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan made many enemies during their brutal consolidation of power and wealth, which affected over a million CCP members.

The CCP opened Pandora’s box but it backfired. Miles Guo disagreed with those who said that the CCP intended to kill half of the Chinese population especially older people with this manmade virus.

He did not think that the CCP wanted to use the virus to wipe out Hong Kong completely or to attack the U.S.

The unleash of manmade coronavirus was not a “collective” decision made by the Communist Party. Instead, it was a decision made by a small cadre of the kleptocrats at the top in order to impose martial law in Hong Kong and kill political opponents.

The original intention could be a limited and controllable viral attack to kill people in the city of Wuhan and Hong Kong with precision strike but somehow got out-of-hand due to sabotage or human error. Without disclosing his name, Miles Guo said a world-leading expert in the field of biochemical weapon confirmed with 100% certainty that Wuhan coronavirus is not from animals or nature but a lab in Wuhan.

407,US and Russia blocking UN plans for a global ceasefire amid crisis | US news | The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simontisdall,"The Trump administration and Russia are blocking efforts to win binding UN security council backing for a global ceasefire to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives worldwide. The UN secretary-general, AntÃ³nio Guterres, called for an immediate end to fighting involving governments and armed groups in all conflict areas almost one month ago. â€œThe fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war,â€ he said.Yet despite strong support for a universal truce from dozens of countries, including leading US allies such as Britain, France and Germany, as well as human rights groups, charities and the pope, the Trump administration is refusing to be bound by the measure. In an attempt to break the impasse, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has proposed a draft security council resolution which attempts to overcome US and Russian objections by, in effect, making it impossible to enforce.The resolution, as drafted, is understood to welcome the UN secretary-generalâ€™s appeal and express support for his efforts. But it does not insist on a binding, universal ceasefire, allowing exceptions to be made at the discretion of individual member states. The US objections arise from White House, Pentagon and State Department concerns that an all-encompassing measure could hinder their ability to prosecute military operations against terrorist groups, for example Isis in Iraq, and other targets that are deemed hostile to US interests. Russiaâ€™s president, Vladimir Putin, is believed to have similar reservations regarding the impact on Russian military operations in Syria and on Moscowâ€™s unacknowledged support for proxy groups and non-state militias in wartorn countries such as Libya. According to a special report published by the US-based Foreign Policy website, â€œboth governments fear that a universal ceasefire could potentially constrain their own efforts to mount what they consider legitimate counter-terrorism operations overseas. â€œThe US is also concerned that a blanket ceasefire could inhibit Israelâ€™s ability to engage in military operations throughout the Middle East,â€ the reportâ€™s author, Colum Lynch, said â€“ a reference to Israeli airstrikes in recent months on targets in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. In addition, analysts say, president Donald Trump and his advisers want to retain the freedom to launch attacks on pro-Iranian militia in Iraq, as happened recently, or carry out opportunistic strikes against Iranâ€™s military leaders, similar to the US drone strike in January that killed the Revolutionary Guards Corps general, Qassem Suleimani. Speaking on 23 March, Guterres appealed to warring parties across the globe to end hostilities and join together to fight Covid-19 instead. â€œEnd the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world. It starts by stopping the fighting everywhere. Now. That is what our human family needs, now more than ever,â€ he said.Guterresâ€™s call was endorsed earlier this month by charities, religious organisations and human rights groups. Pope Francis threw his weight behind it in an Easter Sunday address.On Friday, Henrietta Fore, head of the UN childrenâ€™s fund, Unicef, warned that 250 million children living in the â€œwaking nightmareâ€ of conflict desperately needed warring parties to stop fighting as the pandemic spread.More than 50 governments have also backed Guterresâ€™s initiative, including several Nato allies. In a joint letter, which the US and Russia declined to sign, they expressed concern that the UN security council had yet to take action. â€œAs the global Covid-19 pandemic spreads, we are concerned about the plight of women, children, and all civilians caught in armed conflicts â€¦ these populations are already impacted disproportionately by armed conflict. â€œAn immediate global ceasefire would markedly reduce these impacts, allow for much-needed humanitarian assistance and protection, and hopefully diminish the spread of Covid-19,â€ the letter said.Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary and acting prime minister, has pledged Britainâ€™s backing. Coronavirus was â€œthe fight of our lives and we must unite against itâ€, he said. But the US continues to prevaricate, while negotiations continue. Kelly Craft, US ambassador to the UN, expressed support for a global truce earlier this week and said she hoped the French resolution could be agreed soon, possibly this week. But a State Department spokesman was more circumspect. â€œThe United States supports the secretary-generalâ€™s call for a global ceasefire, but have noted that we will continue to fulfil our legitimate counter-terrorism mission,â€ the spokesman told Foreign Policy. Agreement on a ceasefire has been further delayed by US demands, now reportedly dropped, that the resolution refer to Covid-19 as the â€œWuhan virusâ€, a description that would have drawn a Chinese veto. The US also objected to language supportive of the World Health Organization, which Trump has attacked and defunded. Macron nevertheless expressed optimism on Wednesday that the draft resolution would be agreed. He said he had spoken personally to Trump, Chinaâ€™s president, Xi Jinping, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and all had offered their backing.Macron said he was hopeful Putin would also come onboard, and that a video summit of the five permanent members of the security council would be held to announce their agreement. While such an outcome may enhance the prestige of the council, which has been sharply criticised for inaction during the Covid-19 crisis, it may disappoint those demanding an unconditional truce and an effective, joined-up international response. If the big powers can choose to ignore a UN-mandated global ceasefire when it suits them, analysts warn, then non-state actors and terrorist groups may decide to do likewise. Since Guterres made his call last month, sporadic progress has been reported in several conflict zones. The Saudi-led coalition announced a ceasefire in Yemen, and there have been positive responses in Colombia and the Philippines. In all, the UN has cited 12 countries in which at least one party to a conflict has acknowledged the ceasefire appeal in order to battle the pandemic. But in Afghanistan, one of the worldâ€™s longest-running conflicts, there are signs that the growing impact of Covid-19 may be undermining tentative peace efforts, while Isis has called on its followers to attack the â€œcrusader nationsâ€ while they are distracted by the disease.",0,
374,The stock market is rising on hope for a pharma solution to coronavirus â€” here's how close we are,Thomas Franck@tomwfranck,"Markets have in recent weeks applauded the monumental efforts taken by Congress and the Federal Reserve to insulate the U.S. economy from the impact the coronavirus. But to traders across Wall Street, a vaccine, or at least an effective therapy, remains the No. 1 focus for the market to have a shot at clawing back more of the historic decline and one day reclaim a new high. Below is an updated rundown of who is working on drugs to combat the coronavirus and how close they are. Efforts to develop a vaccine appear promising at Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer, while Gilead Sciences drug remdesivir made headlines into the weekend on an anecdotal report of its success treating symptoms. Though big-ticket spending and small-business loans may provide some short-term market levity, investors say the speed at which the nation's biggest health-care companies can produce a Covid-19 remedy and get Americans back to work is key. ""All the while, as the cases continued to climb, the Federal Reserve came in such force and diligence that it helped underpin market stability along the entire financial structure,"" Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, wrote in an email. ""This is where the science comes in: Until there are therapies that are effective and readily available, fear of a second wave will keep the economy from heading back to what was normal,"" she added. The eradication of the coronavirus is so critical to the health of the U.S. economy that investors have snapped up stocks (both the broad market and individual companies) at the earliest of signs that the number of new cases could be slowing. And bullishness was on full display this week, when a report stated that a Chicago hospital using Gilead's remdesivir in a trial appeared to ease Covid-19 symptoms in the majority of patients treated with the drug. The University of Chicago's phase 3 drug trial indicated that most of its patients had ""rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms,"" two telltale Covid features, according to the report. Most patients were discharged in less than a week, health-care publication STAT News reported, citing a video it had obtained of doctors discussing the trial. Though the company later warned that such anecdotal evidence does not prove remdesivir is a reliable therapy for Covid, Gilead's stock popped nearly 10% on Friday and helped carry the major stock indexes to robust week-to-date gains. ""The ultimate phase for the market and for the overall trajectory of the economy â€” and the path towards a more 'normal' normal â€” is the vaccine,"" Prudential's Krosby wrote. ""This is crucial and will be the most important inflection point for the market â€” this is why during this earnings season it will be headlines regarding therapies and vaccines that will be guiding investors."" Renewed hopes for an effective therapy helped the S&P 500 close above its 50-day moving average for the first time since Feb. 21 on and gain more than 3% for the week by Friday's close. The index is up more than 19% over one month as the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to decelerate. Moderna spiked more than 15% on Friday after the biotech company announced that the federal government had approved $483 million in funding for its efforts to produce and distribute a vaccine. ""We're in a trading range, a sloppy trading range, until we have confidence that we've got a vaccine or a treatment that can guarantee that consumer behavior won't be severely impaired,"" said Dennis DeBusschere, head of Evercore ISI's portfolio strategy, who has been tracking the incremental drug developments closely for clients. ""As long as you don't have a strong treatment or vaccine, you're under the cloud of second-wave risk and people being more cautious about how they interact,"" the Evercore strategist said. He added that until such a time, restaurants, malls and other retailers that can't guarantee social distancing could be in for persistent financial headwinds. Trying to price in a treatment is tricky, DeBusschere said, depending on how much it would require of patients. More-involved treatments, such as a trip or two to a hospital for an intravenous remedy, could take time to roll out to the population and require a significant amount of effort. ""The destination's easier than the journey: It seems the odds of a vaccine in the next 12 to 18 months are relatively high as are the odds of an interim treatment to help bridge the gap,"" he said. Still, DeBusschere credited expectations of a pharmaceutical remedy for a significant portion of the market's rally since its bottom on March 23. ""I would say the vast majority of the move off the low is related to health-care developments,"" he said. ""Most people believe that we're going to get some sort of vaccine."" The race is most intense for a vaccine, a competition that thus far includes major drugmakers Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Moderna. 1)     Johnson & Johnson As one of the leading pharmaceutical companies working on a vaccine, Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday that it's aiming to produce between 600 million and 900 million doses of its own pending cure by the end of the first quarter of 2021 for emergency cases. J&J also said it has committed more than $1 billion of investment in partnership with the federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, to co-fund vaccine research. Company executives said that if Phase I trials scheduled for September go according to plan it could wind up producing 1 billion or more doses annually. ""We have very good early indicators that not only can we depend on this to be a safe vaccine base but also one that will ultimately be effective,"" J&J CEO Alex Gorsky told CNBC in March. 2)    Moderna Moderna was perhaps the first company to deliver the first experimental virus vaccine to U.S. government researchers when it shipped the maiden batch in February. The company said in late February that it expected to start a clinical trial of about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers by the end of April in an attempt to see whether two doses of the remedy are safe and effective in developing immunity. The U.S. government reinforced Moderna's research and development efforts with an additional $483 million in funding, which the company announced on Friday. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that the funding is particularly critical in aiding manufacturing efforts. ""Instead of waiting for the data and then scaling up with manufacturing process ... we can make as many doses as we can. We are doing both in parallel,"" he said. The company plans to hire up to 150 people to support the effort. Chairman Noubar Afeyan told CNBC earlier in April that the drug had entered Phase I trials and hoped to advance to Phase II by late spring or early summer. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a central White House health advisor and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Moderna's Phase I trial was launched at ""record speed."" 3)    Pfizer New York-based Pfizer is also working on a vaccine, which the drugmaker hopes to begin testing in patients in summer 2020. Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said earlier in April that the vaccine candidate works by restricting the virus's ability to replicate or expand. Pfizer had initially planned to begin clinical trials for its Covid-19 candidate by the end of the year, but it's moved up that timeline to start in the third quarter. On top of that effort, Pfizer is working with BioNTech SE of Germany to generate a vaccine based on cutting-edge gene-based technology. Pfizer expects trials for that vaccine to commence as early as the end of April. Though the monthslong hunt for a viable, effective drug candidate may appear slow to those unfamiliar with the health-care industry, Jefferies health-care strategist Jared Holz cautioned that the current forecasts represent breakneck speed. ""Typically, vaccines from start to finish may take as long as ten years to complete; here we have been talking about two years or less,"" he wrote in an email. ""The primary factor(s) aiding optimistic thinking are government authorities (including the FDA) intent to fast track the process in order to salvage the country/world from this epidemic."" ""Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer seem to be in the lead, so to speak,"" he added. ""In this scenario, given how dire, the first to market advantage could be pretty significant."" 4) Others Rockville, Maryland-based Novavax's vaccine candidate, dubbed NVX-CoV2373, neutralizes a protein ""spike"" that virus can induce in patients. The company said on April 8 that the vaccine candidate showed a robust immune response in the animals that it tested and that its phase 1 trial in about 130 adult humans should begin mid-May. Inovio Pharmaceuticals, meanwhile, said on April 6 that the Food and Drug Administration had accepted its vaccine candidate, INO-4800, setting the stage for phase 1 human trials. The company added that the phase 1 study will enroll up to 40 healthy adult volunteers in Philadelphia and that each participant will receive two doses of INO-4800 four weeks apart. Initial immune responses and safety data from the study are expected by late summer. There's also a fierce competition to develop and roll out therapies for those suffering with Covid-19 within the next year. A few of the largest companies working on treatments include Gilead Sciences, Eli Lilly and a partnership between Regeneron and Sanofi. 1)     Gilead Sciences Gilead drug remdesivir continues to show promising results in small groups of patients, the latest detailed in the aforementioned study at the University of Chicago. In addition to those findings, the company said on April 10 that a cohort of 53 patients with severe cases of Covid-19 received the treatment through the ""compassionate use"" program and that a majority of those treated ""demonstrated clinical improvement and no new safety signals were identified."" Though Gilead has repeatedly cautioned that more rigorous studies need to be conducted before naming remdesivir a treatment, the promising early results have both fueled unprecedented demand for the drug and the company to ramp production. It aims to produce enough doses to provide treatments to more than 500,000 patients by October and another 500,000 by the end of 2020. The drugmaker said on April 4 that it had 1.5 million individual doses on hand, enough to supply more than 140,000 patients. 2)    Regeneron and Sanofi Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and French multinational pharmaceutical company Sanofi are focused on clinical trials to see whether their arthritis drug, Kevzara, could treat Covid-19 symptoms. The research seeks to determine whether a class of drugs already on the market to treat immune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis could also be taken to mitigate damage to the lungs caused by the immune system's overreaction to the virus that causes Covid-19. Some doctors think that drugs that can suppress the immune system might be helpful for limiting the body's destructive response to the novel coronavirus. The partnership initiated trials in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada, Russia and the United States. Regeneron said last month that U.S. trials would begin in New York and that the Phase II/III trial was expected to enroll up to 400 patients. 3)    Eli Lilly Eli Lilly is working with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to see if its own FDA-approved rheumatoid arthritis drug could serve as another option in the arsenal for health-care providers. The company said Friday that it's agreed to investigate whether baricitinib could prove an effective and safe treatment for hospitalized patients diagnosed with Covid-19. The study, which is slated to begin in the U.S. this month, will later be expanded to Europe and Asia with results expected by the end of June. The company theorizes that baricitinib's anti-inflammatory effects could curb the body's reaction to the virus. ""Lilly is moving at top speed and using all available resources to help fight this pandemic,"" Daniel Skovronsky, Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer, said on April 10. 4) Others There are also a number of other possible antiviral remedies in the works, including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two generic anti-malarial drugs. Proven to work in treating Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (like those being tested by Regeneron, Sanofi and Eli Lilly), President Donald Trump has trumpeted hydroxychloroquine as a potential ""game changer"" in the nationwide fight against the coronavirus. Researchers at NYU Langone launched one of the largest formal studies in the U.S. on March 24 to assess the drug and aims to test 2,000 adults who have been in close contact with confirmed Covid patients. But chloroquine (from which hydroxychloroquine is derived) can have serious side effects such as muscle weakness and heart arrhythmia. A small study in Brazil was halted this month for safety reasons after coronavirus patients taking chloroquine developed arrhythmia, including some who died.

127,A ‘High-Level Exercise’ Conducted 3 Months Ago Showed That A Coronavirus Pandemic Could Kill 65 Million People,Michael Snyder,"Just over three months ago, a “high-level pandemic exercise” entitled “Event 201” was held in New York City.  On October 18th the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in conjunction with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, brought together “15 leaders of business, government, and public health” to simulate a scenario in which a coronavirus pandemic was ravaging the planet.  The current coronavirus outbreak that originated in China did not begin until December, and so at that time it was supposedly just a hypothetical exercise.  The following comes from the official page for this event…

The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. The exercise illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences. I find it quite interesting that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was involved, because they are also fiAnonymouscial backers of the institute that was granted a U.S. patent for “an attenuated coronavirus” in November 2018.

It appears that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been quite interested in the threat posed by coronaviruses for quite some time.

Eric Toner, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, spearheaded putting “Event 201” together.  In his scenario, a coronavirus outbreak had begun on Brazil’s pig farms…

Toner’s simulation imagined a fictional virus called CAPS. The analysis, part of a collaboration with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, looked at what would happen if a pandemic originated in Brazil’s pig farms.

Even though the outbreak was quite limited at first, Toner’s scenario ultimately showed that a coronavirus pandemic could kill 65 million people…

The pretend outbreak started small: Farmers began coming down with symptoms that resembled the flu or pneumonia. From there, the virus spread to crowded and impoverished urban neighborhoods in South America.

Flights were canceled, and travel bookings dipped by 45%. People disseminated false information on social media.

After six months, the virus had spread around the globe. A year later, it had killed 65 million people. Let us certainly hope that this current outbreak does not evolve into that sort of a nightmare.

According to Reuters, there are now more than 800 confirmed cases, and the death toll has shot up to 25…

China confirmed 830 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of Jan. 23, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 25, the National Health Commission said on Friday.

But many are skeptical that the official figures are accurate.  Because the images coming out of Wuhan are extremely alarming…

Disturbing images of Wuhan residents dropping unresponsive to the floor have emerged on Instagram following the diseased Chinese city’s coronavirus lockdown.

Wuhan has been branded a “zombieland” by frantic locals after Chinese authorities told residents they are not allowed to leave yesterday morning.

Pictures from inside the city paint an apocalyptic picture as medics patrol in hazmat suits and gas masks.

Over the past 48 hours, numerous videos have been posted on social media that supposedly show violently sick people that have literally collapsed in the streets of Wuhan.  Here is just one example. And in another video, hundreds of mask-wearing Chinese citizens are crammed into the hallways of a hospital in Wuhan as they wait to see a doctor. This is something that I wrote about yesterday, and even though I documented my claims, I don’t think that a lot of people believed me.

In fact, when I told my wife what was happening at the hospitals even she didn’t believe me at first.

But this is actually happening, and one video from a Wuhan hospital even shows a patient that collapsed on the ground as he waited to see a doctor… If people are literally dropping where they stand, that would seem to indicate that we aren’t being told the full truth about this virus. Chinese authorities are trying to keep everyone calm, but they are definitely treating this like it is no ordinary outbreak.  For example, one airline passenger that was suspected of having the virus was actually “wheeled out of an airport in a quarantine box”…

Footage has emerged showing an airline passenger with suspected SARS-like coronavirus being wheeled out of an airport in a quarantine box.

The man inside the box is wearing a protective suit, a mask and gloves after he reportedly showed possible symptoms, including a fever, during screening and was isolated from other travellers.

The box is surrounded by staff wearing blue masks as it is wheeled to a waiting ambulance outside a terminal at the airport in Fuzhou in south-eastern China.

The whole world was stunned when it was announced that the entire city of Wuhan would be facing a quarantine, but now seven other Chinese cities are also being locked down.

In addition, big cities all over China are canceling festivities for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday…

Major Chinese cities, including Beijing and quarantine-blocked Wuhan, banned all large gatherings over the coming Lunar New Year festival, the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar, in an expanding effort to contain a rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak.

The announcement Thursday came as authorities expanded travel restrictions imposed on Wuhan to surrounding municipalities, shutting down travel networks and attempting to quarantine about 25 million people – more than the population of Florida.

We have never seen anything like this before in the entire modern history of China.

Would Chinese officials really take such dramatic measures if the threat was not real?

Of course here in the United States the CDC is assuring us that we don’t have anything to be concerned about…

“We don’t want the American public to be worried about this because their risk is low,” says Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “On the other hand, we are taking this very seriously and are dealing very closely with Chinese authorities.”

Hopefully they are correct, and hopefully this outbreak will blow over sooner rather than later.

But a virologist that played a key role in identifying SARS in 2003 insists that what we have seen so far is just the beginning…

“A bigger outbreak is certain,” said Guan Yi, a virologist who helped identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. He estimated – “conservatively,” he said – that this outbreak could be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic because that virus was transmitted by only a few “super spreaders” in a more defined part of the country.

“We have passed through the ‘golden period’ for prevention and control,” he told Caixin magazine from self-imposed quarantine after visiting Wuhan. “What’s more, we’ve got the holiday traffic rush and a dereliction of duty from certain officials.”

And if that wasn’t enough to send a chill down your spine, just check out what else he had to say…

“I’ve seen it all: bird flu, SARS, influenza A, swine fever and the rest. But the Wuhan pneumonia makes me feel extremely powerless,” he told Caixin. “Most of the past epidemics were controllable, but this time, I’m petrified.”

The next week or two will be an absolutely critical time.

If authorities are able to stop the number of cases from rising at an exponential rate, and if there are able to keep it mostly confined to just a few areas of China, we may have a chance to prevent a global pandemic.

But if not, we may be facing a worst case scenario.

And according to “Event 201”, a worst case scenario could potentially mean tens of millions of dead people.",1,
42,"Ocasio-Cortez: ‘If Food Runs Scarce, It’s Okay To Eat Pets'",admin,"According to her independent study using common-core mathematics and crayons, the average American citizen with one dog or cat would save up to 400 dollers by simply letting Krytp or Streaky off their leashes and into their mouths, as tragic as it may seem.

460,Japan airlines keep most domestic flights despite few takers for seats - Reuters,"Maki Shiraki, Tim Kelly","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s top airlines are operating a majority of their domestic capacity even though the coronavirus outbreak has left seats on flights mostly empty, amid a lack of clear government directives on the functioning of transport infrastructure in the crisis. ANA Holdings Inc (9202.T) and Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) (9201.T), Japanâ€™s two biggest airlines, have cut around 90% of international flights but left their domestic networks relatively intact, industry data showed. The two normally fly around 800 or more domestic flights daily. They are currently flying around two-thirds of capacity with 10% of the usual demand, according to the airlines. That is despite Japan declaring a one-month state of emergency in major cities on April 7 which was expanded on Thursday to include the entire country. The move is set to add further financial strain on the Japanese carriers. Their peers in India, Thailand and the Philippines have grounded all domestic flights under government orders, while those in Australia and New Zealand are flying less than 5% of their normal schedules due to travel restrictions and reduced demand. Japan has not restricted domestic travel, and authorities in Tokyo and other big cities are only requesting people to stay in and asking bars and restaurants to temporarily close without penalty. â€œThe government has declared an emergency, but hasnâ€™t asked the airlines to reduce flights, rather they want to maintain the transport infrastructure,â€ said a person familiar with operations at the airlines, who was not authorised to talk to media. â€œSome planes are flying with less than 10 passengers, but we feel we need to keep that transport infrastructure,â€ the person added. An official at the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, which oversees the carriers, described it as â€œbusiness as usualâ€, with the airlines setting schedules based on business conditions. The government only requires them to offer refunds or new bookings to passengers affected by cancellations, he said. Neither carrier is government owned, but ties with regulators are close, with officials and politicians willing to extend financial help in troubled times to support a domestic aviation network that connects an island archipelago stretching almost 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles). In a stimulus package equivalent to a fifth of Japanâ€™s annual GDP, Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s government has promised financial support for the carriers, although it has yet to say how much. The Scheduled Airlines Association of Japan, which represents ANA, JAL and 17 others, estimates that the pandemic will cost its members some 500 billion yen ($4.64 billion) in lost revenue by the end of May. Over a year that deficit could balloon to 2 trillion yen, the industry lobby group predicts. ANA has asked commercial lenders and the state-run Development Bank of Japan for 400 billion yen in aid, as it burns through cash during the crisis. â€œI expect current cuts to operations to continue,â€ said a second airline industry source familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified. If the coronavirus downturn lasts a year ANA will need at least 1.3 trillion yen, the source said. An ANA spokeswoman said the carrier would consider further cuts to domestic flights, but because it was a necessary form of transportation it would continue to cooperate in maintaining basic services. â€œThe crucial question is whether there is going to be at least a partial recovery in operations by the summer,â€ said Kazuma Ogino, a credit analyst at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.

20,"9 Simulations, Drills and Laws that Planned and Prepared for the Coronavirus",Makia Freeman,"They planned and prepared for the coronavirus decades in advance. The infrastructure has been clearly set up over the last 2+ decades to ensure that when Operation Coronavirus went live, all the pieces would be in place to bamboozle and enslave people, forcing them into a place where they would gladly accept or beg for mass vaccination. Operation Coronavirus resembles a false flag op in many ways. One similarity is that it was meticulously planned for long in advance. Astute readers may notice another similarity: the phenomenon of the drill “going live” (we are in a “live exercise” as Mike Pompeo said). This crops up in so many false flag attacks, i.e. when the exact scenario being trained and prepared for in an exercise occurs in the real world. Below is a list of various simulations, drills, exercises, papers, scenarios and laws that all in some way anticipated and prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. The NWO (New World Order) ruling class and the USG (US Government) have been carrying out drills or simulations for pandemics for a long time. In June 2001, they conducted an operation known as Dark Winter which simulated a biowarfare anthrax attack. By a strange coincidence, such an anthrax attack actually happened after 9/11. By another strange coincidence, Johns Hopkins was involved, and they also just happened to be involved in Event 201 (see below). On this website, the Johns Hopkins’ Center for Health Security summarizes Dark Winter as an exercise which “portrayed a fictional scenario depicting a covert smallpox attack on US citizens. The scenario is set in 3 successive NSC meetings that take place over 2 weeks. The exercise was held at Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, DC.” Johns Hopkins is responsible for the ‘official’ (and inflated) COVID-19 case and death count map.

Whitney Webb’s piece on Dark Winter points out how “government insiders had foreknowledge of the Covid-19 crisis on a scale that, thus far, has gone unreported and that those same insiders are now manipulating the government’s response and public panic in order to reap record profits and gain unprecedented power for themselves.” She writes:

Upon further investigation, key leaders of both Event 201 and Crimson Contagion, not only have deep and longstanding ties to U.S. Intelligence and the U.S. Department of Defense, they were all previously involved in that same June 2001 exercise, Dark Winter. Some of these same individuals would also play a role in the FBI’s “sabotaged” investigation into the subsequent Anthrax attacks and are now handling major aspects of the U.S. government’s response to the Covid-19 crisis. One of those individuals, Robert Kadlec, was recently put in charge of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) entire Covid-19 response efforts, despite the fact that he was recently and directly responsible for actions that needlessly infected Americans with Covid-19.

Other major players in Dark Winter are now key drivers behind the “biodefense” mass surveillance programs currently being promoted as a technological solution to Covid-19’s spread, despite evidence that such programs actually worsen pandemic outbreaks. Others still have close connections to the insider trading that recently occurred among a select group of U.S. Senators regarding the economic impact of Covid-19 and are set to personally profit from lucrative contracts to develop not just one, but the majority, of experimental Covid-19 treatments and vaccines currently under development by U.S. companies.

Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (Drafted 2001)
MSEHPA (Model State Emergency Health Powers Act) is a public health act originally drafted by the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) with the intention of getting the 50 US states to enact similar legislation. It included sweeping and draconian legislation – including forced vaccination – as a response to epidemics, pandemics and bioterrorism. It is crucial to realize that the CDC owns patents on several vaccines so functions as a giant vaccine company as a much as (or even more so than) a governmental agency. The ACLU writes:

The Act lets a governor declare a state of emergency unilaterally and without judicial oversight, fails to provide modern due process procedures for quarantine and other emergency powers, it lacks adequate compensation for seizure of assets, and contains no checks on the power to order forced treatment and vaccination … The act includes an overbroad definition of “public health emergency” that sweeps in HIV, AIDS, and other diseases that clearly do not justify quarantine, forced treatment, or any of the other broad emergency authorities that would be granted under the Act … The Act requires the disclosure of massive amounts of personally identifiable health information to public health authorities, without requiring basic privacy protections …

According to Wikipedia:

The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons claimed that the draft used sweeping language to the extent that it “could turn governors into dictators” since the MSEHPA gave governors the authority to declare public health emergencies, and afterward force vaccinations on the general public without their informed consent. The deployment of state National Guards could be used to administer the vaccines or substances. Legal liabilities for drug companies which manufactured the vaccines and/or substances were removed.

As of 2007, 33 states had introduced 133 legislative bills or resolutions that were based upon or featured provisions related to the articles or sections of the act. Of these, 48 had passed … As of August 1, 2011, forty states have passed various forms of MSEHPA legislation.

The Project BioShield Act (2004)
The Project Bioshield Act was an act passed by the United States Congress in 2004 calling for $5.6 billion for purchasing vaccines that would be used in the event of a bioterrorist attack. It was passed in the years following 9/11 and the Dark Winter-predicted anthrax attack, in days of fear over WMDs, chemical weapons, biological weapons and more. This law is classic problem-reaction-solution stuff, justifying all sorts of Big Pharma interventions by playing off the fear of the day. It was basically a 10-year, almost $6 billion plan for the USG to create and produce vaccines and treatments for anthrax, ebola, the plague and other potential bioterrorism agents. This FAS article reports:

This law has three main provisions: (1) relaxing procedures for some CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear] terrorism-related spending, including hiring and awarding research grants; (2) guaranteeing a federal government market for new CBRN medical countermeasures; and (3) permitting emergency use of unapproved countermeasures. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has used each of these authorities. The HHS used expedited review authorities to approve grants relating to developing treatments for radiation exposure and used the authority to guarantee a government market to obligate approximately $2.3 billion to acquire countermeasures against anthrax, botulism, radiation, and smallpox. The HHS has also employed the emergency use authority several times including allowing young children with H1N1 “swine flu” to receive specific antiviral drugs.

The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (2005)
Where would Big Pharma be without their favorite politicians constantly passing laws to legally protect them from liability arising from their toxic products? In 1986, the US Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act which set up special courts for the vaccine-damaged. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, codified at 42 USC §247d-6d, gives the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the power to waive legal liability for corporations producing “covered countermeasures” (i.e. vaccines) in the case of a public health emergency. A PREP Act Declaration (effective February 4th 2020) was issued to provide liability immunity for activities related to medical countermeasures against COVID-19.

Lock Step (Rockefeller Foundation Paper, 2010)
As I covered in an earlier article 2010 Rockefeller Foundation Paper and The New Normal, a Rockefeller Foundation paper analyzed a scenario called “Lock Step” (a phrase with negative overtones and suggestive of soldiers, military and fascism) where they outlined governmental responses to a rapidly emerging viral pandemic. The paper outlined a scenario where a pandemic has hit, and the governments of the world use it to expand their authority and increase their grip on power. Although the authors of the paper try to claim they are just imagining not predicting the future, given the immense role of the Rockefeller family bloodline and Rockefeller Foundation in pushing the NWO Global Government, this is a ruse to cover their active planning for crisis scenarios that they know will happen. It is also a fine example of predictive programming.

USNORTHCOM Branch Plan 3560 (January 2017)
This unclassified 2017 US Military paper from NORTHCOM warned of a possible “novel influenza disease” that could strike the US and leave it unprepared. It outlines a planned and coordinated response to an infectious disease outbreak involving numerous governmental agencies, such as DHS, FEMA, USDA, HHS and even NGOs like USAID.

Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act (2017)
Similar to section 817 of the Patriot Act (the Expansion of the Biological Weapons Statute which gave the USG immunity from violating its own biological weapons laws), this act reorganizes the Department of Homeland Security’s National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) into a new agency: the Critical Infrastructure and Cyber Security Agency. Activist Post reporter Janet Phelan wrote that this new act further cemented the USG’s “ability to covertly deploy through water, which is defined as critical infrastructure, any biological or chemical agent and claim not only immunity but also deny any legal right to protest this through the legal system. Given the covert nature of this delivery system, it is to be expected that the US would claim that the resultant mass deaths to be attributable to a naturally occurring pandemic.”

Crimson Contagion (August 2019)
In 2019, there were 2 exercises conducted in the second half of the year that both happened to simulate a situation where a viral pandemic broke out and made its way to the US! The first one, that finished in August 2019, was called Crimson Contagion and was run by the USG. The full name was Crimson Contagion 2019 Functional Exercise. In it, the USG prophetically simulated a viral outbreak that began in China and landed in Chicago, infecting 110 million Americans. The conclusion of the ‘simulation’ was that the Federal Government lacked the funds, coordination and resources to effectively combat the virus, a finding which justifies even greater spending on pandemic preparedness. The simulation was led by former Air Force physician Robert Kadlec (mentioned above) who was also involved in Dark Winter … and now COVID-19. What another amazing coincidence.

Event 201 (October 2019)
It’s the event everyone is talking about! On October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – A Global Pandemic Exercise which was a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic that broke out in Brazil and came to the USA. Just another coincidence of course. Attendees included the US CDC, the Chinese CDC, WEF (in partnership with the WHO), Big Pharma reps (e.g. Johnson and Johnson) and others. Event 201 was run by NWO frontman Bill Gates, who has used his fortune to push GMOs and vaccines all over the world. Gates has been very visible during this pandemic using MSM platforms to preach the need for mandatory vaccines and possible “digital certificates” or “immunity passports” which people would need to travel again after the lockdown.

Other Foreknowledge Showing Some Were Prepared for the Coronavirus – Imminently
Other foreknowledge outside of the above 9 points includes the US senators who dumped stocks right before the outbreak began (between late January and February 14th), as well as the hundreds of CEOs who unexpectedly quit around January 2020. Are we meant to believe that was all this just lucky timing? Why did USG, on September 30th 2019, end the pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses, just months before the coronavirus crisis started in China? Just as there was clear 9/11 foreknowledge, so too is there clear and unmistakable coronavirus foreknowledge.

Clearly, They Prepared for the Coronavirus
So all in all, Operation Coronavirus is a carefully engineered crisis which has been planned at least 2 decades in advance, if not longer. The psychopathic social engineers who run the world have AI supercomputers to test all scenarios and permutations of their ideas, just like plugging in variables into an algebraic equation. One thing is for sure: this operation has many phases and possibilities and we are just in the opening scene of what is to come. The plan is to rapidly accelerate as many NWO agendas as possible while people are still ignorant and afraid. To what extent they succeed will depend on how many people can get out of fear, educate themselves, unite and stand in the true sovereign power, in the knowledge of their inherent birthright of freedom.",1,
114,Coronavirus was produced in a laboratory: Former CIA intel officer,Anonymous,"A former American counter-terrorism specialist and military intelligence officer of the CIA has said that the “Coronavirus did not occur naturally through mutation but rather was produced in a laboratory, possibly as a biological warfare agent.”

Since the novel coronavirus outbreak began in China last December, it has infected more than 90,000 people globally and killed more than 3,000. The majority of cases and deaths remain in mainland China.

The death toll from the coronavirus in Iran, which has one of the highest numbers outside China, stood at 107, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said Thursday.

“Several reports suggest that there are components of the virus that are related to HIV that could not have occurred naturally. If it is correct that the virus had either been developed or even produced to be weaponized it would further suggest that its escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology Lab and into the animal and human population could have been accidental. Technicians who work in such environments are aware that “leaks” from laboratories occur frequently,” Philip Giraldi wrote in an article published by the Strategic Culture Foundation on Thursday.

“There is, of course and inevitably, another theory. There has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has been constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global competitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and economic domiAnonymousce, it might be possible that Washington has created and unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing’s growing economy and military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to believe that even the Trump White House would do something so reckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior,” he said.

“In 2005-9 the American and Israeli governments secretly developed a computer virus called Stuxnet, which was intended to damage the control and operating systems of Iranian computers being used in that country’s nuclear research program. Admittedly Stuxnet was intended to damage computers, not to infect or kill human beings, but concerns that it would propagate and move to infect computers outside Iran proved to be accurate as it spread to thousands of PCs outside Iran, in countries as far flung as China, Germany, Kazakhstan and Indonesia,” he added.

“If one even considers it possible that the United States had a hand in creating the coronavirus at what remains of its once extensive biological weapons research center in Ft Detrick Maryland, it is very likely that Israel was a partner in the project. Helping to develop the virus would also explain how Israeli scientists have been able to claim success at creating a vaccine so quickly, possibly because the virus and a treatment for it were developed simultaneously,” he noted. Israeli scientists have claimed to be close to developing a vaccine for coronavirus that could be available in about 90 days, saying they have developed an effective vaccine against avian coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), which is to be adapted soon and create a human vaccine against COVID-19.",1,
206,"Is This The Man Behind The Global Coronavirus Pandemic?
",Tyler Durden,"In light of growing speculation, most of it within less than official circles, that the official theory for the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, namely because someone ate bat soup at a Wuhan seafood and animal market...

... is a fabricated farce, and that the real reason behind the viral spread is because a weaponized version of the coronavirus (one which may have originally been obtained from Canada), was released by Wuhan's Institute of Virology (accidentally or not), a top, level-4 biohazard lab which was studying ""the world's most dangerous pathogens"", perhaps it would be a good idea for the same Wuhan Institute of Virology to remove the following ""help wanted"" notice, posted on November 18, 2019, according to which the institute is seeking to hire one or two post-doc fellows, who will use ""bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.""

The right candidate will: Have obtained or is about to obtain a PhD in life science/biomedical related fields;
Have a reliable and rigorous work style, with strong independent scientific research ability and teamwork spirit;
Have strong English communication and writing skills, have research papers published in the international mainstream academic journals
Have a cell biology, immunology, genomics and other relevant background experience is preferred;
The full job posting, which can still be found on the Wuhan Institute of Virology website can be found here (and screengrabbed below as it will be gone within a few hours). Why is this notable? Because as it turns out, this is a job posting for the lab of Dr. Peng Zhou (周鹏), Ph.D., a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Leader of the Bat Virus Infection and Immunization Group. Some more on Zhou's background from the Institute (google translated): He received his PhD in Wuhan Virus Research Institute in 2010 and has worked on bat virus and immunology in Australia and Singapore. In 2009 , he took the lead in starting the research on the immune mechanism of bat long-term carrying and transmitting virus in the world. So far, he has published more than 30 SCI articles, including the first and corresponding author's Nature , Cell Host Microbe and PNAS . At present, research on bat virus and immunology is continuing, and it has received support from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

Which brings us to the punchline: courtesy of the Wuhan institute of virology, here is a press release from Dr. Zhou's lab titled ""How bats carry viruses without getting sick"":

Bats are known to harbor highly pathogenic viruses like Ebola, Marburg, Hendra, Nipah, and SARS-CoV, and yet they do not show clinical signs of disease. In a paper published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe on February 22, scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China find that in bats, an antiviral immune pathway called the STING-interferon pathway is dampened, and bats can maintain just enough defense against illness without triggering a heightened immune reaction.

""We believe there is a balance between bats and the pathogens they carry,"" says senior author Peng Zhou. ""This work demonstrated that in order to maintain a balance with viruses, bats may have evolved to dampen certain pathways.""

In humans and other mammals, an immune-based over-response to one of these and other pathogenic viruses can trigger severe illness. For example, in humans, an activated STING pathway is linked with severe autoimmune diseases.

""In human history, we have been chasing infectious diseases one after another,"" says Zhou, ""but bats appear to be a 'super-mammal' to these deadly viruses."" By identifying a weakened but not defunct STING pathway, researchers have some new insight into how bats fine-tune antiviral defenses to balance an effective, but not an overt, response against viruses.

The authors hypothesize that this defense strategy evolved as part of three interconnected features of bat biology: they are flying mammals, have a long lifespan, and host a large viral reservoir.

""Adaptation to flight likely caused positive selection of multiple bat innate immune and DNA damage repair genes,"" Zhou says. These adaptations may have shaped certain antiviral pathways (STING, interferon, and others) to make them good viral reservoir hosts and achieve a tolerable balance.""

And just in case, here is a google-translated press release from Jan 18, 2019 describing the achievements of Dr. Peng Zhou:

Wuhan has the first person in the global bat immunity research: ""I rushed forward with a sword""

Changjiang Daily FiAnonymouscial Media May 4 hearing last month as they tied for first author made a ""natural"", in recent years, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan virus after 80 young researchers Zhou Peng has been in the ""natural"", ""American Academy of Sciences ”And other international authoritative magazines published 28 papers, becoming academic stars. In an interview with reporters recently, he introduced that young scientists do not rely on genius to hold, but rely on ""super confident"".

It is understood that Zhou Peng is the pioneer of global bat immune system research. ""Bats carry viruses but do not get sick. They have not been researched by scientists before, and certainly have specificity different from other species, but this is like you know the beginning and Ending without knowing how the story happened. "" After more than 10 years of research, Zhou Peng discovered that an antiviral immune channel called ""interferon gene-stimulating protein-interferon"" in the bat's body was inhibited, so that the bat could just resist the disease without triggering a strong immune response. The results were published in Cells, Hosts and Microorganisms, which aroused the attention of the academic community.

Zhou Peng, a student of undergraduate bioengineering, experienced SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in his junior year, which made him interested in the virus: ""A small virus makes the world mess."" He was admitted to the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the postgraduate level, and studied under Shi Zhengli, a bat expert. Focusing on the virus carried by the bat, then I was wondering if the bat's immune system is special. ""

After graduating from the PhD, he entered the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and became the first person in the global bat immunity research. ""I went through 4 years of trial and error, groped in the dark, and hit the South Wall numerous times. I still remember a 'darkest moment' 'In the local cold winter, I was holding the frostbite knee, sitting at the beach, and asking myself why this was the case.'

He began to learn Australian jokes and inspired himself. In 2016, during postdoctoral studies at Duke University-National University of Singapore Medical School, he was concerned that a certain interferon in bats is always maintained at a high level. This paper became the cover article of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ""Bat Immunity ""This door was opened, and more and more people in the world are paying attention to this field."" Our generation, when we were in college, watched ""The Forrest Gump"" and ""Redemption of Shawshank"" and taught us stupidity and perseverance. I I feel like I am carrying a sword and rushing forward. ""

After returning to China in 2016, Zhou Peng returned to his alma mater to become a little-known young researcher. ""In the long run, bats carry the virus without getting sick. It is hoped that humans can learn how to fight the virus, but this is still far from industrialization. Far, the road ahead is long, and we must remain 'super confident' and continue to move forward. ""(Reporter Li Jia correspondent Chen teased Li Li intern Luo Yameng) And here is the man, the myth, the bat-god himself: Peng Zhou.

o to summarize:

One of China's top virology and immunology experts was and still works at China's top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called the real Umbrella Corp.
Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world.
His primary field of study is researching how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick.
He was genetically engineering various immune pathways (such as the STING pathway in bats) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug.
As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; these are ""superbug"" Coronavirus strains, which are not resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild.
As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections.
Peng's work on virology and bat immunology has received support from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology. Something tells us, if anyone wants to find out what really caused the coronavirus pandemic that has infected thousands of people in China and around the globe, they should probably pay Dr. Peng a visit.

On March 24, a day after Gov. Mike DeWine's stay-at-home order was enacted, David Coury was in the hospital. The 54-year-old needed surgery to remove cancer from his tongue. ""The day I was in there was the height of fear, so to speak, or the unknown of what was going on,"" Coury told CNN. ""I just looked around, and it was amazing to me to see all of these people going about their business -- carefully -- but still they were taking care of everybody else, including me,"" he said. ""It just moved me."" Coury's brother-in-law, Ghazi Faddoul, owns multiple Subway franchises in Northeast Ohio. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, one of his stores has closed and the others are operating with extremely shortened schedules, some selling less than $50 a day. Five thousand Subway sandwiches were donated to University Hospital staff in Cleveland, Ohio. Read More ""You get to the other side of cancer as well as I did, it was sort of easy,"" he said. ""He needed help."" The purchase of the 5,000 sandwiches would benefit Faddoul as well as hospital workers.

""It's important that our community rallies together and supports one another during these unprecedented times."" Coury's cancer was removed successfully, his recovery went well, and he needs no further treatments. ""If I didn't have cancer, by the way, I'd have done the same thing,"" Coury said. Through separate donations, Faddoul's Subway locations provided more than 500 meals to nursing homes and homeless shelters. They expect to deliver another 1,000 meals to the hospital next week.",0,
150,Corona – The Aftermath,Peter Koenig,"What will be next? Is a question on many people’s minds. Very likely the world will never be the same again. That might be god, or not so good, depending on how we look at this disastrous, “pandemic” which by all serious accounts does not deserve the term pandemic, that was unwittingly given to the MERS-2-CoV, or 2019-nCoV, renamed by WHO to COVID-19. In mid-February Dr. Tedros, WHO’s Director General called it a pandemic. This decision was already taken by the WEF (World Economic Forum) in Davos, from20 -24 January 2020, when the total COVID19 cases outside of China were recorded by WHO as 150. This was a first indication that there was something not quite right, that there is another agenda behind the “outbreak” of the COVID19 disease.

On February 28, in a peer-reviewed article in the highly reputed New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the 27 institutes and centers that make up the US National Institutes of Health – NIH), likened COVID19 to a stronger than usual common flu:

If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.

In the meantime, other high-ranking scientist, microbiologists and medical doctors from all over the world, are questioning the draconian worldwide shutdown because of the corona virus. They all say, these measures are not necessary to contain a pandemic of this relatively low magnitude, i.e. a fatality rate of about 0.1%. Even in Italy, if the counting and accounting was done more carefully, more according to true statistical norms, the fatality rate would be perhaps 1%, or less. What the world is experiencing, resembles a well-planned worldwide declaration and implementation of Martial Law with socioeconomically disastrous consequences, far worse than the disease itself. Nobody moves. The economy comes to an almost standstill.

This begs the question, what is behind it, and what comes next?

***

Let’s first look at a not-so-good scenario. In the US job losses are currently reported at more than 10 million. Unemployment expected to rise to at least 35% within the next few weeks; bankruptcies will be spiraling out of control within a month or two – with a further domino effect on unemployment.

We may be looking at a complete collapse of our western economy, and growing misery- for the masses. – What will happen to these people, without jobs, without incomes, many of them may also lose their homes, as they will not be able to pay their mortgages or rents? – They may die from famine, diseases of all sorts, despair – the desired world population reduction that Bill Gates, Rockefeller and Co aspire. It may be part of and the beginning of their sinister eugenics plan.

The doomsday picture may continue as all the bankrupt small and medium size enterprises – including airlines, tourist industries – et al, will be bought up by huge monopolies, that already exist, Google, Amazon, AliBaba and more. Mergers of gigantic proportions may take place. It may be the last shift of capital from the bottom to the top in our era of civilization as we know it.

A global vaccination program with toxins and DNA-altering proteins contained in the injected immune-serum may be forced upon the surviving population. Included within the injection of vaccine may be a Anonymouso-chip, that people are not aware of, but that may be uploaded with all your personal data, from health records, to traffic violations, to your bank account – so that you can be followed, surveyed and watched over – every step you take. And every dissenting view you voice will be recorded and listened to, and you may be punished by your money being confiscated or a drone may do away with you, depending on the gravity of the dissent. Yes, the implantation of a Anonymouso-chip is a reality.

An electronic digital one-world-currency system is planned and may be imposed – and your money, spending and savings may be controlled through the microchip in your body.

The poison in the forced-vaccines may also do their work. They may make you sterile, sick – and, eventually die. Especially, the elderly with a reduced immune system. They must go first. That’s part of the eugenics plan – that Rockefeller dreams of and his crony, Bill Gates, may implement with his insane and phanatic vaccination programs.  The elderly use up much too much of the social capital, health care, pensions, living space.

Those who survive, may pass on the deadly genome defects caused by the vaccines to their children – and they may eventually die or be deformed, or live with neurological damage- and pass the calamity on to the next generation – and the next.

Some of them, will selectively be cured. Induced mutations for cure are possible. Because the 0.01% elite (or less) needs some humans who can manage the Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that may eventually run every facet of your life, from cars, to refrigerators, to food manufacturing and delivery, as well as medication that you have to take. “They” – these nefarious evil creatures – create some Alpha and Beta type humans to control and supervise AI-beings and their activities, so the robots won’t run amok with the world – and with the all-powerful, but utterly deceptive and vulnerable elite. For the elite, the sadistic evil creatures, it must remain paradise. Actually, happiness for everybody is needed, to avoid social upheaval. We may become a society, resembling Aldhous Huxley’s “Brave New World”.

They, the Alphas and Betas, the upper echelons of the enslaved humanoids, have to make sure, that AI is not overrunning the elite, but will be kept under control.

Hydrocarbon energy, oil and gas, may no longer be an issue. The price will be adjusted to the needs of the monopolistic demands. A reduced population will be using less energy. And since most is run by 5G and later even more efficiently by 6G – already in the making, and since there is really no competition anymore among the top monopolies, energy will be flowing amply – no price war is necessary.

***

This is a doomsday scenario. One that Gates and his satanic cult would like to impose upon the world.

Now let’s look at a good scenario, one that we the people have the power to make good. First, no complex projection of this type can ever be modeled and implemented over time, because dynamics take over. The world is alive. Anything that is alive cannot be directed by linearism (modelling is linear), but is subject to the laws of dynamics.

Second, we, mankind are alive too, and we have the power to reverse this nefarious game plan of this evil cult that wants to dominate Mother Earth and all her creatures and the riches she hosts. It’s a question of waking up. And many people start seeing the light -perhaps in part because of this absurdity, this worldwide lockdown, this insanity of an endless thirst for power. Mother Earth is sick and tired of this abuse of the upper crust of society. She is stronger than the 0.01%. We, the people, can join Mother Earth, be on her side, and be safe.

People start seeing the thought of utter destruction behind this fake epidemic, or according to WHO’s highly questionable leadership, a pandemic – a fear-mongering pandemic. We might as well call the corona virus, Virus “F” – for Fear. And yes, people can die of fear. WHO is dancing to the tune of the powerful, of Bill Gates, the Rockefellers, the pharma giants – and the behind-the-door (invisible) WEF-politicians and bankers. All this, under the pretext of saving the world from the invisible corona virus, from a pandemic that isn’t.

***

We have enormous spiritual powers within us which we can mobilize to stem against the propaganda stream. In fact, the reason we are exposed to this type of ferocious propaganda, is precisely because the masters know about that strength of the human mind. And the way to immobilize it is through fear. That’s what’s happening.

The longer this pathetic and oppressive Martial Law situation lasts (yes, in many countries, even Europe, Martial Law has become the state of the affair), the more this inner power and conviction of Self, of us, Sovereign Selves that we are, will resurface in humanity and displace the fear – to become a force to stand up against the evil forces, stand up for justice and for human equality, for human dignity – and ultimately for solidarity and love.
Love is what makes us overcome this diabolical plan.

That is the scenario of hope and love. Endless hope is hoping to the end, then the end will never come. And as we hope and create endlessly, avoiding conflict, we see the light emerging from the dark – a harmonious flow of peaceful creation.",1,
215,"Global Capitalism, “World Government” and the Corona Crisis",Prof Michel Chossudovsky,"The World is being misled concerning the causes and consequences of the corona crisis.

The COVID-19 crisis is marked by a public health “emergency” under WHO auspices which is being used as a pretext and a  justification to triggering a Worldwide process of economic, social and political restructuring. 

Social engineering is being applied. Governments are pressured into extending the lockdown, despite its devastating economic and social consequences.

What is happening is unprecedented in World history. 

Prominent scientists support the lockdown without batting an eyelid, as a “solution” to a global health emergency.

Amply documented, the estimates of the COVID-19 disease including mortality are grossly manipulated. 

In turn, people are obeying their governments. Why? Because they are afraid? 

Causes versus solutions?

The closing down of national economies applied Worldwide will inevitably result in poverty, mass unemployment and an increase in mortality. It’s an act of economic warfare. 

Stage One: Trade War against China

On January  30, 2020 the WHO Director General determined that the coronavirus outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The decision was taken on the basis of 150 confirmed cases outside China, First cases of person to person transmission: 6 cases in the US, 3 cases in Canada, 2 in the UK.

The WHO Director General had the backing of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Pharma and the World Economic Forum (WEF). The decision for the WHO to declare a Global Emergency was taken on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland  (January 21-24).

One day later (January 31) following the launch of the WHO Global Emergency, The Trump administration announced that it will deny entry to foreign nationals “who have traveled in China in the last 14 days”. This immediately triggered a crisis in air transportation, China-US trade as well as the tourism industry. Italy followed suit, cancelling all flights to China on January 31.

The first stage was accompanied by the disruption of trade relations with China as well as a partial closedown of export manufacturing sector.

A campaign was immediately launched against China as well ethnic Chinese. The Economist reported that

“The coronavirus spreads racism against and among ethnic Chinese”

“Britain’s Chinese community faces racism over coronavirus outbreak”

According to the SCMP:

“Chinese communities overseas are increasingly facing racist abuse and discrimination amid the coronavirus outbreak. Some ethnic Chinese people living in the UK say they experienced growing hostility because of the deadly virus that originated in China.”

And this phenomenon is happening all over the U.S.

Stage Two: The Financial Crash Spearheaded by Fear and Stock Market Manipulation

A global financial crisis unfolded in the course of the month of February culminating in a dramatic collapse of stock market values as well as a major decline in the value of crude oil.

This collapse was manipulated. It was the object of insider trading and foreknowledge. The fear campaign played a key role in the implementation of the stock market crash. In February, roughly $6 trillion have been wiped off the value of stock markets Worldwide. Massive losses of personal savings (e.g. of average Americans) have occurred not to mention corporate failures and bankruptcies. It was a bonanza for institutional speculators including corporate hedge funds. The financial meltdown has led to sizeable transfers of money wealth into the pockets of a handful of financial institutions.

Stage Three: Lockdown, Confinement, Closing Down of  the Global Economy

The financial crash in February was immediately followed by the lockdown in early March. The lockdown and confinement supported by social engineering was instrumental in the restructuring of the global economy. Applied almost simultaneously in a large number countries, the lockdown has triggered the closing down of the national economy, coupled with the destabilization of trade, transport and investment activities.

The pandemic constitutes an act of economic warfare against humanity which has resulted in global poverty and mass unemployment.

Politicians are lying. Neither the lockdown nor the closing down of national economies constitute a solution to the public health crisis.

Who Controls the Politicians?

Why are politicians lying?

They are the political instruments of the financial establishment including the “Ultra-rich philanthropists”. Their task is to carry out the global economic restructuring project which consists in freezing economic activity Worldwide.

In the case of the Democrats in the US, they are largely concerned in opposing the reopening of the US economy as part of the 2020 election campaign. This opposition to reopening the national and global economies is supported by “Big Money”.

Is it opportunism or stupidity. In all major regions of the World, politicians have been instructed by powerful financial interests to retain the lockdown and prevent the re-opening of the national economy.

The fear campaign prevails. Social distancing is enforced. The economy is closed down.  Totalitarian measures are being imposed. According to Dr. Pascal Sacré

… in some countries, patients can leave hospital by agreeing to wear an electronic bracelet. This is only a sample of all the totalitarian measures planned or even already decided by our governments in favor of the coronavirus crisis. It goes much further, it’s limitless and it affects a good part of the world, if not the whole world.

The “Herding Instincts” of Politicians

Are corrupt governments acting like “police dogs” with “herding instincts” going after their sheep.

Is “the herd” too scared to go after their “government”?

The analogy may be simplistic but nonetheless considered relevant by psychologists.

“Some breeds of dogs [corrupt politicians] have herding instincts that can be brought out with the right training and encouragement [bribes]. …. teach your dog [political proxy] basic obedience and see if it [he, she] displays herding tendencies. … Always look for a trainer who uses reward-based training methods [bribes, personal gain, political support, accession to high office]” (How to Teach Your Dog to Herd)

But there is another dimension. Politicians in high office responsible for “convincing their herd” actually believe the lies which are being imposed upon them by higher authority.

The lie becomes the truth. Politicians endorse the consensus, they enforce “social engineering”, they believe in their own lies.



It’s Not an Epidemic, It’s An Operation

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  (slip of the tongue) tacitly admits in a somewhat contradictory statement that the COVID-19 is a “Live Exercise”, an “Operation”:

“This is not about retribution,… This matter is going forward — we are in a live exercise here to get this right.”

To which president Trump retorted “you should have told us”.

Those words will go down in history.",1,
145,"Italy overcomes peak of epidemic with Russian help, 2 thousand patients recovered in a day",Anonymous,"For a week now, Italy has continued to reduce the burden on local health facilities. This statement was made by the Director of the Department of Civil Defense of Italy, Angelo Borrelli.

Over the past day alone, about 2 thousand patients infected with coronavirus recovered on the Apennine Peninsula. Thus, the total number of people recovered amounted to almost 30.5 thousand.

The number of deaths over the past day was 579 cases. In addition, more than 98 thousand people continue to fight the disease. 18.8 thousand of them undergo treatment in a hospital. At the same time, 3.5 thousand Italians are in serious condition.

“According to reports, the burden on medical facilities continues to decline. This has been happening for a week”, – commented Angelo Borrelli.

As News Front previously reported, at the height of the epidemic, when Italy was abandoned by its “partners” in the European Union, Russia volunteered to help the republic. As soon as possible, military doctors, medical and nursing teams, as well as equipment for diagnosis and disinfection, were transferred to the Apennine Peninsula. Despite Western attempts to discredit Russian aid, it was it that allowed Italy to overcome the peak in the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19. ",1,

104,"Why Big Pharma, Fauci, and Bill Gates Want to Ban Hydroxychloroquine",Carole Hornsby Haynes,"“A Democratic Michigan state lawmaker has credited President Trump's publicizing of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine with saving her life after her health ""plummeted"" when she contracted coronavirus.
State Rep. Karen Whitsett of Detroit told ""The Ingraham Angle"" on Monday that if it wasn't for Trump pushing the drug through the Food and Drug Administration's approval process for off-label use and touting it repeatedly during his daily press briefings, she may not have made it through the terrible contagion....
When Whitsett did make it to the hospital, she found out about a state order prohibiting the use of hydroxychloroquine. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, under Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, had issued the order, only for the governor to retract it several days later.
‘I did have a difficult time, even that day, obtaining the medication because of an order that was put down in my state,’ said Whitsett. ‘And it was on that day so you can imagine how terrified I was that I had to beg and plead and go through a whole lot to try to get the medication.’ …..
‘If President Trump had not talked about this it wouldn't have been something that would be accessible for anyone to be able to get right now,’ she said, adding that within a few hours of taking her prescription, she was feeling much better.”
Original Commentary: April 3, 2020
A malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, is being used to treat COVID-19 worldwide with phenomenal success. Yet in America, it has been banned by governors and its effectiveness denied by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma.
Dr. Vladmir Zelenko, in an exclusive interview with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, discussed his 100 percent success with a cocktail of drugs to treat COVID-19 patients in New York. The drugs were hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin (Z-Pak - an antibiotic to treat secondary infections), and zinc sulfate. Out of 699 patients treated, none have died or been intubated (put on a ventilator) and only four were hospitalized. The shortness of breath was resolved within four to six hours after treatment. The cost? $20 over a period of 5 days with 100% success.
Months ago the high esteemed Dr. Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top five scientists on communicable diseases, conducted a study using hydroxychloroquine because of its success with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. The success of Raoult’s study was ignored by French health officials. However, in October 2019 the French minister quietly moved the low cost over the counter drug to the list of “controlled substances” which requires a prescription and is considerably more in cost.
With President Trump’s fast tracking the clinical testing of hydroxychloroquine, patients have already benefited. Symptomatic patients have tested negative within an average of 5-6 days. There should have been great joy throughout the land over this, yet Democrats, the media, and those who hate Trump have weaponized the drug.
Deep State director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci stated, “There are no proven safe and effective therapies for the coronavirus.” Ignoring the highly successful controlled study in France by Dr. Raoult, Fauci claimed, “We’re getting stories from people who have tried them, but they’ve tried them in trials that are not controlled.”
What’s even more telling about Fauci’s political agenda is his discouraging people from going to their doctors and requesting chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – a less toxic form of chloroquine.
Democrat Nevada, Michigan, and New York governors banned the use of Hydroxychloroquine with Michigan governor threatening professional consequences against doctors who prescribe it. Meanwhile, the FDA has approved hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.
Mainstream media, including the New York Times and Washington Post, continue to publish negative reports about the drug and downplay its effectiveness in treating the virus.
Fake news cannot stop the international excitement, however. Hydroxychloroquine is now being used worldwide as shown on a map from Dr. Raoult. A global survey of more than 6,000 doctors conducted reported that hydroxychloroquine is the most highly rated treatment against the deadly coronavirus.
In his interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, infectious disease specialist Dr. Stephen Smith, said his team has been treating everyone with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with incredible results. “No person who has received five days or more of the [drug] combination has been intubated,” As for the future of hydroxychloroquine, Dr. Smith exclaimed, “It’s an absolute game-changer...I think this is the beginning of the end of the pandemic.”
Americans should be alarmed by the fiAnonymouscial industry brief published on March 10 by Raymond James and Associates,
“If clinical data confirm the biological results, the novel coronavirus-associated disease will have become one of the simplest and cheapest to treat and prevent among infectious respiratory diseases.”
In a blunt statement about the lack of attention being given to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, the brief concluded,
“But chloroquine doesn’t directly benefit any stock, like GILD or REGN or ABBV, which is probably why it seems to be getting less attention.”
Corporations are driven to benefit their shareholders who will not benefit with a low-cost drug that cures the problem quickly.
Meanwhile under the watchful eye of Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is experimenting with a vaccine for the virus. Annual vaccinations of a hysterical American population, who are being told by Fauci to expect a recurrence of the virus in the fall, are far more lucrative than a low cost, quick cure.
Certainly the U.N.’s World Health Organization, Big Pharma, Bill Gates, Dr. Fauci, and the world global medical complex that manipulate world health for power and profit will try to stop the use of a generic low cost drug for fast treatment of COVID-19. Their solutions are quarantine, vaccines, and new drugs. WHO has praised China and South Korea for their draconian quarantine measures yet ignore their use of chloroquine as an effective treatment for coronavirus.
These New World Order proponents are on a vendetta to force vaccinations on the entire world population. Immunization is claimed as being the only way to achieve the 17 sustainability, freedom suppressing goals of the U.N. A corornavirus pandemic is a crisis made to order.",1,
349,UK cold weather: How to keep your home warm this weekend | Weather | News | Express.co.uk,Kaisha Langton," Britons are expecting a washout this weekend as parts of the UK are forecast to be battered by heavy rainfall and potentially thunder and lightning. Several flood alerts have been issued for parts of the South East, with temperatures dropping to as low as 2C in some areas. Express.co.uk has compiled a guide to help you keep your home warm this weekend. The Met Office forecast for this weekend indicates much of England and Wales will see cloudy and cool weather, with showery outbreaks of rain. These downpours will likely be heavy at first and should be patchy. Any bright spells could likely trigger a heavy shower. Northern areas will be fine with the best of the sunshine arriving in the west. The sunny weather will continue on Sunday, but the odd shower could still occur in the southwest. READ MORE: UK weather forecast: Britain faces rain deluge before sun returns   The south of England is likely to see intense showers later on Saturday, which could bring thunder and lightning. Forecasters predict up to 1.2 inches (30mm) of rainfall could hit some areas, prompting the Environment Agency to issue several flood alerts. The Environment Agency has issued the following 15 flood alerts for Saturday where flooding is possible:  The weekend is also predicted to bring more chilly weather, with some Britons set to wake up to frost. Saturday will see temperatures struggle to reach 10C in much of the country. However, there will be highs of 13C to 14C in the south and in the west of Scotland. Giving the latest forecast, a Met Office spokesman said there will be a ""significant north/south contrast in our weather"" on Saturday. The forecaster said: â€œA chilly start to Saturday with a touch of frost in places, otherwise a largely sunny day to come here north of around Cumbria. â€œFurther south a lot of low cloud, a gloomy day to come. ""Heavy rain early on generally petering out but remaining fairly chilly under that layer of cloud and in the easterly breeze further north ""In the far south temperatures will rise through the afternoon perhaps sparking a further heavy shower or two. But for most, it turns dry into Saturday night."" DON'T MISSBBC Weather: Thunderstorms and showers to batter Europe this weekend [INSIGHT]Comet ATLAS: Images reveal TWO fragments of Comet racing towards Sun [EXPLAINER]BBC Weather: Britons brace for heavy thunderstorms as balmy spell ends [FORECAST] Central heating can be expensive for many people, especially given many peopleâ€™s income has been affected by the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Moving your favourite pieces of furniture near to radiators can feel warmer, but it is actually best to move furniture away from radiators to allow for the heat to circulate. The sun is a free source of heat so it is best to open your curtains wide and allow the sun to warm rooms in your home. When it gets dark, close your curtains because it adds another layer of insulation and helps to keep rooms warm.  Around 25 percent of heat is lost through your roof, which can be drastically reduced by adding insulation throughout your loft. This can lead to you saving around Â£160 a year in heating bills. One of the easiest ways to keep warm without costing you any more money is to wear extra layers. But this also works if you have a hot water tank. Wrapping your hot water tank will keep the water warmer for longer and reduce your heating costs. Draught-proofing your home is an easy way to help you save on your heating bills. Fill the gaps around windows and doors with insulating tape to protect your home from chills. Wooden floors are aesthetically pleasing, but they can help heat leak out of rooms. Putting down a warm rug can help prevent heat escaping and ensure your feet remain warm. Cover a thin sheet of card with tinfoil and place it behind your radiator to reflect the heat back into your home. You should check that your radiators are heating right to the top and if they are not, you should bleed your radiator. Bleeding a radiator helps release the trapped air at the top, which can stop the hot water rising. Once you have finished using your oven for food, it can be beneficial to leave the door open to let this heat transfer to the kitchen.

223,The Farce and Diabolical Agenda of A “Universal Lockdown”,Peter Koenig,"First comes the farce, an (almost) universal government lie around the globe about a deadly virus, WHO named COVID-19. The decision for a global lockdown – literally for the collapse of the world economy – was already taken at the WEF conference in Davos, 21 – 24 January 2020. On January 30, WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). At that time, there were only 150 known COVID-19 cases outside of China. No reason whatsoever to declare a pandemic. On March 11, Dr. Tedros, DG of WHO converted the PHEIC into a pandemic. This gave the green light for the start if implementing “The Plan”.

The pandemic was needed as a pretext to halt and collapse the world economy and the underlying social fabric.

There is no coincidence. There were a number of preparatory events, all pointing into the direction of aworldwide monumental historic disaster. It started at least 10 years ago – probably considerably earlier – with the infamous 2010 Rockefeller Report, which painted the first phase of a monstrous Plan, called the “Lock Step” scenario. Among the last preparatory moves for the “pandemic” was Event 201, held in NYC on 18 October 2019.

The event was sponsored by the Johns Hopkins Center for Public Health, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the World Economic Forum (WEF), the club of the rich and powerful that meets every January in Davos, Switzerland. Participating were a number of pharmaceuticals (vaccine interest groups), as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s of the US and – of China.

One of the objectives of Event 201 was a computer simulation of a corona virus pandemic. The simulated virus was called SARS-2-nCoV, or later 2019-nCoV. The simulation results were disastrous, killing 65 million people in 18 months and plunging the stock market by more than 30% — causing untold unemployment and bankruptcies. Precisely the scenario of which we are now living the beginning.

The Lock Step scenario foresees a number of ghastly and disturbing events or components of The Plan to be implemented by the so called Agenda ID2020, a Bill Gates creation, fully integrated into the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) – target date for completion – 2030 (also called Agenda 2030, the hidden agenda unknown to most of the UN members), the same target date for completion of the Agenda ID02020.

Here, just the key elements as a precursor to what the world is living now, and what is to come, if we don’t stop it – to demonstrate how this entirely criminal sham has been planned. Parts of the scenario are:

A massive vaccination program, probably through compulsory vaccination – Bill Gates’ dream and brainchild is vaccinating 7 billion people.
Massive population reduction, a eugenics plan – in part through vaccination and other means (Ref. Bill Gates, “if we are doing a real good job vaccinating, we may reduce the world population by 10% to 15%”. See “Innovating to Zero!”, speech to the TED2010 annual conference, Long Beach, California, February 18, 2010).
Bill Gates has been advocating for years the need for a massive population reduction – and indeed the more than 20 years of the BMGF’s extensive vaccination programs in Africa, India and other places around the world have seen a record of involuntary sterilization of women between 14 and 49 years. See In 2014 and 2015 Kenya carried out a massive tetanus vaccination program, sponsored by WHO and UNICEF.

An electronic ID for every person on the planet – in the form of a nano chip, possibly injected along with the mandatory vaccination. This nano-chip could be remotely uploaded with all personal data.
Digitized money, no more cash.
Universal rolling out of 5G, later to be followed by 6G.
This is leading to a total control of every individuum on the planet. It is sold to the public as the Internet of Things (TIT), meaning self-driving cars, robotized kitchen equipment, artificial intelligence (AI) for the production and delivery of everything. What the sales pitch doesn’t say, is how humans would be marginalized and enslaved. To carry this masterplan forward, high frequency electromagnet waves are needed. Therefore, rolling out of 5G is a must, no matter what the health impact on humans, fauna and flora may be – and no matter how it may influence viral infections, like possibly the current COVID19.

WHO remains silent, although they do admit that no independent official study has been carried out on the dangers of 5G – and electromagnetic fields in general. Does that mean that WHO is coopted by the Big and Powerful into this deadly spiel? – Let it suffice to say that unlike other UN agencies, WHO was created in 1948 by the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) – see The Lancet. It might be also noteworthy that about half of WHOs budget comes from private interest sources, mostly the pharma industry, but also others, like telecom giants.

This is a precursor for understanding how things are being planned. It may help connecting the dots for what is coming.

It may also help us understand what is happening right now, in the first phase of the Lock Step scenario. It portrays in vivid colors the criminal nature of the Dark Deep State.

Never mind the stock market crash – that’s a speculator’s syndrome, rich people’s risks, as the stock market is a western invention to play with capital and capital gains to the detriment of the workers, whose lives depend on working that capital. They are the first ones to go, when Big Money calls for a merger – or a bankruptcy.



Now the almost universal and justified by NOTHING quarantine, total lockdown of every business, small or big – restaurants, construction, tourism, little and big hardware stores, bakeries, air lines, transport – interrupted supply chains – factories, food processing – and it goes on and on.

In the Global North some up to 90% of business transactions are emanating from small and medium size enterprises (SME). Almost all of them are closed now. Two thirds or more of them may never open again. Employees and workers are laid off, or are reduced to part-time work, meaning part-time pay – but still need to sustain their families. Poverty and desperation set in and becomes rampant. No future in sight. Suicide rates will rise – see Greece in the 2008 / 2009 crisis – and up to ten years later – broken families, foreclosures, families expulsed from rental apartments because they can no longer pay their rents. Street begging becomes normal, except there is nobody left to spare a dime.

In Europe at least a third to maybe 50% or more of the work force – depending on the country and structure of the labor force – is expected to be unemployed or will be reduced to part time work. And that’s only the beginning. In the US official unemployment figures are as of this writing in excess of 23 million – and are expected, by predictions of the FED, Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg -to reach between 32% and 40% in the next quarter. Bankruptcies may spin out of control.

The IMF predicts for 2020 a worldwide economic contraction of a mere 3% – and a small growth rate in the latter part of 2021. How utterly ridiculous! – What planet are these people on? Whom are they trying to fool, and why? Perhaps to encourage countries to borrow huge amounts of foreign exchange from these predatory Bretton Woods institutions, IMF and World Bank – to get deeply into debt, thinking with IMF predictions they will be fine? – Further enslavement by deceit?

This is the Global North – which has some kind of social safety nets, whatever flimsy they may be – there is a sliver of hope for relief. Another sliver of hope is built on the premises that mankind will be constantly creating – working ingeniously inventing -moving forward flowing like a river towards new horizons, creating new dynamics, new jobs… yes, that’s what mankind can do – and in our comfort we have forgotten this virtue – an essential virtue for survival – survival of the corona crisis.

The Global South – or developing countries – presents a grimmer story. Under normal circumstances a third to half of the economy is informal, meaning not tight to any norm of formal or legal organization. They are short-term workers, daily, hourly laborers – living from hand-to-mouth, no savings, no safety nets- and in most cases no health coverage. They are left to the whims of the “market”, literally. Now the market collapsed.

There is nothing left. No work, no income, no money to pay for food, rent, medication – and the government orders them, the deprived poverty-stricken, to stay ‘home’ – ‘lockdown’ in quarantine – to protect themselves from a virus, an imposed virus that nobody sees, but the government and the media make sure you are aware – and SCARED – of its dangers, you never know whether true or false.

Confinement at ”home”? – Where is home? Home is gone. No money to pay rent. Keep social distance – don’t get together. Stay apart. The infection could spread. Fear is of the essence.

Take a city like Lima, Peru. Peru’s total population about 30 million. Lima, about eleven million – of which some 3 to 4 million live on the margins or below – in shantytowns, or worse. Daily, or hourly laborers. They live sometimes hours away from their work place. Now, there is no workplace anymore. They have no money to pay for food, transport or rent – landlords put them in streets, expel them from their properties. How can they stay in confinement? How can they take care of themselves by quarantine – lockdown – having no shelter, no food – desperately looking to earn just enough money to survive another day – and perhaps to share with their families? They can’t.

Lockdown-protection (sic-sic) is only for the rich. The poor they starve with kids and families – and quite possibly with the corona disease. They live within the circles of poverty and misery, where there is nothing to spare. Nobody has anything. Not even in solidarity. There simply is nothing. Total deprivation, caused by a total economic standstill – forced upon the world and especially the poor by evil men – and perhaps also evil women.

These 3 to 4 or 5 million people, they all have come at one point or another from the rural provinces, for which the government does nothing, or not enough to keep them there. So, in search of a better life, they abandon their ‘çhacras’ (little plots of land) and move to the Big City – to paradise – where they are relegated to live in more misery than in their provincial meagre settlements. They endure – always with hope. Now this – the man-made corona crisis – has made life even worse, much worse for them. There are none or far from enough government handouts – or they come too late or get lost in corruption.

In solidarity they assemble. They need to get back to their provincial origins, to their çhacras, to their families – where they will get shelter and food, where they again may feel “home” and loved or at least welcome.

A dictatorial military style government prevents them from leaving – for security reasons, of course – they may infect other people, — the farse continues. And nobody says peep. Nobody dares, for fear of being locked away. Police brutality – sticks, tear gas – repression – back to no shelter – no food. Until the central almighty government decides to “organize” repatriation – by buses, but there is not enough capacity, nor organization – chaos emerges – and the lot gets worse – and how much worse can it get? Famine will strike, will make them weaker and weaker, more prone to diseases and to die – not fromCOVID19, but from famine. But as statistics go, MUST go, by orders of the Masters, such deaths will automatically be attributed to the corona pandemic. Naturally. It’s done elsewhere, in the Global North. Why not in the Global South?

Lima is just a case in point – Its representative probably for most of Latin America, except for Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba – where, in the midst of misery, there is still a sense of solidarity uniting the people – where the government stands with the people, yet, where people are more severely suffering, because of western sanctions – they are literally being murdered by western sanctions – foremost the US of A. A genocidal nation.

The New York Times (22 April 2020) reports, ‘Instead of Coronavirus, the Hunger Will Kill Us.’ A Global Food Crisis Looms. The world has never faced a hunger emergency like this, experts say. It could double the number of people facing acute hunger to 265 million by the end of this year.",1,
99,Mandatory coronavirus vaccination looming on the horizon,Peter Barry Chowka,"The reports during the past two days that President Trump has engaged the military in a project called Operation Warp Speed to fast track a Covid-19 vaccine – which is being compared to the World War Two Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear weapon – feels like the final blow. It has taken the wind out of my sails that America can be made great – aka pre-coronavirus panic – ever again.

President Trump’s promise of a vaccine yesterday implies words like mandate, monitoring, and immunity passports. Contact tracing and tens of thousands of new government workers to spy on and enforce compliance with that unproven strategy which came out of nowhere last month were bad enough. Now we have the next and possibly the final chapter: A new medical mandate enforced by the military that will make Obamacare’s onerous individual health insurance mandate seem like child’s play. There are those of us – millions of us, actually – who have refused to take the annual flu vaccine and any of the other fashionable immunizations that are hyped and sold to us by the medical industrial complex and the mainstream media. When one looks closely, including into the scientific literature itself, there is just too little or no proof at all that most vaccines, including the annual vaunted flu shot, actually do any good – and/or are worth the potential dangers and the costs to personal health that lurk within all of them. The few exceptions for an adult might include something like a tetanus shot after a skin-breaking accident.

An article Thursday by Mike Adams of Natural News – a controversial and highly censored figure according to the MSM – pretty much checked out: “MILITARY vaccine mandates? Dept. of Defense purchasing 500 million ApiJect syringes to inject every person in America with coronavirus vaccine.” I am linking to another site that hosts Adams’ article here. When I attempted to tweet a link to the original on Thursday, Twitter blocked my link.

Adams’s analysis is based on a Department of Defense (DOD) news release on Wednesday: “DOD Awards $138 Million Contract, Enabling Prefilled Syringes for Future COVID-19 Vaccine.” Adams, a prominent proponent of natural alternatives to healing with a popular Web site (currently #4,157 in the U.S. according Alexa, with over 12,000 other sites linking to it), carries the analysis further.

Don’t forget that this is being married with President Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” which aims to bypass all the usual protocols of vaccine safety testing and clinical trials, delivering up to 300 million coronavirus vaccine doses before the end of calendar 2020….

If coronavirus vaccines were planned to be optional — respecting the vaccine choice of individuals — not more than 100 million doses would be needed. The fact that 500 million doses are being manufactured is an admission that the DoD and HHS plan to make coronavirus vaccines mandatory.  [emphasis original.]

With all of the talk about contact tracing and immunity passports, and the hype about a vaccine being our best or our only hope to achieving a viable new normal, Adams’s analysis cannot be dismissed out of hand.

One possible glimmer of hope is that at last – almost two months into the forced shutdown of life as we knew it – substantive critiques of the insane lockdown strategy are beginning to proliferate and to generate a broader discussion about exactly what’s going on here. One noteworthy report and analysis was published two days ago by David Stockman, elected in 1976 to two terms as a Republican Congressman and until 1985 the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan. The title of Stockman’s provocative article is “WAKE-UP, Donald! Your Malpracticing Doctors Are The Real Killers.” Stockman’s article was apparently written on Tuesday May 12: If you don’t think the fix is in, please take note of the big news of the morning. Namely, that the allegedly ultra-busy Dr. Fauci had time last evening to ping Sheryl Gay Stolberg, correspondent for the “failing New York Times”, in order to dump a VLCC size tanker- load of cold water on the urgent need to end Lockdown Nation, now. 

In a Anonymousosecond, of course, Stolberg was on Twitter and on-line with Fauci’s stern admonition to the restless natives of Flyover America to shut-up and stay put. That way the entire MSM had plenty of time to crank-up a feverish barrage of messaging during Fauci’s actual Senate appearance as to how Red State governors are jumping the gun and putting life and limb in danger throughout the country:

“The major message that I wish to convey to the Senate HLP committee tomorrow is the danger of trying to open the country prematurely,” Fauci wrote in the email, which Stolberg posted on Twitter. 

“If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines to: ‘Open America Again,’ then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country. This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal,” wrote Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 

For god’s sake, WAKE UP, Donald!

Rather than quote further from Stockman’s detailed article, replete as it is with charts and graphs and totaling 2,500 words, I simply recommend that people read it for themselves here.

Thank God (capital G), there is an avalanche of writings that are both reflective of data, scientific accuracy, and clear-headed common sense that can serve as an antidote – a vaccine, as it were – to the toxic nonsense being spewed by deep administrative medical hacks and – yes – Democrat party stooges like Dr. Anthony Fauci.  Talk show host Michael Savage is the only prominent national media voice opposing the looming vaccination mandate (podcast here).  Carrying forth that information war, I would argue, represents our last if not our only hope in turning aside this highly destructive Covid-19 panic thing that has captured our culture for the past two months with no end in sight.",1,

141,The Geopolitical Consequences of COVID-19: Over the Cliff,Gordon Duff,"This information is being withheld.

We have promising antivirals, but these have only been used in non-defining test situations that, out of humanitarian concerns, do not have a double-blind.

We are hopeful.

Saying we have reached an ‘end of the world as we know it’ has both good and bad connotations.  Large military forces are no longer in the cards for the major powers.  It has been proven how easy it is to take a ship at sea down.

There are so many ways to target infections to diminish military capability, there is now a weapon that makes any state a major player again, and the US is entirely to blame with their massive biological weapon research program.  You see, the US allowed the program to filter into the universities for ‘cover” as numerous treaties are being violated.  Every president since and including Clinton has a hand in this.

Bush 41 tried to stop this and this and other reasons were why his presidency was ended, a story that will never be told.  Bush learned early about the planning of 9/11 and watched Clinton increasingly lose control of the reins as right wing extremist elements in Washington partnered with rogue elements in the Pentagon, CIA and the criminal elites of the former Soviet Union, soon to make up the core of the Kosher Nostra crime syndicate.

Trump’s handling of this issue, if one is to assume his blunder was unintended, is the single biggest failure of goverAnonymousce in American history.

While covering his tracks, working with organized crime to foster internal rebellion, wrongly targeting China and continually diminishing the presidency, a wave of damage that may eventually be more costly than the pandemic itself has been fomented.

Oil will never be the same.  Fracking will never be profitable, current pipelines and refineries under construction are now useless as are those built in recent years, many at incredible cost to the environment.

Russia’s moves into the Arctic are now likely to be curtailed.

A good example will be Norway.  Their GDP for the next 48 months, even without a permanent market contraction, will be down by 15% with exports down 40% or a bit more.

They will move from a social welfare state with a very high standard of living to a debtor nation in less than 5 years.

This is a best-case scenario for the wealthiest of nations.

Saudi Arabia is entering uncharted waters.  Clearly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE will end their issues with Iran. From Press TV:

“A Saudi whistleblower has said that the number of Saudi royals infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) has “exceedingly surpassed” figures previously revealed by a New York Times report.

The Saudi al-Ahd al-Jadid Twitter account made the revelations on Friday, more than a week after the NYT report said as many as 150 Saudi royals had contracted the virus.

The report at the time said that over 500 beds were being prepared at the elite King Faisal Specialist Hospital that treats members of the Saudi family.

On Friday, however, al-Ahd al-Jadid, which is known for whistleblowing on high-profile cases within the Saudi court, revealed that the Saudi hospital reserved for the royals in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah had been overwhelmed with coronavirus cases.

“The Jeddah specialist hospital, which is reserved for Saudi royals, is no longer capable of accepting new cases,” the Twitter account said.

“Therefore, two hotels have been reserved to be fully used for accommodating and curing infected royals,” it added, naming one of the hotels as being the “Movenpick Hotel”.

As of 1400 GMT on Friday, more than 7,142 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported in the kingdom, with 87 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.

Another Saudi whistleblower, Mujtahid, however, has cast doubt on official figures, arguing that the situation throughout the kingdom is much more critical.

The reports of the COVID-19 disease spreading among royals come as the Saudi family is embroiled in a bitter power struggle between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his potential rivals, according to reports.”

Nations like Iraq have been, thus far, exceptionally effective in limiting the spread of the pandemic. Their last case was on April 16, 2020 and thus far register only 82 deaths with over 500 active patients.

Turkey is reporting a possible downturn, as of April 14, with new cases peaking a few days earlier at around 4500 new cases a day. Turkey, however, has nearly 80,000 active patients and has been accused of significant underreporting.

Russia’s COVID 19 surge began in April but cases are a small fraction of what the US is seeing with a mortality rate, based on official reports, half of that in the US.

Conclusion

COVID 19, a disease that many experts weren’t expecting for a hundred thousand years, is a highly modified version of the Wuhan Horseshoe Bat Virus. It is not plausible that COVID 19 developed without a gene-splicing laboratory. The odds against such a disease developing naturally are astronomical yet we are continually informed of the opposite.

In order to prepare this, front line medical personnel were interviewed, even interrogated to an extent, within parameters of required tenets of patient privacy laws. The truth, the horror of the truth, is worse than the dramatic twitter video. We are asking too much of far too few and this should never be allowed to happen again.

We have turned medical personnel/first responders into “cannon fodder.”",1,
49,Why Is the US Apparently Not Testing for the COVID-19 Coronavirus?,Larry Romanoff,"All reports are that the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is not testing for the new coronavirus COVID-19, and that reliable tests in any case do not exist in the US. This is an area bereft of rational explanation. The US may have many thousands of coronavirus infections, but no one knows because the CDC are not testing for them. The CDC produced a series of test kits that produced wildly random results, positive or negative, followed by instructions to discard the test kits as unreliable. (1) Several U.S. states said the new coronavirus test kits did not work, while others said they were totally unreliable. (2) New York City reported the government-issued tests are faulty and “cannot be relied upon to provide an accurate result”. Those faulty kits were also shipped all over the world, but to my knowledge the CDC have relayed that information to no one outside the US.

Further, American hospitals have been discharging infected patients on the basis of these faulty tests, the CDC explaining that there have been many situations where test results alternate between negative and positive on the same patients. (3)

One US media source said California had only 200 proper testing kits in the entire state, and very few anywhere in the country, but I could find no evidence the CDC is preparing new test kits, apparently doing nothing. It seems the reason the CDC can claim no COVID-19 infections is because they are not testing, and are unable in any case to perform reliable tests. It might be amusing to mock the US for being unable to produce a reliable test, but the Americans are not incompetent, which unfortunately raises many questions.

It seems bizarre that while the CDC could quickly develop and apply reliable tests nationwide, they apparently prefer to not do that, at a time when California and other states have already declared an emergency, and the White House canceled flights to China and requested $2 billion in virus funding.

According to media reports, the US has done only around 450 tests while even much smaller nations have tested many tens of thousands. (4) Even more surprising is that the CDC is apparently refusing to test for COVID-19 infections. The first such US infection from unknown sources wasn’t tested until after the patient had been on a ventilator in the ICU for nearly one week. The hospital claimed they “were unable to get her tested for five days, claiming the CDC refused to test victims who had not traveled to outbreak-hit regions”. It appears The CDC simply refused to administer a test even though the patient was in critical condition. (5)

In the meantime, a Chinese firm has put into mass production a highly-accurate test for COVID-19 that has received the highest level of European certification and that is now being marketed worldwide. China’s genomics sequencing company BGI has received international recognition and vast orders for its detection kits for the novel coronavirus. It has already shipped many hundreds of thousands to more than 25 countries and is in the order process with another 25 nations. For one, if the CDC wanted reliable tests, they could simply order from China. (6)

The CDC estimates that this flu season has seen at least 29 million illnesses, 280,000 hospitalisations and 16,000 deaths (16), but Japan and Taiwan both stated that American coronavirus deaths (potentially in the thousands) are being buried in untested infections, and in fatalities blamed on the seasonal flu. If those deaths were tested, the results are not being made public. Chinese news website Huanqiu (9) related one case in the US where a woman’s relative was told by physicians he died of the flu, but where the death certificate listed the coronavirus as the cause of death. On February 26, ABC News affiliate KJCT8 News Network reported that a woman recently told the media that her sister died on from coronavirus infection. Montrose, Colorado resident Almeta Stone said, “They (the medical staff) kept us informed that it was the flu, and when I got the death certificate, there was a coronavirus in the cause of death.” (10)

We cannot ascertain the number of such cases in the US but since the CDC apparently has no reliable test kits and is conducting little or no testing for the virus, there may be others. As I stated in an earlier article (11), virologists from Japan and Taiwan both came to the conclusion that this might indicate the coronavirus had already spread in the US but where the symptoms were being officially attributed to other diseases, and thus possibly masked. The following was reported in detail in prominent Chinese media, who don’t normally publish anything speculative. An American, Dr. Paul Cottrell says he was sent a copy of a message between an employee of the US CDC and a listener to his channel. According to the CDC official webpage, the number of total confirmed coronavirus cases in the US was 35 at the time (February 21, 2020), but the message copied to Cottrell read “There have already been over 1,000 cases in the US, although on the news, they are just keeping things quiet for now and reporting far less to the public.” In the message, the alleged CDC source stated the “CDC suspects cases in over 32 states at this point”. Cottrell says he has been unable so far to obtain confirmation from the CDC of the message or its contents, but no denials either. Cottrell is a Ph.D, has completed pre-med studies and is currently enrolled in a Biology Master’s program at Harvard. Further, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is now seeking federal protection from attempts to silence him after alleging that the US government was not taking adequate precautions against the COVID-19 outbreak. The complaint alleged that federal health employees were “improperly deployed” to assist the quarantined Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, and were “not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation”, according to a Washington Post report and portions of the complaint filing obtained by other media. (13)

There is another very curious part of this apparent puzzle. In August of 2019, the CDC completely shut down the US Military bio-weapons lab at Fort Detrick (USAMRIID) for “bio-safety hazards”. They issued a cease-and-desist order and all research was ordered to be immediately suspended until further notice but, interestingly, the US media took almost no note of this event. One would imagine that in light of such a drastic measure, rampant testing would be obligatory, but in this case apparently not. Yet Taiwan media reported COVID-19 infections of Taiwanese residents originating from the US (Hawaii) in September of 2019. The World Military Games were held in Wuhan during the last two weeks of October. (14) (15) (16)

It may be worth mentioning that this wasn’t the first time such concerns have arisen. Between 2005 and 2012, the latest date for which I have accurate figures, the US CDC received 1,059 “release reports” – an average of an incident every few days involving “theft, loss, release causing an occupational exposure, or release outside of primary biocontainment barriers” of dangerous pathogens. The NYT and Western media pilloried China for several small leaks of a virus ten years ago, but the Americans have had 1,057 more serious releases than did China during the same period, many of these involving deadly pathogens.

287,"OneLegacy Issues Guidelines for Organ, Eye and Tissue Donation in Response to Coronavirus Outbreak",,"As the nation and the world adjusts to the realities brought about by the coronavirus, OneLegacy continues its work as an essential healthcare provider by collaborating with local hospitals, transplant centers and families to enable lifesaving transplantation. OneLegacy is the largest independent organ, eye and tissue recovery organization in the world. Since its first reported occurrence on Jan. 21, 2020, there have tragically been an estimated 110 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S., said OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone. Over this same period of time, 1,188 people have died while waiting for an organ transplant, while more than 5,000 lives have been saved through transplantation. For this reason, OneLegacy clinical professionals are continuing to respond to, assess, support families, manage donors and recover organs for transplant from our hospitals amidst the COVID-19 challenge. Supporting this lifesaving and essential purpose, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) yesterday issued a guideline that identifies transplantation as a Tier 3, High Acuity Surgery, Do Not Postpone procedure. Continuing this lifesaving work has required modifications to practices to prevent contagion and to ensure the health and safety of recipients, family members and healthcare staff. Mone says that these changes will continue to evolve but currently include: The international efforts to contain the virus have required significant changes in the lives and practices of millions of people, schools and businesses, said Mone. We are working with our partner hospitals and transplant centers and their infection control practices to assure the safety of eligible individuals who want to be donors and the many recipients waiting to receive their gift of life. Mone says that appropriate precautions have been implemented at OneLegacy itself, including social distancing, increased opportunities and prompts for hand-washing, reduction of meeting sizes to 10 or fewer, video conferencing in lieu of in-person meetings whenever possible, and Personal Protective Equipment for those in direct contact with possibly infected donors. All of this Mone says is designed to ensure the health and well-being of our employees, donor families and ultimately transplant recipients. By following these precautions, we are able to continue our lifesaving mission and our ongoing stewardship of the gift of donation; and we continue to be committed to providing service to our communities. Last year OneLegacy enabled the transplant of 1,619 organs from 557 donors, an increase of 8% over 2018. In addition, the organization reported a 4% increase in tissue donors to 3,005, helping over 225,000 individuals, while sight-saving corneas transplanted increased a remarkable 25% from the prior year to 1,616. These increases were part of a nationwide increase in organ donors that projects to be as much as a 10% increase over 2018s all-time high. These increases demonstrate the incredible generosity of our community toward one another, says Mone. We believe that same generosity and caring will help us all successfully confront the challenges posed by COVID-19. Mone says that despite the record number of people who say yes to donation, the need for transplants is growing far faster than potential donors. That drives us to help every Southern Californian to choose to register to be an organ donor at the DMV and at donatelifecalifornia.org and to explore the option to be a living donor for a friend or family member, he says. OneLegacy is a nonprofit organization dedicated to saving and healing lives through organ, eye and tissue donation in seven counties in Southern California: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Kern. Serving more than 200 hospitals, 11 transplant centers and a diverse population of over 20 million, OneLegacy is the largest organ, eye and tissue recovery organization in the world, For more information, visit onelegacy.org, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter.

472,Is this Republican the most hated man in Washington? - CNNPolitics,"Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large","(CNN) Days after Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky forced members of Congress to trek back to Washington amid the coronavirus pandemic to cast an in-person vote on the $2 trillion economic stimulus package, Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney did the worst thing you can do to an incumbent members of Congress: She donated to Massie's Republican primary opponent. Cheney's leadership political action committee -- Cowboy PAC -- donated $2,500, the maximum allowable under federal guidelines, to a lawyer named Todd McMurtry, according to Bloomberg News' Greg Giroux (The Kentucky primary is set for June 23 ). THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Bold! Especially when you consider that Cheney isn't just any Republican House member -- she's a member of party leadership as the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. It's hard to imagine then that the other GOP House leaders were unaware of -- or disagreed with -- Cheney making clear exactly how unhappy she is with Massie. Massie, not one for backing down, took a shot at Cheney -- and Ohio Republican Rep. Mike Turner, who also contributed to McMurtry, via Twitter : ""I guess #neocons really do hate coming to work, while expecting nurses and truckers and soldiers to keep doing their jobs,"" he tweeted. ""Who knew? @RepLizCheney @RepMikeTurner"" Read More To which Turner shot back: ""Buddy, I was coming for the vote before you had anything to do with it. I contributed to your opponent because I believe that you don't belong in Congress. BTW, I'm certain @RepLizCheney was already going to be there too."" Reminder: These are all Republicans! As is President Donald Trump, who, back in late March, tweeted this about Massie: ""Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from, unfortunately, a truly GREAT State, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress. He just wants the publicity. He can't stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous & costly. Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn't their fault. It is 'HELL' dealing with the Dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the 'big picture' done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party!"" (McMurtry is now using Trump's Twitter attack on Massie in a TV ad .) At the moment, Massie is still in the Republican Party. And, as his tweet to Cheney and Turner on Thursday makes clear, he isn't backing down. At all. As congressional Democrats negotiate with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin about adding more money to the Paycheck Protection Program -- and other coronavirus-related entities -- Massie is already promising to, again, object to a voice-vote approval, meaning that members would have to travel back to the nation's capital to cast a recorded vote. Here's what Massie told conservative radio host Todd Starnes on Monday : ""By calling them out on the Constitution and making them come to Washington, DC, in order to pass a bill, they're finding it harder to pass this next bill because they know they're all going to have to come to work. They know I will get in my car and drive there and make them vote on it. ""And my colleagues, a lot of them, frankly, are cowards. They are telling supermarket workers to go to work, they are telling the truckers to keep driving, yet they don't want to show up for work. So by forcing them to come to work on the third bill, I've forestalled at least for a moment the ridiculousness of the fourth bill that Nancy Pelosi has been talking about."" ""Cowards""! Whoa boy. The question now isn't whether most of Massie's colleagues -- Republican and Democrat -- in Washington can't stand him. They can't. The question is whether Massie's status as the most hated man in Washington helps or hurts him as he tries to beat back McMurtry's primary challenge. There's already a level of uncertainty built in to the primary because it has been moved from May to June due to the coronavirus pandemic . So it's not clear how voters will react to the change, and whether or not ongoing concerns about the spread of coronavirus will impact turnout. Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that there has been no public polling released in the race -- before or after Massie's decision to force lawmakers back to Washington last month. One thing that the controversy has been good for is Massie's fundraising. He raised over $800,000 (and has almost $700,000 left to spend) in the first three months of the year (He raised less than $400,000 in 2017 and 2018 combined ). McMurtry brought in more than $320,000 over the first three months of 2020 , a total that included a $135,000 personal loan. There's still more than two months left before Kentucky voters choose between Massie and McMurtry, of course. And if Cheney's move this week is an indication, Massie's unpopularity in Washington may have real-world consequences for him back in the Bluegrass State.",0,
503,"David Bowie bassist Matthew Seligman, 64, dies of coronavirus | Music | The Guardian",https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh,"A former bass guitarist who appeared on stage with David Bowie at the Live Aid concert has died after spending two weeks on a ventilator at St Georgeâ€™s hospital in Tooting, south London. Friends said Matthew Seligman, 64, who later became a lawyer, may have caught coronavirus on a visit to his brother Simon, who was himself in and out of hospital over the preceding six months and had recently died from causes unrelated to coronavirus. Rod Campbell-Taylor, a legal colleague, remembered Seligman, who died on 17 April, as â€œunfailingly generous and inspiringâ€ and a man who â€œwas very far from anyoneâ€™s idea of a rock star lawyerâ€, despite his successful first career in the 1980s. Seligman played in post-punk psychedelic band the Soft Boys, fronted by Robyn Hitchcock, after graduating from Cambridge University, and enjoyed short stints in the Thompson Twins and in Thomas Dolbyâ€™s band. â€œMatthew would want us to remember the good times and have a party,â€ Dolby said, promising to hold a candle-lit vigil on YouTube in commemoration. The new-wave bassist went on to become a successful session musician who played with Bowie on the Absolute Beginners single and at the Live Aid concert in 1985 â€“ as well as with solo artists such as SinÃ©ad Oâ€™Connor and Morrissey. He retrained in law at the beginning of the following decade, initially working on personal injury and litigation cases, including the Marchioness disaster, before switching to human rights. His legal work remained a major focus until his death. â€œEven after being admitted to hospital, Matthew continued to send WhatsApp messages about his own and other peopleâ€™s cases, as well as offerings of support to a staff member whose mother was also in hospital, right up to being intubated. â€œMatthewâ€™s last message to colleagues was about a case he had been working up for the previous six months on behalf of a severely disabled client, who like all his clients was bereft to learn he was in intensive care,â€ Campbell-Taylor said. Despite performing to stadium crowds in his younger days, he was low-key about his musical past when a lawyer. â€œAlthough he had stories about David and Mick and others, Matthew was very far from anyoneâ€™s idea of a rock star lawyer; boyishly enthusiastic, humble, capable of showing vulnerability as he was incapable of telling a lie and utterly intolerant of any form of bullying or cruelty,â€ his colleague recalled. Seligman leaves behind a son, Deji, a daughter, Lily and his partner, Mami Kanai.",0,
304,Boris Johnson hits back: EU told there'll be NO extension as Britain gets tough on Brexit | Politics | News | Express.co.uk,"Sam Lister, Daily Express Deputy Political Editor","   It said the country also needs the ""legislative and economic flexibility"" of being fully outside the bloc to help the economy recover from the impact of the pandemic. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for the transition period to be extended to allow for the ""unprecedented uncertainty"" caused by the impact of coronavirus.    But the Prime Ministerâ€™s spokesman insisted there will be no delay.  He said: â€œWe will not ask to extend the transition. And, if the EU asks, we will say no.  â€œExtending the transition would simply prolong the negotiations, prolong business uncertainty, and delay the moment of control of our borders.  â€œIt would also keep us bound by EU legislation at a point when we need legislative and economic flexibility to manage the UK response to the coronavirus pandemic.â€     The next full round of negotiations on future relations between the UK and EU will begin next Wednesday and last for a week.  Progress in the talks will be reviewed in June to see if it is likely a new deal can be reached or whether the UK will leave on world trading rules.  Miss Georgieva, IMF managing director, said that the pandemic was causing global turmoil, adding â€œlet's not make it any tougher"".   She told the BBC: ""My advice would be to seek ways in which this element of uncertainty is reduced in the interests of everybody, the UK, the EU, and the whole world.""

197,CHINA QUARANTINES 11 MILLION PEOPLE OVER ‘MYSTERIOUS VIRUS’,The Healing Oracle Team,"With talk of mass quarantines and inflated numbers of sufferers and deaths from a new strain of Coronavirus “2019-nCoV,” emanating from China and Asia, we wonder what is really behind all this News hype.

Is this perhaps the start of a new vaccine program?

In todays world of social media, fake news, conspiracy theories, nationalism and border paranoia, it seems that there is much to gain from over inflating stories of sickness across the political divide. With talk of screenings at airports and of cover ups, this all feeds the media and builds on fear.

It’s the perfect storm for drug makers. Could Big Pharma, Merck, GSK, the CDC and their mass media partnerships be behind this news? There is much money to be made in fighting diseases and apparently stopping diseases before they have even begun with mass vaccination programs. It’s what the vaccine industry is built on. Create fear in order to create a necessity. Then give everyone a disease in order to prevent it.

According to Prep for That, this is actually a mass cover-up and that 11 Million People have been quarantined over this ‘Mysterious Virus’ in Wuhan, China.

“The Wuhan Coronavirus is now appearing to be a massive outbreak beyond the first official reports. Chinese officials have reportedly quarantined at least 11 million people in Wuhan,” which is more or less the entire population of Wuhan.

For what and why we ask and is this even really happening?

“No traffic is being allowed to exit, or enter the city as of this hour. All plane and train travel is shut down. This is an unprecedented move that’s sure to send waves of shock and fear up the spines of people all over the world. Chinese state media made the announcement via Twitter” they say.

What they’re doing is a very, very strong measure and with full commitment,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization said in a WHO press conference on Wednesday afternoon.

The most common symptoms of the new coronavirus are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Lab tests ruled out MERS and SARS, as well as several other possible illnesses.

Spreading fear: Video of roads blocked in and out of the city of Wuhan appear apocalyptic at this hour. Additionally, video of quarantine tents are now surfacing.

But we wonder, could this actually be a mass vaccination regime across a concentrated area? Could this lead to further outbreaks as shedding from any potential vaccinations can lead to the disease spreading further? As we have seen with the MMR vaccine.

While Wuhan’s officials have reported only 444 infected persons, it now appears that such numbers are largely deflated according to Prep for That. It’s unclear whether or not Chinese officials are participating in an active cover up, or if the outbreak has indeed swelled beyond control.

Coming to America

But rest assured bug business in the USA is onto it!

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) is requesting that President Trump ban travel from China, a move that if ordered, would certainly have extreme political ramifications.

“I write to you today about the continued spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, which has now arrived on American soil,” Cotton wrote in the Wednesday letter, which came after the first U.S. case of coronavirus was confirmed in Washington state earlier this week.

“Once again, a deadly virus is emanating from the People’s Republic of China. The Wuhan coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China, killing at least seventeen individuals so far. The disease has now spread to Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea. At least one case has been confirmed in the United States. I’m confident that the United States Government is undertaking all possible measures to contain the spread of the disease, but I’m deeply concerned that waging an efficient and successful campaign against this virus depends on the trustworthiness and transparency of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), an organization with a horrendous history in these matters.”

Like the US Govt is so squeaky clean?

There’s certainly nothing like a major international medical scandal with mass media coverage mixed with some good old political intrigue, xenophobia and fear mongering, to set the tone for a new Vaccine program.

Or is this a genuine news story and the people of China have a bigger epidemic on their hands? Our guess is that you will never know, but expect to be forced to have the vaccine pretty soon.

Either way according to USA Today and Yahoo News drug makers are hustling to make a vaccine to counter the rapidly-spreading respiratory virus that has sickened at least 830 in China and two people in the United States.  

The National Institutes of Health has partnered with a Boston-area company, Moderna, on a vaccine targeting the novel coronavirus. A Pennsylvania biotechnology company, Inovio, also secured a $9 million grant from Norway-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop a vaccine. The company already is developing a vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, another type of coronavirus.

Officials with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases say they can quickly develop a vaccine because Chinese scientists rapidly sequenced the virus’s genome. So thank the heavens for Medical Science.

“The agency has the funding and technology,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “Barring any bureaucratic or regulatory holdups, which I don’t think will happen (of course), we can almost certainly get into phase one in three months.”

‘Everything now is experimental.’ Here’s how doctors are treating coronavirus

Of course USA Today where quick to use the conspiracy theory card and dismiss any theory of wrong doing, saying:

Bogus coronavirus conspiracy theory about patents, vaccine spreads on social media Following the outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus in Wuhan, China in December and the announcement of the first American case Jan. 21, several groups and individuals are circulating false rumors on Facebook about the mystery pathogen.

Numerous posts claim the virus has been patented — and some even suggest, incorrectly, that the virus was made in a lab and a vaccine already exists.

Yet we have also seen that grants have been rushed through and red tape cut with the race now on to create the vaccine. So either way Big Pharma is set to win big on this one.

But either way, Big Pharma and big business is set to gain. As all of this of course has an affect on the stock market with companies making money from the News and again according to USA Today:

The spread of China’s coronavirus is providing stock-market investors with another reason for near-term caution as major U.S. equity benchmarks trade near all-time highs, analysts said, offering a potential trigger for a near-term pullback.

So be sure to know that medical health is big business and while big business is involved, you can be sure there are many other masked agendas aside from any human death toll.",1,
490,Hill International Reports 2019 Fourth Quarter and Year End Financial Results,,"PHILADELPHIA, March 16, 2020 â€” Hill International, Inc. (NYSE:HIL) (â€œHillâ€ or the â€œCompanyâ€), the global leader in managing construction risk, announced today its results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. This release will be followed by a conference call on March 17, 2020 at 9:00 am EDT with Hill Chief Executive Officer Raouf Ghali and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Todd Weintraub. Mr. Ghali commented, â€œThe Company successfully returned to profitability, reduced its cost base and significantly increased its backlog during 2019. I expect continued positive results in 2020 as we convert the increased backlog into revenue and continue to manage our costs. I look forward to providing further details of our performance during our call.â€ Fourth Quarter Financial Results Hillâ€™s consulting fee revenue (â€œCFRâ€) was $76.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, compared to $75.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Total revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 was $83.8 million, compared to $100.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Net income attributable to Hill was $12.1 million, resulting in a margin of 15.8% as a percentage of CFR, for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Hill of $7.3 million, resulting in a margin of (9.7)% as a percentage of CFR, for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The Companyâ€™s operating income for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 was $10.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $4.5 million during the same period in the prior year. Mr. Weintraub added, â€œThe Company continued its improved 2019 performance with a strong fourth quarter, supported by solid underlying results of operations bolstered by collection of a significant aged receivable from a Libya contract.â€ Selling, general, and administrative (â€œSG&Aâ€) expenses were $23.1 million and $37.3 million in the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. SG&A was favorably impacted in 2019 by a net credit of $7.1 million related to collection of a fully reserved receivable from a Libya project. The fourth quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted by a bad debt provision of $3.1 million and costs related to the Companyâ€™s Profit Improvement Plan (â€œPIPâ€) of $2.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), which excludes certain effects of the SG&A items specified above, improved to $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $(0.5) million for the fourth quarter of 2018 (see EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA table below). Hillâ€™s adjusted EBITDA margin, as a percentage of CFR, was 5.2% and (0.6)% for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Year End Financial Results CFR was $308.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $337.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $376.4 million, compared to $428.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net income attributable to Hill for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $14.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, resulting in a margin of 4.6% of CFR, compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Hill of $30.6 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, resulting in a margin of (9.1)% of CFR for the year ended December 31, 2018. Hillâ€™s operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $18.3 million, compared to an operating loss of $21.0 million during the same period in the prior year. SG&A expenses were $111.1 million and $154.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. SG&A was favorably impacted in 2019 by a net credit of $7.1 million related to collection of a fully reserved receivable from a project in Libya. The year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by costs related to the Companyâ€™s PIP of $19.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the effects of the SG&A items specified above and other one-time costs, was $16.9 million for both years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (see EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA table below). The Companyâ€™s adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% and 5.0% over CFR for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) continuing operations was $10.0 million and $(25.0) million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Free cash flow (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $6.1 million, which represents net cash provided by continuing operations, less $3.9 million in purchases of property and equipment during the year. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $(27.4) million, which represents net cash used in continuing operations, less $2.3 million in purchases of property and equipment during the year. Backlog Backlog represents the Companyâ€™s estimate of the amount of uncompleted projects under contract and awards in-hand that are expected to be recognized as CFR in future periods as a component of total revenue. Hillâ€™s backlog is based upon the binding nature of the underlying contract, commitment or letter of intent, and other factors, including the economic, financial and regulatory viability of the project and the likelihood of the contract being extended, renewed or canceled. Although backlog reflects business that the Company considers to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. It is an important indicator of future performance and is used by the Company in planning Hillâ€™s operational needs. Backlog is not a measure defined in GAAP and the Companyâ€™s methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog. Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (â€œEBITDAâ€) and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (â€œGAAPâ€). EBITDA, in addition to operating profit, net income, and other GAAP measures, is a useful indicator of Hillâ€™s financial and operating performance and its ability to generate cash flow from operations that are available for taxes and capital expenditures. The Company believes that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of Hillâ€™s financial statements in evaluating its operating performance because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a companyâ€™s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA, adjusted to exclude the impact of certain items, including non-recurring, one-time costs (as presented in the table below), unrealized foreign currency translation losses (benefit) and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of the Companyâ€™s CFR. The Company believes that the adjusted EBITDA margin is useful to investors and other external users of Hillâ€™s financial statements and that it is an indicator of the Companyâ€™s efficiency and ability to convert CFR into cash flows from operations. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should recognize that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The following table includes a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in addition to adjusted EBITDA margin: (1) The three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes amount collected, net of amounts paid to subcontractors and other fees. (2) Share-based compensation excludes expense related to shares issued as part of the PIP during the year ended December 31, 2019 and were accrued by the Company in prior years. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash provided by (used in) continuing operations, less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow is a useful indicator that provides additional perspective on Hillâ€™s ability to generate cash that is available to the Company for taxes and other corporate purposes. Investors should recognize that free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. This measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

532,"Tom Friedman: Trump should ask Bezos, Gates to help on coronavirus",Kevin Stankiewicz@kevin_stank,"President Donald Trump should have asked Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates to assist the U.S. government with its response to the coronavirus, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman told CNBC on Thursday. Friedman, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, said the U.S. has a logistics problem and a ""cure problem"" for the disease, and the founders of Amazon and Microsoft have the expertise to help. ""If I had a chance to write the president's speech, I would have begun by saying, I'm actually asking Jeff Bezos of Amazon to take a leave from Amazon and take over the effort to get test kits manufactured and distributed everywhere in America,"" Friedman said on ""Squawk Box. Friedman said he would have tapped Gates, whose charitable foundation focuses on improving global health care and reducing poverty, to ""oversee all efforts to come up with a rapid cure for this virus."" In a address Wednesday, Trump announced he was suspending travel from most of Europe for 30 days in an attempt to slow the coronavirus pandemic. Trump also said he will be asking Congress to provide payroll tax relief for Americans and instructing the Small Business Administration to ""provide capital and liquidity"" for small businesses. Friedman said he watched the speech hoping to gain confidence in the government's response to the global pandemic. ""I was not reassured, and the market clearly was not reassured,"" Friedman said. U.S. stocks sank Thursday morning as investors remained concerned about an economic slowdown due to the coronavirus.",0,
95,BILL GATES: THE CATHOLIC RELIGION MAY HAVE TO BE SUSPENDED FOR EVER,Rome Editor,"Ominously, at 17:40 in this Video, Bill Gates implies that the Catholic Religion will remain outlawed until all can be certified to have received a vaccine, if even then!

He is talking about suspending the Mass for 18 months or forever!

And not only mass, all professional sporting events, like Football, Baseball, Soccer, Basketball, Hockey etc. etc..

I know there has always been speculation about Bill Gates’ name having the ASCII value of 666, but his comments above are more ridiculous, they are diabolic!

Melinda Gates is a Roman Catholic, and Bill and Melinda have raised all their children as Catholics. However, I some how think there is something big missing in their lives, if they think like this: God.

179,CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN EUROPE: CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE OR PREPLANNED ACTION,Anonymous,"There is little doubt that the coronavirus threat is overestimated by mainstream media and governemnts. Covid-19 is in fact an ordinary viral disease with a slightly higher mortality from complications for people of old age or peopel with weakened immunity. Another open secret is that the current hysteria over the outbreak is being successfully used by some players to achieve their own economic and geopolitical goals. Looking at the current situation in Europe, one could suppose that some forces have seized an opportunity and are now fueling the coronavirus crisis intentionally.",1,
60,"China’s Covid-19 Reporting Is Truthful, Birx and Trump Demonstrate-Unwittingly",John V. Walsh,"At President Trump’s April 18 press briefing on the Covid-19 Pandemic, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the US response to the outbreak, criticized China’s reports on the Covid-19 data.  

She did so by showing a chart with data from the following countries.  (I have updated the chart with data[1] from the New York Times of April 19, but the two data sets differ by only a small and negligible amount.). Dr. Birx called China’s low number “unrealistic,” saying, “I put China on there so you could see how basically unrealistic this could be.”  That was after President Trump pointed at China’s number and interrupted Birx to ask rhetorically, “Excuse me. Does anybody really believe this number? Does anybody really believe this number?”  (Transcript here; see minute 37:08 and following.)

The argument that Blix and Trump were making was clear.  China’s number was way out of line with the others, lower by more than a factor of 10.  Therefore, China’s report was a lie.

But in her chart Dr. Birx omitted data coming from countries of East Asia and nearby which have been praised by the US media for their performance and whose data are unquestioned in the West.  Here are some relevant omitted data, taken again from the New York Times of April 19, with China included again for comparison. China’s number falls right into line with that of neighboring countries!  Birx’s exercise in fact is a classic example of lying by omission, a half truth being a full lie. Either Dr. Birx was aware of this data and dishonestly withheld it, or she was not aware of it and she is incompetent.  Neither conclusion is very comforting.  Trump is to be criticized both for his jumping in to bash China and for tolerating someone like Birx with the direction of the government’s response to the pandemic.

These data make it quite clear that countries of East Asia and Australia have performed better than the US and Europe.  Why is this?  Two categories of explanation suggest themselves.  First different strains of the virus may differ in lethality. There is no proof for this, but there is some suggestion of it in laboratory tests.

A second reason for the better performance of East Asian countries and Australia is that they paid attention to what China was doing, perhaps because they are neighbors and better informed of what was going on in China.  Much news about China is simply not reported by the mainstream media in the US and among US “allies.”  In this case, however, concern about a developing pandemic right next door may have lofted news from China over information blockade.  These countries may have seen that China had accumulated considerable experience with the virus and at great cost in life and suffering was having success in stopping its spread.  As a result, they followed what China did in many respects.

But no matter the reason, China’s data fall right in line with many of its neighbors. That is the main point. The bottom line is that these data provide us with no reason to doubt China’s reporting. And the correspondence between the data China released and other regional data is consistent with the fact that China reported Covid-19 deaths accurately.

Since so much attention is devoted to fact checking Trump’s press conferences, I thought surely the press would have picked up on this obvious manipulation of data.  I checked on the fact check of the press conference by CNN, no friend of the Trump administration, and there was no mention of this lie by omission.  Next, I checked PBS, a pillar of probity and respectability and also no friend of Trump.  PBS does a brief online look at each press conference with anchor Hari Sreenivasan and Zachary Green.  They showed Birx’s chart and noted Trump’s comments but made no criticism of the omitted data.  A check of the NYT, another arch-foe of Trump, on the following day disclosed no mention of the Birx-Trump deceit.

How can this be explained?  One cannot help but feel that the idea of Chinese malfeasance in all things has become so deeply embedded in the body politic that to challenge charges made against China is now beyond the pale.  No charge, no matter how unfounded or contrary to actual fact, is too brazen to report without a moment’s consideration.  In fact, to tell the truth in such a situation may damage the career of a rising journalistic “star.”

Why are we to be concerned about this matter? Because China’s experience has had much to teach us.  And since China is now emerging from the recession caused by the pandemic, it may have more to teach us as we move to economic recovery.  For example, to get back to normalcy, China has now rolled out large scale testing on a territory roughly the size of the US.  How is that working and how might it be improved?  To ignore China’s experience without careful evaluation at a time like this could well end up as a self-destructive act.

But there is an even bigger danger here.  There has been a growing antagonism between China and the US since Obama’s ill-advised “Pivot” against China followed by Trump’s equally ill-advised trade war.  Now we find Trump and Biden competing to be the number one China basher.  The press conference of April 18 falls into this pattern, allowing Trump to parade as tough on China and escape from a thrashing by a China-hostile media for his earlier praise of Xi and China for their response to Covid-19. To take the route of hostility to China can lead to a clash between two economic giants and nuclear powers, which could lead to a disaster for all humanity.  As Henry Kissinger reminded us some time back, armed conflict between the two giants could bring the same level of devastation to all the world that WWI brought to Europe.  And that is likely to be an underestimate. Let us step back from this path before it is too late.",1,
184,Miles Guo: CCP ordered Guo Deyin to create Wuhan coronavirus,GM35,"According to Miles Guo’s live steam broadcast with Steven Bannon on Monday, Feb 3, 2020, Guo Deyin, a prominent Chinese scientist, is responsible for creating Wuhan coronavirus under the order of the Chinese Communist Party.

The project is so secret that some of the Chinese kleptocrats do not even know about it. Now in China, the anti-American sentiment is far worse than the anti-virus sentiment, because the CCP is blaming the U.S. for creating the virus.

316,"See the glint in her eyes â€“Von der Leyen is planning a power-grab, says ALEXANDRA PHILLIPS | Express Comment | Comment | Express.co.uk","Alexandra Phillips, Former Brexit Party MEP","  Nothing gets federalist hearts racing in Brussels like a good crisis, but having spent the first month of the Covid-19 outbreak flailing around as European countries closed internal borders and battened down the hatches, Ursula Von Der Leyen now has the audacity to claim credit for European nations helping one another out while simultaneously offering a strange apology to Italy for having done nothing. Knowing full well that sentiment in Italy towards the EU is at an all time low, as Italians burn EU flags and polling reveals Italexit could well win a referendum on membership, the Commission President said the continent owed the country a heartfelt apology for not being there when Italy needed a helping hand at the beginning. Perversely she went on to say that after a slow start, Europe had become the â€˜beating heart of solidarityâ€™ citing medical equipment, doctors and patients exchanged between countries, something that has been entirely undertaken at national, not EU level. She even strangely drew up a list of conditions for countries exiting lockdown, before admitting it was none of her business. Yet the real test of European solidarity is yet to come. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is well aware of the major economic shockwaves that will tear through the Mediterranean nation. The EUâ€™s proposal of help is unlikely to be much of an elixir. In a hint at the usual Brussels power-grab that takes place whenever disaster strikes, Von Der Leyen used her speech to the European Parliament to talk about the creation of a new â€˜Marshall Planâ€™ echoing the American strategy of giving aid to Europe after the Second World War to jump start trade, but also to deliberately to see off political opponents. Look closely at EU proposals and itâ€™s clear any money will likely come not just with integrationist ambition, but frightening conditions. The Commission chief said at least one trillion euros would be needed to meet the needs of Europeâ€™s worst hit countries. But with Italy a net contributor to the EU budget and a gaping hole left by the UK after Brexit, where this money will come from is yet to be seen.  Germany and the Netherlands shot down the idea of â€˜Coronabondsâ€™ which would see debt mutualised across the Eurozone. With Italian debt already at 136.2% of its GDP, it is obvious the country cannot borrow its way out of severe pain with a similar huge cash injection to that promised to Brits by the UK Chancellor. Salivating Europhiles in Brussels have reached into their briefcases and pulled out their favourite fix-all: the dreaded European Stability Mechanism. On the surface, this bail-out scheme allows debt-riddled countries to borrow from the EU to stabilise their economies. But take a closer look, particularly at Article 12, and it is revealed that this act of generosity is on the condition of handing over near complete control of economic and social policy. Just ask Greece. After being forced to accept bail-outs following the Eurozone crisis, the democratically elected government was removed and replaced with the Eurocrat Troika who took over the running of the country and imposed ferocious austerity to meet the loansâ€™ eye-watering terms. Within ten years, the Greek economy shrank by a quarter, pension payouts were slashed by up to 40% and 90% of families in the poorest neighbourhoods had to rely on food banks. Even today, one third of working people still live in poverty, surviving on just â‚¬350 a month. The tragic human consequence was a spike in suicides of 45%. Despite vast sums of so-called aid being poured into Greece, this money became new debt used to pay off old borrowings, simply to save the Euro. Add that to the fact that that right in the middle of Italyâ€™s Coronavirus crisis, the EU took the extraordinary step of fining Italy a whopping â‚¬7.5million for illegal government support to the hotel industry in Sardinia, with an added â‚¬80,000 a day fine for non-compliance, and Von Der Leyenâ€™s words of heartfelt apology donâ€™t ring true. While countries can borrow 2% of their GDP under the ESM to fund healthcare with no strings attached, another series of loans targeted at economic recovery are less generous. But the real peril lies further down the line, when countries emerge from lockdown blinking into the harsh light of reality. Spain and Italy, at the sharp end of Covid-19â€™s impact, already have economies in tatters from the Eurozone crisis a decade ago, while the mood music from Germany is hardly one of boundless benevolence. Italy beware. The glint in Von Der Leyenâ€™s eyes suggests that any real help offered once the medical crisis is over will come with all the EUâ€™s usual hallmarks.

445,Highly unlikely U.S. Open would be held without fans: USTA head - Reuters,Frank Pingue,"(Reuters) - The organizers of the U.S. Open said on Thursday a decision on whether to hold the Grand Slam this year amid the coronavirus outbreak will be made in June, and playing it without fans is on the table but highly unlikely. The U.S. Open, which is scheduled to run from Aug. 31 to Sept. 13, is both the largest and loudest of the four Grand Slam events on the tennis calendar and United States Tennis Association (USTA) chief executive Mike Dowse does not anticipate that changing. â€œPlaying without spectators, weâ€™re not taking anything off the table right now, but to be honest and open, I think thatâ€™s highly unlikely,â€ Dowse said on a conference call. â€œThatâ€™s not really in the spirit of the celebration of tennis. It also goes back to the health and wellbeing of not just the spectators but of our players and support staff that help run the tournament.â€ The U.S. Open is held annually in New York City, which is the hardest hit U.S. city in the coronavirus pandemic and this week revised its official COVID-19 death toll sharply higher to more than 10,000. The USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, which is the home of the U.S. Open, has even been turned into temporary hospital to help in the battle against the coronavirus. Last yearâ€™s U.S. Open drew an all-time attendance record of nearly 740,000 fans and the event is the engine that drives the USTA, which is governing body for the sport in the country. The French Open, the first Grand Slam to be hit by the spread of the coronavirus, moved the claycourt event to Sept. 20-Oct. 4 from its traditional May start while the Wimbledon championships, set to begin in late June, were cancelled. â€œTime is on our side at this point,â€ said Dowse. â€œObviously our ambition is to run the tournament.â€ Dowse said the USTA will make a decision on whether it is safe to stage the U.S. Open after consulting doctors. â€œThings are fluid. If the medical experts come back and say here is a foolproof way of running a very safe tournament, unfortunately it has to be without fans, we may reconsider and look at it at this point,â€ said Dowse. â€œToday itâ€™s just too early to kind of speculate on what the exact specifics will be at that time.â€ Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto, editing by Pritha Sarkar",0,
535,Lockdown police rights in full: The things you CAN and CANâ€™T do as police detail rules | UK | News | Express.co.uk,Myriam Toua ," The new police lockdown rules come as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is standing in for the Prime Minister as he recovers from coronavirus in his Chequers country home, extended the lockdown for a further three weeks, subject to review. In response, officers have issued guidelines on what is a â€˜reasonableâ€™ excuse to leave the house, including but not limited to food shopping. Acts which are allowed include buying a small amount of a staple item or necessity and buying tools to repair a fence broken down by bad weather. Brits will also be allowed to stop to eat lunch to break up a long walk, or driving to the countryside and walking, where the idea is that more time will be spent walking than driving. Employees will still be allowed to travel to work, whether or not they fall under the key worker category, as long as they are not able to do this work from home. However, police have also issued some non-reasonable reasons for going out, which they expect nobody to do. People have been told they are not allowed to be working from home in a local park or public bench for long periods of time.  The rules in full for what you are allowed to do:  You are not allowed to:  The three-page document, which was released on Thursday and entitled â€œwhat constitutes a reasonable excuse to leave the place where you liveâ€, is designed to help police enforce the lockdown measures. The set of rules was produced by the National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing, and appears to be drawn from guidelines issued by the Crown Prosecution Service. A spokesman from the College of Policing said the information had already been published for forces before the Easter Bank Holiday Weekend. They added: â€œIt was designed to help officers remain consistent with criminal justice colleagues.â€  The new rules come as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the Government would be extending the lockdown measures in place for another three weeks, subject to review. Speaking at the daily press conference at Downing Street, Mr Raab said: â€œThere are indications that the measures we have put in place have been successful in slowing down the spread of this virus. â€œBut SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) also say that is a mixed and inconsistent picture and, in some setting, infections are still likely to be increasing.â€ The R0 value, the rate of infection, was â€œalmost certainly below one in the communityâ€, meaning infected people were passing the virus on to less than one person on average. Mr Raab continued: â€œBut overall, we still donâ€™t have the infection rate down as far as we need to.  â€œWeâ€™ve come too far, weâ€™ve lost too many loved ones to ease up now, especially when weâ€™re beginning to see that our efforts are starting to pay off. â€œThere is light at the end of the tunnel but we are now at both a delicate and a dangerous stage in this pandemic. â€œIf we rush to relax the measures that we have in place we would risk wasting all the sacrifices and all the progress that has been made. â€œThat would risk a quick return to another lockdown with all the threat to love that a a second peak of this virus would bring and all the economic damage that a second lockdown would carry. â€œWe need to be patient a while longer, so please please stay at home, save lives and protect the NHS.â€ See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",0,
210,Dr. Anthony Fauci is continuing Obama’s mission to cripple America and turn it into a vaccine police state,Mike Adams,"Former President Barack Obama had a mission for America: Destroy it!

And he pursued that “sleeper cell” mission for eight years, whipping up racial tensions, turning America against law enforcement, socializing the medical system and even allowing people like Joe Biden to transfer classified military secrets to China in exchange for fiAnonymouscial kickbacks that were laundered through Ukraine.

As we’ve previously warned, Obama also allowed China to steal the Pentagon’s US military personnel records. He even allowed Iran to “capture” a US military drone and a Navy boat, all as part of a grand scheme to make sure Iran acquired US communications encryption hardware. If that weren’t enough, Obama then laundered billions of dollars through international banks to fund Iran’s nuclear weapons program, all while lying to America and claiming the “Iran nuclear deal” would block Iran’s nuclear ambitions (it did precisely the opposite, enabling the program and funding it). Barack Obama is a treasonous traitor who used his eight years in the White House to try to destroy America and enrich its enemies. Now, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who worked as one of the top-level operatives inside the NIH during the Obama years, is attempting to complete the work that Obama started.

The Dr. Fauci suicide pact for America
In the last few days, Dr. Fauci has demanded that the entire nation remain locked down until every last infection is snuffed out. He wants the entire population to remain in quarantine lockdowns, in other words, until no more new infections are detected across the entire country. This is an impossible standard to achieve and would likely result in the whole country being locked down for a year or more, utterly destroying what’s left of the US economy.

It should be no surprise this was always part of the plan to destroy personal health freedom and roll out a medical police state run by vaccine zealots. Dr. Fauci is a puppetmaster for the vaccine industry and claims nothing can stop the virus except a non-existent vaccine. As part of the NIH, Dr. Fauci helped funnel hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money into the biological weapons / vaccine industry (it’s the same industry, just two different faces). He’s currently downplaying hydroxychloroquine + zinc, a combination that has so far achieved an astonishing cure rate among coronavirus patients, because he’s trying to position his buddies in the vaccine industry to reap windfall profits from whatever vaccine they come up with, which will of course be heralded as the savior of humankind.

Until the vaccine is ready, Dr. Fauci wants to keep everybody locked in their homes, perhaps for an entire year to come. As Tucker Carlson correctly observers, this is tantamount to “national suicide.” Dr. Anthony Fauci is a dishonest vaccine propagandist who has previously claimed that MMR vaccines don’t cause encephalitis. This is, of course, a flat-out lie that Dr. Fauci continues to push in order to bury the truth about the dangers of vaccines. See this video clip:

Now, Dr. Fauci is spearheading the push for nationwide vaccines, infection tracking and surveillance, and seemingly endless house arrest, a form of nationwide imprisonment that will only be lifted when you are vaccinated (at gunpoint) by an authoritarian government run by the medical police state. This is the end game for the vaccine industry: Turn you into a prisoner until you submit to be jabbed with their dangerous toxins that could contain anything from heavy metals to aborted human fetal tissue.

Dr. Fauci won’t dare mention zinc, vitamin D or anything that works, for fear the coronavirus might be stopped before the vaccine is available
Ultimately, Dr. Fauci is actively working to suppress information about lifesaving treatments and cures such as hydroxychloroquine and zinc, along with other immune-boosting nutritional solutions like vitamins C and D. Dr. Fauci doesn’t want the coronavirus to be defeated until the vaccine comes along, so low-cost treatments are being ignored or trashed. It’s all part of his narrative to shape the story line so that vaccines will be the hero and vaccine mandates will be forever enshrined in US law.

That’s the goal: Turn the United States into a Big Pharma-run medical police state, where anyone who opposes vaccines is criminalized, arrested and silenced, communist China style.

Dr. Fauci has a communist mindset. He’s a liar and a tyrant, and his ultimate goal here is to see the coronavirus inflict maximum pain, suffering and death across America so that he can engineer a “vaccine coup” and portray himself as the savior of the nation. Sadly, President Trump played right into Fauci’s hands by denying the severity of the virus for far too long, allowing it to replicate to the point where over a hundred thousand Americans might die this year alone. That plays into the contrived narrative of the vaccine zealots who see mass death as their greatest opportunity to push vaccine mandates and steamroll “anti-vaxxers” who question vaccine safety.

If we let the vaccine tyrants win, America will be lost and the people will be left to suffer and die in order to protect an industry of death and destruction (the vaccine industry). What’s the solution? End the lockdowns with these four powerful tools:
I believe we could end the lockdowns by putting four simple things in place:

1) Everybody needs to wear a mask.

2) Everybody takes zinc + vitamin D.

3) Hydroxychloroquine must be made widely available to treat serious patients. (And possibly Ivermectin.)

4) The government must start testing asymptomatic people to identify stealth carriers.

With those four things, we could simultaneously defeat the coronavirus while ending the lockdowns, all without waiting around for a vaccine that might prove more dangerous than the epidemic itself.

Yet because of Trump’s lack of understanding, we now have pro-Trump people claiming they refuse to wear masks, because they won’t be “enslaved” like China. That’s foolish. Wearing a mask is the quickest way to help defeat the globalists by halting the coronavirus. Wearing a mask is an act of rebellion against the slavers who hope to keep the coronavirus spreading.

The globalists want America to be destroyed. They want the pandemic to spread, and they want maximum infections and deaths in the USA. To stop their agenda, we need everyone to take zinc and vitamin D while wearing masks (in public) and practicing safe social distancing. That’s how we end this as soon as possible and get America back to work and back on track.

Watch and share this important mini-documentary so that we can defeat the Obama-Fauci “death agenda” to destroy America and get this nation back on track.

38,Watch: Mike Pence Caught on Hot Mic Asking if He Can Carry Empty PPE Boxes Into a Nursing Home ‘For the Camera’,David Badash,"Vice President Mike Pence, in charge of the President’s Coronavirus Task Force, was caught on a hot mic asking if he could carry empty boxes of what had housed personal protective equipment (PPE) off a van and into the front door of a nursing home “for the cameras.”
Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel mocked the vice president.
“Here he is, with no mask on, wheeling boxes of PPEs into a health care center, and doing his best to lift them,” Kimmel said, narrating the video. “What a hero.”
“And since it was going so well, and also because he didn’t realize he had a mic on, Magic Mike decided to keep it going.”
Someone tells Pence, “Those are empty sir.”
“Well, can I carry the empty ones, just for the camera?” Pence asks.
“Mike Pence pretending to carry empty PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he’s doing. A big box of nothing delivering another box of nothing.",1,
444,'We're treated like criminals': South Korean sect feels coronavirus backlash | World news | The Guardian,Nemo Kim in Seoul,"Had it been any other week, Ji-yeon Park, a 26-year-old nail artist, would have been at her twice-a-week bible study with her fellow Shincheonji worshippers. Instead, she says, her life has come to a halt as she worries about her church and if she, too, has been infected. Jiyeon is one of 230,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a doomsday sect at the heart of the Covid-19 outbreak in South Korea, and she says she is scared of being found out about her faith. Authorities believe a large number of cases are members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus or have been in contact with someone who is. With about 80% of the 1,766 cases connected to the sect, fear and hatred towards the church is on the rise. But Ji-yeon says blaming the church is unfair. â€œOur church didnâ€™t invent the virus. This is just an excuse to shift blame. Throughout history, minority groups have always been blamed for bad things happening in society. The same is happening to us.â€ Ji-yeon joined the church two years ago, when she first came to Seoul from Geochang, South Kyungsang province, an hourâ€™s drive from Daegu, the epicentre of the South Korea outbreak. Feeling lost in the big city, she says, a colleagueâ€™s invitation to join a free acupuncture class came as a pleasant surprise. â€œI didnâ€™t know they were Shincheonji at first but they were kind and always there for me. Two of them even cried with me when my boyfriend broke up with me. So it didnâ€™t matter too much when they told me the truth later. Why should it matter when other so-called honest people can be horrible and cruel for no apparent reason?â€ Ji-yeon says she has been contacted by her local district public health office and has been advised to be on self-confinement despite not having any symptoms. She says she did not attend the Daegu services earlier this month that authorities believe sparked the spread of the virus via an infected church member, a 61-year-old woman known as â€œpatient 31â€. â€œWeâ€™re being treated like criminals. We had a bad image before and now I think Iâ€™d be lynched if passers-by knew I belonged to Shincheonji.â€ Those who escaped the church, however, feel differently. Speaking to Korean media, Advent Kim, a former Shincheonji member who now works as a counsellor to help families affected by the sect, says the situation cannot be resolved without drastic action. â€œThey teach members that itâ€™s OK to lie about their faith just to protect the organisation. How can you call it a religion when they teach lying? Everyone is brainwashed to blindly follow orders. Authorities must somehow get the cult leaders to give the appropriate orders for all members to come out of hiding so they can all get tested before it gets even worse.â€ South Koreaâ€™s vice-health minister, Kim Gang-lip, said on Thursday that officials had secured the list of 212,000 Shincheonji members and were expected to complete collecting biological samples from 1,300 members of the Daegu branch who were showing symptoms. He said the ministry was trying to obtain from the church a list of about 90,000 members-in-training. Advent Kim says the churchâ€™s lack of cooperation lies at the core of its recruitment method. â€œThey donâ€™t tell newcomers they are Shincheonji at first. Only after they feel that the newcomer is ready to accept them do they come clean. By then, most choose to stay, as did I. Members-in-training most likely donâ€™t know the group they belong to is Shincheonji, thinking they are attending a career or hobby-related group for acupuncture or pet grooming.â€ Kim adds that more experienced members are ordered to infiltrate other churches to recruit members. Members are ordered not to tell family about their membership or to use the internet. â€œThey have recruitment competitions and there are fines for members who cannot fill their quota.â€ As authorities rush to find the connection between the sect and Wuhan, it has been alleged that the church operated a branch there. A recording has emerged of one of the cult leaders in which he refers to their Wuhan branch. â€œNo Shincheonji member in Wuhan has contracted the virus thanks to their faith,â€ he says. After the recording was made public, the sect admitted there were about 300 active members in Wuhan, although there is scepticism about the churchâ€™s activities there. Since the outbreak in Daegu, South Korea has spiralled into a state of national emergency. With 13 dead and 1,766 cases, authorities have advised citizens to wear a mask at all times, but supply is limited. Many companies have told employees to work from home and avoid face-to-face meetings. The US-South Korea combined forcesâ€™ command training was cancelled for the first time due to the spread and the Korean Catholic church announced it would not hold masses until the beginning of March, a first in the countryâ€™s 236-year history of Catholicism. More regions of Korea have stopped accepting flights from Daegu, and as the city suffers a shortage of medical staff, some 500 medical doctors around the country have volunteered to work in the virus-ridden city. Despite this, Daegu is struggling to keep up with the infection cases, with more than half of those confirmed to be infected with the virus told to stay at home due to a lack of hospital beds. Young-il Cho, who runs a pharmacy opposite what turned out to be a Shincheonji study centre in Yangjedong, Seoul, says he cannot believe the turn of events in the past few days. â€œA lot of young people used to go into that building and there was loud wailing day in, day out. I wondered if they were a cult but didnâ€™t expect them to be connected to the virus. What is the point of me selling all these masks here if theyâ€™re spreading the virus right across the road?â€ Mi-soon Jeong, a server at a nearby restaurant, is more sympathetic. â€œI donâ€™t condone them but in a way I donâ€™t blame them for joining a cult,â€ she says as she sprays disinfectant onto tables. â€œYou canâ€™t find good jobs nowadays and people are so unhappy and lonely. It is hard for people.â€",0,
375,Petrobras Suspends All Employee Travel To China | OilPrice.com,Irina Slav,"Brazil&rsquo;s Petrobras has suspended all employee travel to China because of the coronavirus outbreak that has reportedly already entered Brazil itself.  Reuters reports that the country&rsquo;s health ministry said there were nine suspected cases, and advised locals to refrain from traveling to China.  Petrobras, for its part, said that while employee travel will be suspended, shipments of oil to China will continue.  The coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, has spread across more than a dozen countries and has infected more that 6,000 people. The death toll is rising, too, with the latest figure at 160.  The outbreak has shaken commodity markets with a particularly hard impact on oil prices. Investment banks warned of a sizeable downside risk for benchmarks from the outbreak, which could&mdash;and most probably would&mdash;affect China&rsquo;s economic growth and hence its oil demand.  The impact is already being felt after the institution of quarantines at a time of the year that normally sees increased passenger traffic during the Lunar New Year holidays. With people now obliged to stay at home, this travel is simply not happening.  If oil demand does weaken for an extended period of time, Brazil will be among the most affected suppliers of crude to China. The bulk of Petrobras&rsquo; oil exports during the first nine months of 2019 were bound for China, Argus Media writes, citing company data. That was 72 percent of the almost half a million bpd Petrobras shipped abroad.  Purchases for January and February stand at over 500,000 bpd as the light and medium oil pumped from the Lula field in the presalt zone has become a favored feedstock among independent Chinese refiners.  &ldquo;For the export of oil to this country, there are no changes in the schedule and possible logistical adjustments are being studied,&rdquo; Petrobras told Argus.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",0,
317,"WRAPUP 11-Coronavirus cases in China's Hubei fall for second day, Apple and markets feel impact",,"markets feel impact@ (Adds new cases and deaths in Hubei) * New infections fall for second day in Hubei * Deaths in Hubei at 132, up from 93 previous day * Experts say too early to tell if China outbreak contained BEIJING/GENEVA, Feb 18 (Reuters) - New coronavirus cases in the Chinese province at the epicentre of the outbreak fell for a second straight day, but deaths rose after the World Health Organization had cautioned there was not yet enough data to know if the epidemic had slowed. Hubei reported 1,693 new cases as of Tuesday, down from 1,807 the previous day and the lowest number in the province since Feb. 11. But deaths rose by 132, up from 93 the previous day. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 with about 2,000 deaths. The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the novel virus first appeared at the end of last year. Illustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains. World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data ""appears to show a decline in new cases"" but any apparent trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously."" Outside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan. Tedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China. ""We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,"" he said. Russia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens. By the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19. ""Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours,"" Tedros said. China says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan. The WHO's Mike Ryan said China had success with ""putting out the fire"" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored. ""Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,"" Ryan said The numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious. Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients. GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS Despite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China's ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be ""limited, short-term and manageable"" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed. Chinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic. Economists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon. ""The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,"" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast. Britain's biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus. Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world, and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods. Singapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact. Japan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.

164,Is there a doctor in the house? Nevada state medical team that banned malaria drug for coronavirus lacks qualification,Anonymous,"Nevada’s top health officials lack the qualifications one might expect in leaders making public health recommendations for the US, but that hasn’t stopped them from attacking a potential Covid-19 treatment.
Trump’s detractors in the Nevada state health department have moved heaven and earth to stop doctors in the state from prescribing two drugs the president deemed promising for treatment of coronavirus, insisting he’s not qualified enough for his opinion to outweigh a lack of medical consensus. However, a few Twitter detectives discovered on Wednesday that these “professionals” don’t seem to have all the necessary licenses and qualifications to practice medicine in the US either. At the urging of his state medical advisors, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak banned the use of FDA-approved malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat coronavirus in an emergency order issued on Tuesday. 

The order tightly restricts supply of the drugs, limiting even non-coronavirus cases to a 30-day supply. Sisolak, a Democrat, explained it was a safety measure to prevent hoarding of the malaria medicines and ensure continued supply to the patients who desperately need them.

Pushing the loudest for the restrictions had been Ihsan Azzam, Nevada’s chief medical officer. While Azzam has a masters degree and prior experience in environmental public health and epidemiology, fulfilling the qualifications required to hold the state post, his only experience actually practicing medicine came from an obstetrics and gynecology department in an African hospital over two decades ago. Azzam is thus not qualified to actually practice medicine in the US, nor does he have any experience treating respiratory conditions, and his advice to Sisolak appeared to some to be motivated more by anti-Trump sentiment than genuine medical concern. It’s not clear how many malaria patients Nevada typically sees in a given year - the mosquito-borne illness is exceedingly rare in the US, and was even declared eliminated in 1951 by the Centers for Disease Control - but the decision to essentially put them ahead of potential coronavirus sufferers raised some eyebrows, especially among Trump supporters familiar with the president’s interest in the drugs. Nor is it only Azzam potentially dispensing unqualified medical advice to Nevadans. Another researcher pointed out that both Nevada’s medical epidemiologist and state epidemiologist also seemed to lack the necessary qualifications to “make medical decisions related to infectious disease.” Medical epidemiologist Stephanie Woodward has a doctorate in psychology, not epidemiology or public health; while state epidemiologist Melissa Peek-Bullock has just a BS in health ecology. While her resume touts her leading roles managing various local disease outbreaks, she lacks even a Masters in Public Health and neither woman appears to have attended medical school.

Many on social media were shocked that there was not a single practicing medical doctor among the trio, and a petition to recall Sisolak as governor even began gathering momentum.",1,
273,"Africa may see millions of coronavirus cases, tentative WHO forecast shows - Reuters","Duncan Miriri, Katharine Houreld","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Coronavirus cases in Africa could shoot up from thousands now to 10 million within three to six months according to very provisional modelling, a regional World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thursday. But Michel Yao, head of emergency operations for WHO Africa, said that was a tentative projection which could change and noted worst-case predictions for the Ebola outbreak had not come true because people changed behaviour in time. â€œThis is still to be fine-tuned,â€ he told a media teleconference. â€œItâ€™s difficult to make a long-term estimation because the context changes too much and also public health measures when they are fully implemented, they can actually have an impact.â€ The worldâ€™s poorest continent has seen more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease and about 900 deaths so far - relatively little compared to some other regions. But there are fears that could balloon and overwhelm shaky health services. â€œWe are concerned that the virus continues to spread geographically, within countries,â€ said Matshidiso Moeti, director for WHOâ€™s Africa region, which comprises 46 sub-Saharan nations and Algeria. â€œThe numbers continue to increase every day.â€ Infections in South Africa, which has the highest number of cases, have slowed after it began a strict lockdown, but other nations - like Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Algeria - have seen higher than average fatalities. The WHO is working with authorities there to improve patient care and reduce fatalities, Moeti said. She warned that President Donald Trumpâ€™s withdrawal of U.S. funding for the WHO could harm both the fight against against other killers like polio, HIV and malaria. â€œThe impact, potentially, of this decision will be quite significant on areas such as polio eradication,â€ said Moeti, just when Africa was close to being declared polio-free. Trump accused the Geneva-based WHO on Tuesday of promoting Chinese â€œdisinformationâ€ about the new coronavirus, saying this had probably worsened the outbreak and that he would stop its funding even as he defended his own handling of the crisis. More than 2 million people have been infected globally, with the largest number in the United States. Washington is the biggest donor to the WHO, which tackles specific diseases and also strengthens national health systems. The United States contributed more than $400 million to the WHO in 2019, roughly 15% of its budget. â€œWe are very much hoping (suspension of funding) will be re-thought because the U.S. government is an important partner not only in financial terms but also it is an important strategic partner,â€ Moeti said. She also told the media teleconference that the organisation requires $300 million to help African governments respond to the pandemic.

Morrison said these three steps will be finished within four weeks, and Australia will then review the restrictions that include curtailing the movements of residents, and the closures of schools, restaurants and pubs.

509,WHO says threat of pandemic 'has become very real' even as China recoveries rise,William Feuer@WillFOIA,"The threat of a global pandemic is rising as the new coronavirus rapidly spreads across the world from Asia, to Europe, the Middle East and now parts of the United States, World Health Organization officials said Monday. ""Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on a conference call from the organization's Geneva headquarters Monday. While the virus is slowing in China, where it originated in December, it's picking up pace across other parts of the world, spreading to more than 100 countries with more than 111,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Korea has the most cases outside of China with roughly 7,500 infections, followed closely by Italy and Iran, which both had more than 7,000 cases as of Monday morning, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. In the U.S., the number of cases erupted over the last week to more than 560 spread across at least 30 states, according to Johns Hopkins. WHO officials stopped just short of calling a global pandemic, indicating that they are getting closer to making the declaration â€” even as China and Singapore appear to have successfully contained the spread in their countries. ""When you reach 100 countries and when you reach 100,000 cases, it is time to step back and think, two weeks ago it was 30 countries,"" said Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO's emergencies program. Tedros said only a handful of countries ""have signs of sustained community transmission,"" adding that it's still too early for world leaders to give up. He said 70% of the more than 80,000 confirmed cases in China have recovered and been discharged from the hospital, saying the outbreak there may be ending. ""China is bringing its epidemic under control,"" he said. While China appears to be on the mend, Ryan said the disease hasn't ""run its course"" in other nations. In fact, he said, some countries are just importing their first cases. ""We're still very much in the up cycle of this epidemic, and there are still a number of miles to go,"" Ryan said. WHO officials said some countries have been able to slow down, and even stop, transmission â€” pointing to Singapore. Whether a country controls an outbreak depends on how quickly and how much world leaders do to contain the spread in their individual countries. ""It is in our hands. ... In many countries, it will get worse before it gets better,"" said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead of WHO's emergencies program. Roughly 93% of the global cases are concentrated in four countries: China, Korea, Italy and Iran, they said. Roughly 80 countries have less than 100 cases each. ""Absolutely, we see a light at the end of the tunnel, but how quickly we get there depends on what countries do."" WHO officials shed more light on the severity of the disease. They have previously said about 80% of the people who catch COVID-19 develop mild symptoms while 20% of the patients develop severe symptoms. The ""mild"" cases include mild forms of pneumonia, Van Kerkhove said. WHO officials said some medical conditions, including heart disease, respiratory disease, cancer and diabetes, will place people at a higher risk for death. In China, the death rates among people over 80 is the highest â€” over 20%. Tedros said it's ""dangerous"" to assume COVID-19 kills only older people. ""The death rate from this outbreak is high. We shouldn't categorize by young or senior. Of course to understand the epidemiology, it's fine to do that, but for action, I think every life matters,"" Tedros said. ""This is a moral decay if we try to categorize it that way, a moral decay of society."" This is breaking news. Check back here for updates.",0,
133,BREAKING: Autopsy reveals Wuhan Doctor didn't die of coronavirus; he was murdered in sick bed,Anonymous,"An autopsy supervised by the Chinese Police has revealed that Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn the world about the coronavirus outbreak was murdered.

News broke out that the doctor died after contracting the virus while treating patients in Wuhan. His death sparked widespread of public anger and grief in China which called for an independent autopsy to be conducted.

A statement by the police says six heath care officials have been arrested in connection with the doctor's death.",1,
23,The Deadly Hidden Formula Behind the Coronavirus: 5G + Common Cold (CC-33) = COVID-19,Anonymous,"As most people would know by now several cities in the World have announced 5G roll outs through various wireless telecommunication providers over the past two years. I live in the Toronto, Canada area and the city has been looking at going full-on 5G for the past year and a half. Going 5G may give the public better access to wireless networks and hot spots, but there are several nuances associated with going full out 5G. Outside of the need for thousands of transmitting towers for the 5G frequency there are some health risks obviously involved. I am sharing with you one of the BEST one hour videos that I have watched on 5G and it’s possible connection to the Coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Wuhan was one of several Chinese cities that went heavy on 5G technology in 2019. By December – when the Coronavirus was ramping up – Wuhan and it’s 11 million citizens were given 10,000 towers as a 5G gift that went ‘hot’ effective October 31st (Happy Halloween). As you will hear from Dana Ashlie and her breakdown of the Coronavirus in China and how she relates the technology of 5G behind it you will hear some interesting case points that will make one think that there may be more to this ‘wireless connection’ then meets the ‘invisible’ eye.

239,"Smoke fags, save lives",CHRISTOPHER SNOWDON,"There’s not much to laugh about these days, but the news that smokers might be protected from Covid-19 is certainly one of them. With study after study showing that smokers are under-represented in coronavirus wards, the renowned French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux, is working on a randomised control trial to test the effect of nicotine patches on Covid-19 patients.
This is far from being a crackpot theory. Changeux has explained his hypothesis at length here. In simple terms, he says that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a key role in the development of the disease and that nicotine can put a brake on it. If he is right – and the banter heuristic says he is – it would not only save thousands of lives but would also be one in the eye for the ‘public health’ groups who have been claiming that smoking and vaping are risk factors for Covid-19.
These groups are so used to lying with impunity that they wasted no time in asserting that smoking caused coronavirus complications when the pandemic began. In the US, newspapers have been filled with reports that smokers and vapers ‘may’ be at greater risk from Covid-19, a weasel word that requires no evidence. A group of doctors in New York urged governor Andrew Cuomo to ban the sale of all tobacco and e-cigarette products on the false premise that ‘mounting evidence demonstrates the link between tobacco use and increased risk for progressive Covid-19’. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has been taking occasional breaks from flattering the Chinese Communist Party to make evidence-free assertions about smokers being ‘likely’ to suffer more from the coronavirus.
Three weeks ago, Public Health England fished around in the emerging literature and found a study from China involving a grand total of five smokers hospitalised with Covid-19, of whom three suffered severe symptoms. From this crumb of evidence, they made the astounding claim that ‘smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease’.
The quango should have paid more attention to how few smokers were in hospital in the first place. In a country where 27 per cent of adults smoke, only 6.4 per cent of the Covid-19 cases were smokers. This was not a fluke finding. Awkwardly for the anti-smoking lobby, smokers have been strangely under-represented in all the studies for which smoking prevalence data is available. They made up just 1.4 per cent of the cases in Zhang et al, 6.7 per cent in Wan et al, 3.9 per cent in Mo et al, seven per cent in Huang et al, nine per cent in Dong et al, 10 per cent of cases in Yang et al, 1.9 per cent in Guan et al, six per cent in Zhou et al, and 6.4 per cent in Liu et al. In Shi et al, only 8.2 per cent of cases had any smoking history. Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos of the University of Patras in Greece noticed this phenomenon early on and put a preliminary study online in late March. It noted the ‘unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalised Covid-19 patients’, which ‘does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalisation for Covid-19, and might suggest a protective role’.
A few days earlier, a group of doctors from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital had written to the British Medical Journal to point out that nicotine protects against the kind of acute inflammatory reactions seen in Covid patients and that ‘the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed’. Nobody paid much attention, but evidence supporting the smoking hypothesis continued to slip out.
On 3 April, the US Centers for Disease Control published data on thousands of American Covid-19 cases. Once again, the proportion of smokers was tiny – just 1.3 per cent. Even ex-smokers were significantly under-represented (2.3 per cent).
The most comprehensive epidemiological study appeared a week later. Based on data from 4,103 Covid patients in New York City, a team of researchers found that a history of smoking was associated with a 29 per cent reduction in risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 and, contrary to the claims of Public Health England, smokers were no more likely to become critically ill with the disease if they were admitted. The authors would have found an even sharper reduction in risk for current smokers if they had split them up from ex-smokers in their analysis, but even the findings as published were striking. This week, a group of French academics published their study of 343 Covid patients, of whom only 4.4 per cent were daily smokers. According to the authors, the study ‘strongly suggests that daily smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population’. This seems to have been the study that prompted Professor Changeux to go public with his research project.
People scoffed when Emmanuel Macron exempted tobacco kiosks from France’s lockdown on the basis that they provide an essential service. Who’s coughing now?
Far be it from me to preempt the conclusions of the professor’s research, but let us consider for a moment the policy implications of nicotine being the only tried and tested prophylactic for Covid-19. We could issue Lucky Strikes on prescription. We could #ClapForOurCigarettes every Thursday evening. The case for closing down Public Health England would be stronger than ever. We could open the pubs, but only to smokers and vapers. We might allow a few non-smokers in to enjoy the possible benefits of passive exposure, but only if they stand two metres apart. There is everything to play for.
The icing on the cake would be if British American Tobacco is first out of the blocks with a vaccine. Everyone who works for the World Health Organisation would have to go unvaccinated on principle and rely instead on herd immunity. Smokers would, of course, be pushed to the front of the queue for vaccination. They paid for it, after all.
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But, by God, wouldn’t it be fun?",1,
167,The Latest Plague So Far Is a Brilliant Success,"Stephen Karganovic
","The wicked social control experiment using virus as the pretext for further enslavement is performing magnificently by implanting a sense of helplessness, dependence, and blind conformism. It should be noted that the favorable atmosphere enabling Them (whoever they are) to accomplish just that was contrived by the controlled and unscrupulous media in under a month of intense, coordinated, global brainwashing. Praise is in order, not for the obviously immoral master plan but for the technical excellence of its execution. In the subservient Balkans, local  quislings have expectedly introduced a practically region-wide state of emergency, giving that ignoble set of local petty tyrants broad powers to impose controls and reorder the pattern of everyday life. Hardly noticed by anyone, the operation has closely followed the choreography set by Germany’s infamous Ermächtigungsgesetz of 1933, the immediate pretext being the only major substantive difference between them. Similar restrictions and intrusions have been enjoined in all the leading “western democracies” as well.

The background of the induced panic has been dealt with cogently and  extensively by Prof. Igor Panarin (here and here). An indirect corroboration for Prof. Panarin’s “hypotheses” (as he modestly likes to call them) is the official redesignation of the heretofore bland sounding “COVID-19” as the “Chinese virus”, personalizing at last the maligAnonymoust invisible enemy. German physician Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg has argued that corona has been known for decades to be an integral part of the viral structures attacking our bodies on an annual basis, to which the human immune system has by and large successfully adapted,

It seems that the enemy’s sudden onslaught was anything but uAnonymousticipated, however. Curiously, evidence has just emerged that a few months before the viral outbreak that is shaking the world, on October 18 2019, an interesting gathering was hosted in New York City by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Bloomberg School Of Public Health, World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It was organized under the code-like name of “Event 201.” The gathering received scant media attention and the remarkable prescience of its participants was left completely and unjustly unremarked. To add another curious detail to these proceedings, one of the key players, Bill Gates, turns out to be a known champion of (a) radical population control (and here), and (b) mass vaccination. Without casting any aspersions, it just so happens that in practical terms the two issues are closely entwined. Mass vaccinations, preferably starting with the forced vaccination of very young children with substances of unknown but suspicious proveAnonymousce and composition, may be but a step in the population control program, whether by directly injecting debilitating conditions and diseases or provoking sterility, which ultimately comes down to the same thing.

Indeed, the biggest “known unknown” (as once someone famously put it) of the coronavirus affair may be precisely the nature of the vaccine which will probably be generated by the same pharmaceutical establishments which so presciently foretold the onset of the current crisis. Since the crisis was elevated to a global level, it is not beyond belief that the remedy will also be imposed globally. The reputedly high infectiousness of this sinister “Chinese virus” may be a perfect excuse for doing away with inconveniences  like choice, and suchlike niceties, once it is decreed that everyone is required to submit meekly to the injection of the opaque substance billed as just-in-the-nick-of-time solution for the distressed world.

Which brings us to another curiosity striking the alert observer whose television set, of course, is permanently turned off or, if it is switched on. it is for nothing more prosaic than to watch cooking shows. Forget high government officials who have dropped dead in the sanctioned and embargoed Middle Eastern country which bears the brunt of the public animosity of the Western world. They deserve it, naturally, because they hate our freedoms. But one is hard put to explain, never mind justify, the virus’ apparent easy access to many high-profile Western figures, many of them conspicuous in public life or the world of entertainment. Their susceptibility guarantees the wide dissemination of the message that Covid-19 is no respecter of persons and that if it happened to them, you may be next. To mention just a few of these luminaries, testing positive so far have been the Game of Thrones actor Kristofer Hivju, Hollywood star Idris Elba, and the rightfully famous Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, not to mention sports figures such as Kevin Durant or even former NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, whose misfortune is unlikely to encounter any sympathy in Serbia. Why are these high-profile infections curious? Because these are people who do not walk the crowded streets or use public transport; typically they glide around in their limousines. How did they get infected? Or were they, perhaps, exemplarily and discreetly infected precisely in order to maintain the believers in official facts in a hysteric state and to drive home the point that the day of reckoning is indeed nigh.

We still can only speculate about much to do with this vicious plague. But all is not darkness, as we learn from this sermon by a wonderful American Orthodox priest, Father Josiah Trenham, “Virus chaos and Christian fearlessness.” It could not have been said better.",1,
117,Vatican confirms Pope Francis and two aides test positive for Coronavirus,Anonymous,"The Vatican has confirmed in a statement that Pope Francis and two of his aides have tested positive for the novel Coronavirus.
The three new cases add up to the over 400 cases confirmed in Italy under a week.
Pope Francis missed a planned Mass with clergy in Rome yesterday after showing Coronavirus-like symptoms.
The Vatican had earlier said the pontiff, 83, had a slight indisposition and could proceed with the rest of his planned work today.
The pope and his aides have been quarantined and receiving medical attention near Santa Marta, the Vatican hotel where he lives.
The pope was seen coughing and blowing his nose during the Asha Wednesday Mass.
Yesterday, he told well-wishers: ‘I wish, again, to express my closeness to those who are ill with coronavirus and to health-care workers who are caring for them’
It comes amid an outbreak of the strain of coronavirus- also known as Covid-19 – in Italy that has infected more than 400 people, almost all of them in the north.
Rome had three cases, but all three have recovered.
Francis had been scheduled to go to the St John Lateran basilica to meet with Rome clergy and celebrate a penitential Mass at the start of Lent.
The Argentine pope has generally good health he lost part of one lung as a young man because of respiratory illness and suffers from sciatica, which makes walking difficult.",1,
182,Chinese military website: Wuhan Coronavirus is manmade by the U.S.,GM35,"On Feb 1, 2020, the most influential Chinese military website www.xilu.com published an article to acknowledge that the Wuhan coronavirus is manmade accusing the U.S. of creating such bioweapon against china.

According to Miles Guo, the publication of this article became a turning point in the history of mankind. It opened Pandora’s Box of the Chinese Communist Party. During the Korea War, the Chinese army was attacked by the American’s bacteria weapons.

Many do not believe that the US used any bacteria weapons. But this should not be a surprise. The US used gasoline bombs and poison gas to attack the Chinese army without winning the war. In the end, Truman even assessed the use of an atomic bomb.

In the 1930s, the US planned to use poison gas to attack a Canadian harbor. In 1971 Cuba had African swine flu. In 1975, the US joined the “Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention”, and destroyed those weapons in 2015 but still kept the viral samples and 78% of its weapons made before 1997.

This is the cruel nature of our enemy and the war has never left us.

We think that our enemy has been armed to the teeth, but actually they are more prepared than that. If we don‘t stand on guard, we may lose our ability to fight back in the face of apocalyptic weapons. That’s why Chairman Mao insisted on building nuclear weapons to deter our enemies. In 2018, Putin confirmed that the US was collecting genes from the Russian people. This became a concern because they did not want the genes collected to be used to make bacteria or biological weapons targetting them.

In 2019, Russian revealed that the US established over 200 labs for biochemical weapons around the world to develop a new generation of biochemical weapons, which is restricted by international conventions. America established such labs in countries surrounding Russia which made the Russians very uncomfortable.

The author points out the timing of the African swine flu in the midst of the US-China trade war. China never had African swine flu before, but is now facing a severe outbreak. It is spreading out of control. This puts pressure on the Chinese fiAnonymouscial system due to inflation induced by rising pork prices.",1,
196,THE CORONA VIRUS LIES ARE TOO MANY TO CONTAIN,The Healing Oracle Team,"Is the Corona virus really just a global version of the children’s story “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” this year’s big threat to humanity that is destroying our freedom of choice and liberty?

You are being lied to.

They say America is the land of the free. What happened there?

No need for real life battles anymore when the corona virus can take care of the seismic power shift all on its own. This time the bad guy could be our next door neighbour.

As the body of evidence mounts, we want to show you just some of the people coming forward to now question this mass global (pandemic) pandemonium that is CO-VID 19. Named in 2019 this is a rebrand of the flu. Problem with the Flu is that no one is scared of it anymore. Whilst the vaccine was proven so woeful in its attempts to stop it last year that the CDC had to admit it failed a whopping 91% of the time. So it needed a new name. A rebrand.

Update: What if you found out that the Coronavirus is actually on the list of ingredients of the Flu shot? Therefore anyone that has had a Flu vaccine could test positive for Corona virus. It’s right here on the insert under side effects. Courtesy of Goy Brian Pearce who spotted this.

The coronavirus is in the flu vaccines
The coronavirus is in flu vaccines

Surely, it has gone too far now and the economic fall out to this “pandemic” far outweighs the shaky numbers and scientific “facts” we are being bombarded with by the centralised News corporations that are owned by the very same people that have a huge vested interest in their new untested vaccines.

Fear is a terrible thing. It’s bad for your health and closes down large sections of independent cognitive function.

Billions of people are now out of work thanks to a virus that has actually been around for years.

As we reported on Wednesday this week, the introduction of 5G, Digital microchips and enforced vaccines are now going unchallenged thanks to the coronavirus and the 24-hour news stream of information about the coronavirus “pandemic.”

We are now seeing something far more terrifying, the submissive subtle introduction of a military medical state that has been spun out to such a degree that is has now become the will of the people.

It’s a very carefully laid out plan. Is this perhaps the precursor to these truly alarming numbers?

Is Corona virus the excuse to introduce more vaccines and more radiation emitting technology that will make these figures a reality?

Cancer is here to stay.

Anyone remember Sadam Hussein and his fictitious “weapons of mass destruction” that became the justification for the invasion of Iraq? Each year there is a new virus, disease, or movement that suddenly and swiftly rears its head, sent from Satan himself, it’s here to threaten our way of life and kill us all. HIV, Swine flu, Bird flu, ISIS, whatever this common trending enemies name may be, we run in fear and wait for our governments help to come and fight the bad guy. Go get them guys!

Many of the emergency measures that were put in place at these times and under the guise of terrorism paved the way for the emergency measures we are now seeing, that justify yet more laws being passed quickly and easily, circumnavigating the usually slow democratic process.

After all, “Democracy” tends to muddy the waters if you want to centralise everything. Please see some of the following pieces of evidence now circling the globe that will make you see the Corona virus in a whole new, far less terrifying light than the one that is portrayed by state owned Television and their shiny made up graphics.

Look at these 2 images below, spot the difference. How do we know the image below is in New York? This is actually a hospital in Italy.We are being constantly told what to think.

We say enough is enough!

Take a breath

We urge you to look at this story with some rationality and imagine for a second you did not own a TV and had perhaps been in a blissful coma for the last two months.

You’d wake up as many probably do thinking the world had gone bonkers.

Reflect on the fact that the CDC is in fact a vaccine company, owning the patent on 56 vaccines currently in existence, with a further 271 in the pipeline, whilst good old Bill Gates and his charades continue. The second richest (recorded) man on the planet has invested a lot of money in his ID chips and global vaccines and needs his return on investment.

ID2020 is an ambitious project by Microsoft to solve the problem of over 1 billion people who live without an officially recognized identity. ID2020 is solving this through digital identity.

He is also the most powerful man at the World Health Organisation.

This is nothing more than global power play.

Even if you read no further, please consider these facts: Is this a test to see how many will submit?

Is this time that the tide turned and people took back some of their own free will?

The real agenda that is being hurried through the corridors of power in every major industrial country RIGHT NOW is the creation of further centralised control amidst the erosion of your free will and independent basic human rights.

The coronavirus statistics are blinding people to the reality and playing with peoples lives on a vast scale.

London authorities caught in the act

Please watch this video where the authorities are called out for posting their panic filled propaganda in London.

The irate lady had just fed a homeless man that was taken away. Then she gets a letter through her door saying the man had died of the Corona virus 2 hours ago. She is understandably livid.

They even remove their masks once they are called out: So if the tests are fake and wrong, what are we all so worried about?

What is this huge distraction that has closed airports and meant the police patrol the streets? ",1,
